Aliyu Giwa, a police officer in the force public relations office (FPRO), says it is mandatory for hospitals in Nigeria to treat victims of gunshot wounds before requesting a police report. In a tweet on Monday, Giwa said the Treatment and Care for Victims of Gunshot Act, 2017 states that every hospital in Nigeria whether public or private shall treat with or without police clearance any person with gunshot wounds. “The Treatment and Care for Victims of Gunshot Act, 2017 Section 1 – 15 says that: Every hospital in Nigeria whether public or private shall accept or receive for immediate and adequate treatment with or without police clearance any person with gunshot wounds,” he said. ”Every person including security agents shall render every possible assistance to any person with gunshot wounds and ensure that the person is taken to the nearest hospital for immediate treatment.” ”Accordingly, no person with gunshot wound shall be refused immediate and adequate treatment by any hospital in Nigeria whether or Preservation of not initial monetary deposit is paid.” But he added that the Act said gunshot wounds should be reported within two hours of treatment and that the victim cannot participate in the investigation unless certified fit by the medical officer. “Any hospital that fails to give the information required under sec 4 of this Act commits an offense and on conviction, shall be liable to a fine of N100,000 and every doctor directly concerned with the treatment shall be liable on conviction to 6 months imprisonment or both,” he said.
