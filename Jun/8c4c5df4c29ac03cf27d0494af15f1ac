Omoyele Sowore, presidential candidate of the African Action Congress (AAC), has announced Haruna Magashi as his running mate for the 2023 general election. Haruna Magashi is a lawyer from Kano state. Sowore announced Magashi as his running mate on Thursday in Abuja, saying the lawyer has what it takes to support the party to be victorious in Kano and other states in the 2023 polls. He added that Magashi’s name had earlier been submitted to the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) as the party’s vice-presidential candidate. “We hope to defeat the All Progressives Congress over there because the governor has messed up. We know that we will defeat PDP, that’s the party that’s in crisis as we speak,” Sowore said. “We don’t need to talk about the Labour Party in Kano because the party doesn’t exist. “We know that we will defeat Alhaji Kwankawso and his party, the New Nigeria Peoples Party, in Kano because we have got someone who is from there.” The Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) had fixed February 25, 2023 as the date for the presidential and national assembly elections, while the governorship and state house of assembly polls will take place on March 11, 2023.
