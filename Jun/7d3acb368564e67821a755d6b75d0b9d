Rotimi Akeredolu, governor of Ondo, says the federal and state governments failed to protect victims of the attack on St. Francis Catholic Church, Owo. On June 5, gunmen attacked the church, with 40 people confirmed dead after the incident. On Friday, the funeral for the slain worshippers was conducted at the Mydas Resort and Hotel in Owo. The names and photographs of those who were killed in the church were published in the funeral handbook, while 74 names were listed as those who sustained injuries during the attack. Speaking during the funeral, Akeredolu said those who committed the attack are “evil” people. “We have failed to defend these people. Not because we have not tried, but because these forces on the other side are evil and they have support. They will not triumph over us forever,” he said. “When I see the sea of heads that are here, it speaks volumes. What has happened to us in Owo in Ondo state is indescribable. “A lot of words are used to qualify it — dastardly, horrendous. I still believe there are words to use to describe it, but I am still short of those words. “We have just 22 (referring to the deceased) in this hall. A few of them have been buried because the relatives couldn’t wait till today. But as at the last count, these animals came to the church and murdered 40 people.”
