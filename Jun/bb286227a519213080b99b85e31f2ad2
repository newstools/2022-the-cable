Ademola Adeleke, governorship candidate of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP), says he is prepared to curb insecurity in Osun state. The former senator said this in the governorship debate organised by the BBC on Thursday. The state’s election is scheduled to take place on July 16. Speaking on the issue of insecurity and how it relates to Western Security Network, better known as Amotekun, Adeleke said he will empower the outfit to enable them to tackle insecurity in the state. He said to tackle insecurity, he will provide the necessary equipment to the security outfit in the state if elected governor. Adeleke said he will prioritise salaries of security personnel in the state, adding that without it the outfit will be compromised. “I studied criminology and that makes me equipped to tackle insecurity in the state. To do this, we must pay the salaries of the security workers, because if we do not, they won’t be able to work very well,” he said. “We ask the governor where our helicopter is? If the government fails to provide necessary equipment for security outfits, how do they expect them to handle insecurity in the state? “So, if elected governor, I’ll make sure that necessary equipment is made available for our security personnel.” Reacting to the issue of vote buying, Adeleke said he is against it, adding that the people of Osun should vote their conscience. “The electoral act forbids vote buying. I’m also totally against it and I advise the people of the state to shun vote buying and go out to vote their conscience,” he said.
