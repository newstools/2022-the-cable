Adegboyega Oyetola, governor of Osun, has expressed optimism about his re-election bid in the state’s forthcoming election. The Osun governorship election is slated for July 16. Oyetola spoke on Sunday while addressing members of the Osun chapter of Nigerian Incorporated Practitioners. The governor was represented by Olatunbosun Oyintiloye, his special adviser on civic engagement. He said his votes would surpass the performance of the All Progressives Congress (APC) in the recently-concluded Ekiti election. “For me, defeat is not an option in the coming election. The victory that will be recorded in the election through the popular votes of the electorate will surpass that of Ekiti state,” he said. “We are prepared for the election, and it will not be out of place to extend hands of fellowship to everyone to join us in moving the state forward. “I want to emphasise that failure is not an option, but victory is certain by the grace of God.” Oyetola said his efforts to improve workers’ welfare, the economy of the state, education, agriculture, and youth empowerment, among others, would be sustained if re-elected. He called for the electorate’s support while encouraging them to get their permanent voter cards (PVC). “I still want to implore those who are yet to get their PVC to go get it because, without it, you cannot vote for me,” he said. “I know you appreciate what we are doing in the state, and for you to return the favour, get your PVC and vote for me and APC.”
