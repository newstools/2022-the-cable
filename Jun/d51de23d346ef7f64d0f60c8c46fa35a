The Nigerian Female Yellow-Greens continued with its winning streak at the ongoing women’s T20 international cricket tournament in Kigali, Rwanda on Saturday as they defeated Botswana by seven-wicket. The Yellow-Greens are now top of the table in the competition after winning its previous two games against Brazil and Germany. Losing the toss and being sent into the field — a tactic that seems to have favoured the Nigerian women before Saturday’s game — the Yellow-Greens seized every opportunity to defeat their opponents. Opening bowler Racheal Samson and Rukayat Abdulrazaq ensured that they conceded no run in the first two overs, claiming a wicket in the process. A partnership between Botswana’s Florence Samanyika and Shameelah Mosweu seemed to steady the ship with 29 runs scored by the sixth over, but Samanyika was caught out by Agatha Obulor, who landed on her shoulder while attempting the catch and needed the attention of the medics before she was replaced by Kehinde Abdulquadri. Mosweu 24(21) and Tuelo Shadrack 26(29) recorded the best batting performance for the Botswana side
and their efforts helped the ICC-ranked 42nd team finish their innings at 88/5. Opening batter Omonye Asika 33(50) kept it safe for Nigeria and an eventual pairing with captain Blessing Etim 19(21) in the ninth over meant the team would need only 15.2 overs to finish the game, scoring 89/3. The Nigerian team will face two-time winner Uganda at the IPRC cricket oval on Sunday.
