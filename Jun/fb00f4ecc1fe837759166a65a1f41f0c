Emeka Alaehobi, a youth leader of the All Progressives Grand Alliance (APGA), has been killed by gunmen in Anambra state. Alaehobi was said to have been killed in Utuh, a community in Nnewi south LGA on Saturday. The youth leader was reportedly abducted on Thursday after gunmen raided his residence in Ukpor community. His lifeless body was said to have been found at a junction in Utuh, a few kilometres from Ukpor, where he was kidnapped. Tochukwu Ikenga, police spokesperson in Anambra, confirmed the development to TheCable on Saturday evening. “The corpse has been removed by some persons we were yet to identify, before our operatives got to the scene,” he said. “Further enquiries made by our operatives from an eyewitness in the area, later identified the victim as one Emeka Alaehobi who was abducted on 9/6/2022 from his residence at Ukpor, Nnewi south.” The police spokesperson said operatives are on the trail of the attackers, adding that the perpetrators will be made to face justice. The south-east state has been a target of gunmen strikes in recent months. The assailants’ latest attack comes days after a woman and her four children were killed by gunmen in a community in Orumba north LGA of the state. A week before the killing of the woman and the children, Okechukwu Okoye, lawmaker representing Aguata II constituency in Anambra state, was beheaded by gunmen. Okoye, an indigene of Isuofia, the same community as Chukwuma Soludo, governor of Anambra, was murdered after he was kidnapped alongside Cyril Chiegboka, his campaign director.
