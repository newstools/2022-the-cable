Jose Peseiro, the newly-appointed Super Eagles head coach, has lost his first two games in charge of the team — following their 1-0 defeat to Ecuador. The match played in the early hours of Friday was the concluding fixture of the Super Eagles tour in the United States, where they had lost 2-1 to Mexico last week. Peseiro began the game at the Red Bull Arena in Harrison, New Jersey, with just one change to the starting line-up of his first game. The Portuguese replaced Innocent Bonke for Sanni Faisal in the midfield. It took the Ecuadorians just three minutes to the game to get the lone goal they needed. Pervis Estupiñán was the goal scorer and his precise strike was the difference as the Eagles unsuccessfully chased the match for the following 87 minutes. The Eagles are billed to commence their 2023 Africa Cup of Nations (AFCON) qualifying series against Sierra Leone at the MKO Abiola National Stadium, Abuja, on June 9. Peseiro will be hoping to galvanise his players and tactics before the journey to Cote d’Ivoire 2023 kicks off.
