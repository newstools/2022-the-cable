Twelve members of a family have been found unconscious in their house in Obokwu community of Obinze in the Owerri west LGA of Imo state. The family members were said to have been found unconscious in their apartment on Monday, and were rushed to hospital for medical attention. Shortly after their arrival at the Imo state specialist hospital in Umuguma, Owerri, five out of the twelve victims were said to have been confirmed dead. The remaining victims are currently receiving medical attention. The cause of the incident could not be ascertained by residents. A source from the community, who pleaded anonymity, however, said Kingsley Oguzie, the head of the family, was involved in a land dispute with another family from the same community. “Currently, the wife of the late Kingsley is in coma, while two of her children have been revived in a prayer house in the community,” the resident said. When contacted, Micheal Abattam, the state police spokesman, said the incident had not been reported to the police. He, however, promised to provide more information when available.
