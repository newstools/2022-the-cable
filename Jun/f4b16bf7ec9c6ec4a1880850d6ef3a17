The Nigerian Meteorological Agency (NiMet) says it is planning to install lightning detector systems in 10 airports across the country. Mansur Matazu, director-general, NiMet, disclosed this on Wednesday while receiving lightning detection systems donated by the Earth Network in Abuja. Some of the airports include; the Nnamdi Azikiwe International Airport, Abuja, Benin Airport, and the Murtala Muhammed International Airport, Lagos. Matazu said the detectors were the outcome of the memorandum of understanding (MoU) signed between the agency and Earth Network in August 2021. He added that the provision of the equipment and system “did not cost the country a dime”, adding that staff members would be trained on the use of the equipment. He also said NiMet received an automated weather observing system (AWOS), lightning detectors, and their required accessories. “As part of the execution of the MoU, the agency has received 10 AWOS, 10 lightning detectors and their required accessories at no commercial value to it,” he said. “The equipment will be installed at NiMet facilities and partner institutions in Nigeria to enhance the quality of the dataset required to fulfil the terms of the MoU.” Last year, the NiMet director-general had called on the private sector to partner with the federal government in the area of infrastructural development to improve weather services.
