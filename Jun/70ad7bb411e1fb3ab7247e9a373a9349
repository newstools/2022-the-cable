Reports on social media claim that by the end of the year, the Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN), will stop the provision of Form A, which aids the payment of tuition fees for Nigerians studying abroad. Through the ‘Form A’ provision, Nigerians studying abroad access foreign exchange at the official rate rather than sourcing from the parallel market which is always significantly higher. <img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-718102" src="https://f5p3e9e4.stackpathcdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/WhatsApp-Image-2022-06-29-at-8.23.58-AM.jpeg" alt="" width="1080" height="607" srcset="https://f5p3e9e4.stackpathcdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/WhatsApp-Image-2022-06-29-at-8.23.58-AM.jpeg 1080w, https://f5p3e9e4.stackpathcdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/WhatsApp-Image-2022-06-29-at-8.23.58-AM-300x169.jpeg 300w, https://f5p3e9e4.stackpathcdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/WhatsApp-Image-2022-06-29-at-8.23.58-AM-1024x576.jpeg 1024w, https://f5p3e9e4.stackpathcdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/WhatsApp-Image-2022-06-29-at-8.23.58-AM-768x432.jpeg 768w, https://f5p3e9e4.stackpathcdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/WhatsApp-Image-2022-06-29-at-8.23.58-AM-24x13.jpeg 24w, https://f5p3e9e4.stackpathcdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/WhatsApp-Image-2022-06-29-at-8.23.58-AM-36x20.jpeg 36w, https://f5p3e9e4.stackpathcdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/WhatsApp-Image-2022-06-29-at-8.23.58-AM-48x27.jpeg 48w" sizes="(max-width: 1080px) 100vw, 1080px" /> Nigerians on social media have raised concerns over the news suggesting that effectively from January 2023, payments of overseas tuition fees will cost more. “I just read that from December 2022, the CBN is canceling Form A. Prospective International Students from Nigeria will have to get FX for their school fees from the black market. It keeps getting worse,” says Adewale Adetona, via a post on Twitter that gathered 179 retweets, 22 quote tweets, and 368 likes. I just read that from December 2022, the CBN is canceling Form A.

Apparently Manchester Metropolitan University sent this circular alleging that CBN is withdrawing form A by end of 2022 for fee payments.

Verification Osita Nwanisobi, director of the corporate communications department of the CBN, said the purported advisory by the Manchester Metropolitan University is false and unfounded. “The CBN has not issued such a policy,” Nwanisobi said. He cautioned concerned parents and students to disregard any advisory to pay up as much portion of their outstanding fees as possible, through Flywire, prior to December 31, 2022. Verdict The CBN is yet to make an official policy declaration that Form A will discontinue by the end of 2022. The claim attributed to the CBN is false.
