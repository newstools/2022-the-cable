The Birnin Gwari Vanguard for Security and Governance, a group, has urged travellers to avoid the Kaduna highway until security challenges in the area are addressed. On Tuesday, some travellers were reportedly kidnapped by bandits along the Birnin Gwari-Kaduna highway, with eight vehicles set ablaze during the attack. According to a statement by Ibrahim Nagwari, chairman of the group, the highway has been under attack for the past four days. He added that the security situation needs urgent intervention. “We always appreciate the efforts of security personnel in their passion to curtail the precarious insecurity bedeviling Birnin Gwari general area,” he said. “But our people have reach a point of no return, hence the need for the people of Birnin Gwari and communities along the Kaduna-Birnin Gwari highway to halt with immediate effect travelling on this notorious highway from tomorrow till security situation improves. “While politicians are engaged on their mission to clinch power come 2023, none of the gladiators seeking for elections has any agenda of emancipating our people from the bondage of terrorists and miscreants. “More so, none of these politicians deem it fit to visit Birnin Gwari to either see delegates, but rather called delegates to Kaduna for consultations. “This organisation hereby advises all our citizens to exercise maximum restraint and obey all rules of the land and seclude themselves in prayers for Allah’s intervention to deal with the terrorists and their collaborators within our communities.”
