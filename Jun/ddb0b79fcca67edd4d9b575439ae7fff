Professor Yemi Osinbajo (PYO) presidential campaign council says the vice-president has not stepped down from the presidential race. Osinbajo is one of the presidential hopefuls of the ruling All Progressives Congress (APC). The campaign council, in a statement signed by its director of media, Richard Akinnola, said delegates should disregard various fake news making the rounds that Osinbajo has pulled out of the race. “The PYO Presidential Campaign Council welcomes our distinguished delegates from across the country to Abuja for our presidential primaries,” the statement reads. “As you settle down in Abuja, we implore you to kindly disregard various fake news making the rounds that Prof. Yemi Osinbajo has stepped down.” “The purveyors of these fake news are afraid of the huge political support base of Vice President Prof. Yemi Osinbajo.” The campaign council added that the vice-president is not contemplating dropping his bid to succeed President Muhammadu Buhari. “Please note that no such action is being contemplated. Prof. Yemi Osinbajo is the leading aspirant, as attested to by the report of the party’s screening committee. He is ready for the primaries and very sure of his victory,” the council said.
