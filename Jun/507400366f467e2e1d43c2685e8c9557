Gboyega Oyetola, governor of Osun, says he pays N800 million to retirees in the state monthly. He said this in the governorship debate organised by the BBC on Thursday. The state’s election is scheduled to be held on July 16. The governor, who is the All Progressives Congress (APC) candidate in the election, said he has not owed pensioners since he assumed office in November, 2019. He said every month he pays N500 million as pension to retired workers in the state, adding that he also pays N300 million as gratuity. “I have never owed pensioners their money. Every month, I pay them N500 million as pension, while I also disburse N300 million as their gratuity,” he said. “Death is a natural occurrence, It’s not in our hands but for retired workers in Osun, my government doesn’t owe them and we do everything to take care of them. Reacting to question on workers’ salaries, Oyetola said since the start of his administration, workers have always received their full salary. Oyetola was the chief of staff to Rauf Aregbesola, former governor of Osun and minister of Interior, when workers were paid part salary. But in response to the question, the governor said the practice of paying workers part salary is in the past.
