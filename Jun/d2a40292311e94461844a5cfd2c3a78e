The National Working Committee (NWC) of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) says it will repeat legislative primary elections in Lagos, Imo, Benue and Katsina states. In a statement by Debo Ologunagba, PDP national publicity secretary, the party’s NWC said the decision was reached following a “very careful deliberations” of electoral and appeal panel on the congresses of the affected states. He said the party agreed that primaries held in Ahiazu and Orsu constituencies of Imo, Musawa, Dandume and Zango state constituencies of Katsina, Oru East/Orsu/Orlu federal constituency of Imo and Kwande/Ushongo federal constituency of Benue will be rescheduled to June 5. According to him, the party also agreed that all the 24 house of representatives primaries in Lagos will be rescheduled to June 6. “Furthermore, Kaduna Central Senatorial District of Kaduna State, Enugu West Senatorial Districts of Enugu State as well as Boki/Ikom Federal Constituency and Yakuur II State Constituency, both of Cross River State earlier scheduled for Saturday June 4, 2022 have been cancelled,” he said. TheCable had reported how the Imo state chapter of the PDP suspended its state house of assembly and house of representatives primaries as a result of an “error” in the Electoral Act 2022. The PDP also cancelled all primaries in Ebonyi state following “thorough deliberations and review” by the NWC.
