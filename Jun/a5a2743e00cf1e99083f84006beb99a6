The federal government says it is worried about the lingering strike by the Academic Staff Union of Universities (ASUU). ASUU had, on February 14, declared a one-month warning strike to protest the non-implementation of its demands by the federal government. On March 14, the union extended the industrial action by eight weeks, citing the government’s failure to fully address its demands. Subsequently, the union extended the strike by another 12 weeks. Aside from ASUU, the Senior Staff Association of Nigerian Universities (SSANU), Non-Academic Union of Universities and Associated Institutions (NASU), as well as the National Association of Academic Technologists (NAAT) have also suspended services over “government insensitivity” to their demands. Speaking on Wednesday after the federal executive council (FEC) meeting, Lai Mohammed, minister of information and culture, said the issue with the unions is not as simple as assumed. He, however, added that the issues with universities shouldn’t affect government’s efforts to improve other areas of the education sector. “I don’t think because we’re having challenges with the university lecturers, we should stop primary school students from continuing with their education,” he said. “And I wish that the ASUU issue is as simple as many of us think it is. I don’t think it’s that simple. But I want to assure you that a lot is going on behind the scenes. “I think probably the minister of education will be better positioned to give the details. But like any government, if we’re not concerned, we would not set up all the committees which have been working. “If we are not concerned, we will not be looking for means to even assuage the feelings of the union. “We’re worried. We’re concerned, and we’ll continue to work towards finding an early resolution of the problem.” He added that the federal government has approved the set-up of satellite-based systems for e-learning centres for primary schools across the country.
