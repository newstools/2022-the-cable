The Economic and Financial Crimes Commission (EFCC) has arrested some suspects for engaging in vote buying in the ongoing Ekiti governorship election. In a video published by Channels Television, EFCC operatives raided a building to arrest the suspects. In the video, the suspects were caught with packages containing money and books containing details of voters in certain polling units. Some of the suspects were paraded at Oke Ori Omi police division. Inducing voters with money and other materials is an electoral offence in Nigeria. Earlier, Kemi Elebute-Halle, governorship candidate of the Action Democratic Party (ADP) in Ekiti, alleged that other political parties are inducing voters with money in the ongoing election. “At my polling unit here — ward 10, unit eight — we are aware that APC has started buying votes for the sum of N10,000; PDP are buying for N5,000 and SDP for N3,000,” Elebute-Halle said. Also, Segun Oni, SDP governorship candidate, said he received reports of vote buying in Oye LGA of the state. “I have received reports of vote buying in Oye,” Oni said.
