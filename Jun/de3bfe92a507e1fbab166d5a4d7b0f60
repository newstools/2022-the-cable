Nicolas Felix, a presidential hopeful under the All Progressives Congress (APC), has congratulated Bola Tinubu on his victory at the presidential primary of the All Progressives Congress (APC). Tinubu, former governor of Lagos, at the conclusion of voting on Wednesday, polled a total of 1,271 votes to secure the presidential ticket of his party. In a statement on Tuesday, Nicolas, a US-based Nigerian pastor of the Miracle Church International, pledged his support for Tinubu’s presidential campaign in the 2023 general election. “I want to congratulate his excellency Asiwaju Bola Ahmed Tinubu on your victory at our party primaries and your emergence as the presidential candidate of our great party, the APC, for the forthcoming 2023 presidential election,” Felix said. “I also congratulate President Muhammadu Buhari and all leaders of the APC for a successful special convention and presidential primary. “For many decades, you have shown passion, patriotism, courage and determination in the course of nation-building. Your sterling contributions to our democracy and its progress stand you out. “Your wealth of experience will certainly be critical in our party’s continued efforts to attain a more secure and prosperous Nigeria. “To all members of our great party, regardless of who you voted for at the primaries, we must now unite behind our presidential flag bearer to ensure victory for our party in the 2023 elections. “As true progressives, we must remain strong and united in pursuing our collective vision as a party towards building a country that can provide a decent life and livelihoods for all our people.” Felix, the 40-year-old presidential aspirant, had stepped down before voting commenced at the presidential primary.
