Bola Ahmed Tinubu, former Lagos state governor, is on course to win the presidential primary of the All Progressives Congress (APC) by a wide margin. Following the completion of the vote-sorting process, he was ahead of his fellow challengers in the race by a mile. From the votes sorted so far, Tinubu has secured over 1000 votes while his closest challenger, Rotimi Amaechi, the minister of transportation, polled 316 votes. Vice-President Yemi Osinbajo secured 235 votes while Yahaya Bello, governor of Kogi state, got 47. Ahmed Sani Yerima, former Zamfara governor, secured four votes while Ogbonnaya Onu polled just one vote. Rochas Okorocha, Tunde Bakare, and Tein Jack-Rich failed to secure a single vote in the presidential primary. Senate President Ahmad Lawan polled 152 votes while Ben Ayade, Cross River governor, was able to secure 37 votes. Chukwumemeka Nwajuiba, former minister of state for education, had just one vote, while Dave Umahi, Ebonyi state governor, polled 38. The total number of votes secured by Tinubu is yet to be determined as the counting is still ongoing at Eagle Square, Abuja.
