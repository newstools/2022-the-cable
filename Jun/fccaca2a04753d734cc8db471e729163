Atiku Abubakar, presidential candidate of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP), says his running mate, will be an asset to the party’s campaign. On June 16, Abubakar named Okowa as his running mate for the 2023 presidential election. In a message to Nigerians on Sunday, Atiku said the office of the president requires clarity of mind on decision-making. He added that the decision of picking a running mate — and how it was done in countries that have acquired more experience in democratic acculturation — provided a window of assessing preparedness for the job that lies ahead. He said in meeting up with the expectation, and more importantly to ensure that he makes a pick of a running mate that Nigerians would be proud of, it became necessary to be introspective about his choice. “The Governor of Delta State, Okowa, and I share a lot of personality attributes in common. He is a fine gentleman, but tenacious,” NAN quoted him as saying. “His experience as a senator will come in handy in some of the legislative reforms that are urgently needed to reformat our governmental processes. “Okowa and I are incurable optimists in the future of Nigeria and the promises it holds as one united, peaceful and prosperous country. “Having him on the ticket brings a lot of asset to our campaign.” He added that in the months ahead of the general election, he and Okowa together with PDP leaders and Nigerians would work hard to ensure a convincing victory for the party. “A victory for the PDP in the general election is a victory for Nigeria. When we win, Nigeria wins,” he said. “The stakes in the election are very high, and it gives me tremendous joy that I can count on your support to win the election and get to work in earnest.”
