Mahmood Yakubu, chairman of the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC), says permanent voter cards (PVCs) are not for opening bank accounts. The INEC chairman urged youths who have obtained their PVCs to endeavour to vote during the general election. Yakubu spoke on Saturday during the Youth Vote Count concert at the Old Parade Ground, Abuja. The campaign was launched by INEC and civil society organisations in partnership with European Union (EU), to encourage more youths to register and vote in the 2023 elections. On June 11, the Lagos leg of the concert took place at the Tafawa Balewa Square and was graced by several Nigerian music artistes. Speaking at the Abuja event, the INEC chairman said the commission registered 14,000 Nigerians in five days at the venue of the concert. Yakubu said those who recently registered to vote will collect their PVCs before October 2022. “When will your PVCs be ready for collection. I want to assure you that the PVCs will be ready for collection latest in October this year, long before the election. So all of you will have your PVCs,” the INEC chairman said. “I want to thank you for making the PVCs the most popular ID in Nigeria, today. But when you collect your PVCs, don’t use the PVCs for other things. The PVCs are for elections not for the opening of bank accounts. So please use your PVCs for elections.”
