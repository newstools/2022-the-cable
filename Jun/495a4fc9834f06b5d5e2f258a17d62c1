Tobi Amusan, Tima Godbless, Praise Ofoku, and Praise Idamadudu have won a gold medal for Nigeria in the women’s 4x100m final at the ongoing African Athletics Championship. The relay team dipped 44.45 seconds to finish ahead of South Africa and The Gambia — who clocked 44.87 and 44.97 seconds, respectively — to retain their title on Friday at the Cote d’Or national sports complex in Mauritius. Amusan is the only member who remained from the team that won gold in Asaba in 2018, alongside Joy Udo-Gabriel, Blessing Okagbare, and Rosemary Chukwuma. In women’s discus, Chioma Onyekwere also retained the title from four years ago as she achieved 59.19 meters throw to clinch the gold medal. Cameroon’s Monie Nora Atim took silver as Nigeria’s Obiageli Amaechi won the bronze medal after throwing a mark of 54.15 meters. The victories swell Nigeria’s medal haul at the championship to three gold, two silver, and one bronze. Earlier on Friday, the men’s 4×100 meters team narrowly missed the podium after placing fourth behind Kenya, South Africa, and Zimbabwe in that order. In the women’s 400 meters race, Patience Okon-George finished fifth in the final after clocking 52,98 seconds.
