Three members of the Civilian Joint Task Force (CJTF) have been reportedly killed in an attack by suspected members of the Islamic State in West African Province (ISWAP) at the residence of humanitarian workers in Monguno, Borno state. During the attack, TheCable learnt that the insurgents reportedly abducted three humanitarian employees of Damuli Investment Limited. According to an intelligence source who spoke to Zagazola Makama, a counter-insurgency expert in the Lake Chad region, the insurgents carried out the attack on Monguno LGA around 9pm on Friday. The counter-insurgency expert said the insurgents who invaded the community through Marte (another Borno town), went straight to the residence of the humanitarian workers and began shooting. The source said the ISWAP insurgents attempted to steal three vehicles, but could not take them out of the compound. Zagazola said the insurgents later proceeded to a compound owned by the State Emergency Management Agency (SEMA) and stole one Hilux vehicle before proceeding to attack and kill three members of the CJTF. TheCable learnt while the CJTF vehicle was burnt, one other member of the task force was shot in the leg.
