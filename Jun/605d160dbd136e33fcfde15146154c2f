The St Francis Catholic Church in Owo LGA of Ondo state was attacked by gunmen on Sunday. TheCable understands that the incident, which occurred on the church premises, left many dead and several others injured. The gunmen were said to have detonated explosives in the church after which they proceeded to fire several shots at the congregation. Children are believed to be among those killed in the attack. A witness, Kehinde Ogunkorode, said the incident caused pandemonium in the area as residents, who were taken by surprise, ran for safety. The worship centre is directly behind the palace of the Olowo of Owo. “As we were about to end the service, we started hearing gunshots and dynamites. Some of us locked ourselves in for some time. When we came out, we saw corpses all over the floor,” a priest in the church told BBC. The injured victims have been taken to St Louis Hospital and the Federal Medical Centre in Owo. The casualty figure from the attack is yet to be ascertained. The development comes two weeks after a cleric of the Church of Nigeria (Anglican Communion) and his son were abducted by gunmen along the Ifon-Okeluse road in Ose LGA of the state. The abductors later contacted the family members of the victims and demanded the sum of N10 million as ransom. Editor’s note: This report has been updated with new information.
