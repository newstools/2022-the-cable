Biodun Oyebanji, the All Progressives Congress (APC) governorship candidate in Ekiti state, has won his polling unit by a landslide. Oyebanji secured 296 votes in polling unit 003, ward 06, Ikogosi, Ekiti West LGA. Bisi Kolawole, the candidate of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP), secured just one vote while Segun Oni, the Social Democratic Party (SDP) flagbearer, polled zero. Kemi Elebute-Halle, the candidate of the Action Democratic Party (ADP), had earlier alleged that other political parties were inducing voters with money. Elebute-Halle spoke with TheCable after voting at polling unit eight, ward 10, Ikole LGA. The female governorship candidate alleged that the APC, PDP and SDP were buying votes with N10,000; N5,000, and N3,000 respectively. Elebute-Halle eventually lost her polling unit to Oyebanji, placing third overall. She secured 32 votes, Oyebanji had 47 votes while Oni polled 39 and Kolawole got 21. Meanwhile, Oni, the SDP candidate, won his polling unit in Ido-Osi LGA with 218 votes. The voting process has been concluded across all the local government areas in the state, with results starting to trickle in. Although voters arrived early in most of the polling units, the exercise commenced late in Ikogosi — the LGA of Oyebanji. TheCable’s reporters observed several incidents of vote-buying by agents of the political parties involved in the governorship election.
