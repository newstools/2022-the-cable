Twenty people have been injured in a gas explosion at a Liquefied Petroleum Gas (LPG) refiling shop in Kano state. The explosion also razed shops. According to NAN, the explosion occurred in a busy area of Sheka quarters, Karshen-Kwalta in Kano, around 8:30pm. A cylinder reportedly caught fire and exploded, razing three shops and part of a house attached to one of the shops. A witness identified as Abubakar was quoted as saying many people were taken to hospital with burnt flesh. Abubakar reportedly said those inside the shops and the people living close to the gas station were mostly affected by the incident. When contacted, Saminu Yusif, public relations officer of the Kano State Fire Service, confirmed the incident. He said 20 people were injured, but are now receiving treatment in hospitals. Yusif said the explosion was caused by fire from a man frying and selling fish near the gas shop. In May, a gas cylinder explosion was recorded near a primary school in Sabon Gari area of the state.
