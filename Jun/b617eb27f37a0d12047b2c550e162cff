The Super Eagles have claimed a come-from-behind 2-1 win over Sierra Leone in their 2023 Africa Cup of Nations CAFCON) qualifying game. In the thrilling match that was played at the MKO Abiola Stadium, Abuja on Thursday evening, Victor Osimhen scored the winner for the Super Eagles, who were stretched by their visitors. The Nigerian team started the game strongly but it was  Sierra Leone who took the lead in the 12th minute. Sahr Jonathan Morsay took full advantage of Mohammed Kamara’s cross to silence the hosts. The Super Eagles weren’t under pressure despite the early setback as they kept bombarding the visitors. The pressure from the hosts finally paid off in the 16th minute after Moses Simon’s brilliant pass fell to Alex Iwobi who fired home a low curler to level the scoreline. Nigeria then took the lead through a brilliant 41st minute strike from Osimhen who cracked home a superb header after combining well with Simon. The second half was very scrappy as both sides struggled to create chances in Abuja. There were, however, some nervy moments for Nigeria in the closing stages of the game. The result is a relief for Portuguese tactician Jose Peseiro who lost his first two games in charge of the Eagles — although they were friendly matches. In the other Group A match, Guinea Bissau thrashed Sao Tome and Principe 5-1. On Saturday, the Eagles will fly to Marrakech for the second qualifying game against São Tomé and Príncipe which will take place on June 13.
