Ibrahim Kassim, Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) governorship candidate in Bauchi, has withdrawn from the race. According to NAN, Malam Yayanuwa, PDP spokesperson in Bauchi, confirmed the development on Tuesday. TheCable had reported how the former secretary to the Bauchi state government got 655 votes to clinch the PDP governorship ticket unchallenged. Yayanuwa said Kassim attributed his withdrawal from the race to “personal reason”. The PDP spokesperson said the party will make a decision on the development soon. “The only option left for the party is to forward the name of his replacement to INEC for proper documentation,’’ he said. The development comes about 24 hours after TheCable reported that Bala Mohammed, governor of Bauchi, was trying to reclaim the PDP governorship ticket after losing the party’s presidential primary election. Sources had told TheCable Kassim only stood in as a proxy for Mohammed. At the party’s presidential primary election on Saturday, the Bauchi governor finished in fifth position, securing only 20 votes. Former Vice-President Atiku Abubakar polled 371 votes to become the standard-bearer of the party. With Kassim’s withdrawal from the race, Mohammed is set become the PDP governorship candidate in the state.
