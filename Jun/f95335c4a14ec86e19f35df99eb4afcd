The Catholic Diocese of Pankshin, Plateau state, has dissociated itself from the action of a priest who prevented worshippers from attending mass. On Sunday, a video of a priest, said to be from a Catholic church in Plateau, went viral as the cleric prevented residents without permanent voter cards (PVCs) from attending mass. Speaking on the development in a statement issued on Monday, Andrew Dewan, director of communications of the diocese, said such action goes against the policy of the church. “The attention of His Lordship, Most Rev. Michael Gobal Gokum, the Catholic Bishop of Pankshin, has been drawn to a video in circulation by Rev. Fr. Kefas Gogwim, in which he prevented some Catholic worshippers from attending mass because they did not have their voter’s cards with them,” the statement reads. “The action of this priest did not have the approval of the Bishop, neither is it the policy of the diocese. “Hence, the Diocese disassociates itself from this video in circulation and regrets the unfortunate incident, much as parishioners are encouraged to obtain their PVCs to exercise their civic duties.”
