Two policemen were killed on Friday, following an attack by gunmen on the Makurdi-Lafia road in Benue state. Sewuese Anene, Benue police spokesperson, confirmed the development to journalists on Friday in Makurdi, the state capital. “I received information that two policemen died in an operation on Makurdi-Lafia road, but I am yet to receive details” Anene said. According to NAN, a resident in Yelwata, Guma LGA of the state, who didn’t want to be named, said the gunmen also stole the guns of the deceased officers.
