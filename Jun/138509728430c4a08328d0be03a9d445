The federal government has called on Nigerians to suspend the sale and consumption of bushmeat. According to NAN, Mohammad Abubakar, minister of agriculture and rural development, said this in a statement on Tuesday. He said following the report of 21 monkeypox cases and one death, the ministry through the department of veterinary and pest control services is actively collaborating with the Nigeria Centre for Disease Control (NCDC) and other stakeholders to ensure the situation is contained and brought under control. He said in in view of this, the ministry advises people to avoid contact with persons suspected to be infected with monkeypox at home and at workplaces. “Hunters and dealers of “bushmeat” must desist from the practice forthwith to prevent any possibility of “SPILLOVER” of the pathogen in Nigeria,” the statement reads. “Transport of wild animals and their products within and across the borders should be suspended/restricted. “All operators of Zoos, Parks, Conservation and Recreational centers keeping non-human primates in their domains must ensure strict compliance with their biosecurity protocols aimed at preventing their contacts with humans. “All Veterinary Clinics, Veterinary Teaching Hospitals and other Veterinary Health Institutions across the country must ensure vigilance so as to be able to pick possible signs and symptoms of Monkey Pox in non-human primate (NHP) patients. “We must also ensure regular handwashing using strong disinfectant anytime we handle NHP and rodents in our various locations. “We must also discourage the act of consumption, trade and keeping of NHP as well as rodents as pets in our homes.” Abubakar also advised the public to report any pox-like lesions seen on humans or animals to the nearest human or veterinary clinics respectively.
