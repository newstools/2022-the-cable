The Nigeria Police Force (NPF) says its operatives have arrested four suspects for disrupting the election at a polling unit in Ekiti state. The Ekiti governorship election is being rounded off in the state. In a statement on Saturday, the police said the suspects were arrested in Ado-Ekiti, the Ekiti capital. “They are being interrogated by the Police to establish their offence and involvement in line with extant laws. The collation process is ongoing and shall be concluded in due course,” the statement reads. “Operatives are attached to collation centres to ensure a smooth, free, fair, and credible collation process.” Earlier on Saturday, Kemi Elebute-Halle, governorship candidate of the Action Democratic Party (ADP) in Ekiti, had alleged that other political parties were inducing voters with money in the ongoing election. “At my polling unit here — ward 10, unit eight — we are aware that APC has started buying votes for the sum of N10,000; PDP are buying for N5,000 and SDP for N3,000,” Elebute-Halle said. Also, Segun Oni, SDP governorship candidate, said he received reports of vote buying in Oye LGA of the state. Meanwhile, the Economic and Financial Crimes Commission (EFCC) arrested some suspects for engaging in vote buying in the ongoing election. Some of the suspects were paraded at the Oke Ori Omi police division.
