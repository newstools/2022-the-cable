Peter Umeadi, a former chief judge of Anambra state, has been elected as the presidential candidate of the All Progressives Grand Alliance (APGA). He was declared the winner of the primary election which was held on Wednesday. Umeadi was unopposed in the primary as his candidacy was affirmed by 150 delegates at a special convention of the party in the Katampe area of Abuja. He retired as chief judge on March 1, 2019, and subsequently joined the party in his ward in the Anaocha area of Anambra. In April, while canvassing for the ticket of APGA, Umeadi described himself as the best candidate to win the 2023 presidential election for the party. Umeadi, who said it was time for a south-easterner to be elected president, noted that he has the capacity to reposition Nigeria in four years. “It is not possible for us to achieve economic, educational, scientific, sporting or sufficiency breakthrough when we are hungry, insecure and unstable,” he had said. “Nigerians are traumatised on daily basis from wanton killings. We know that insecurity, among other fall out have driven our people away from the farms, creating artificial scarcity of food and earning power. “Therefore, Nigeria requires change which only good leadership can provide. We need to change the way we think so we can change the way we do things. If I get the ticket of APGA, then, we stand a good chance to win the presidential election in 2023.” Umeadi said he would lead the country with “firmness and fairness” if he becomes president.
