Ahmed Idris, suspended accountant-general of the federation, has been released by the Economic and Financial Crimes Commission (EFCC). Idris was released on administrative bail on Wednesday night. Wilson Uwujaren, EFCC spokesperson, confirmed this to TheCable on Thursday. Idris was arrested in Kano state on May 16 by the anti-graft agency over an alleged N80 billion fraud. The EFCC said it is investigating the accountant-general over the alleged misappropriation of funds. The agency said it picked up Idris after he failed to respond to invitations by the commission to answer questions over the allegation. Consequently, he was suspended indefinitely by Zainab Ahmed, the minister of finance, budget and national planning. In a letter dated May 18, 2022, Ahmed said the suspension “without pay” was to allow for “proper and unhindered investigation” in line with public service rules. The EFCC on Sunday, arrested Abdulaziz Yari, former governor of Zamfara state, over his alleged involvement in the suspected fraud linked to the suspended accountant-general. The former governor was arrested over alleged fraud relating to the Subsidy Reinvestment and Empowerment Programme (SURE-P). A senior official of the commission who confirmed the development to TheCable said a N22 billion “SURE-P refund” was allegedly cooked up by the suspended accountant-general to move money to Yari. Arrested along with Yari is Anthony Yaro, chairman and managing director of Finex Professional, for their alleged role in the alleged N84 billion fraud involving Idris. Yari allegedly benefited to the tune of N22 billion through Finex Professional from the N84 billion which the former Idris allegedly paid one Akindele.
