The Catholic Diocese of Ondo has condemned the attack by gunmen on a church in Owo LGA. Gunmen attacked the St Francis Catholic Church in Owo while the Sunday service was nearing its conclusion. Many people were killed in the incident, including children and women. The gunmen were said to have detonated explosives before firing at the worshippers. In a statement on Sunday, Augustine Ikwu, the diocese’s director of social communications, said the attack happened on Pentecost Sunday “when every Catholic is expected to be in church to commemorate the solemnity”. He said the situation has left the community devastated. He, however, noted that “security agencies have been deployed to the community to relatively handle the situation”. “At this point in the history of our dear country Nigeria, we need God’s ultimate intervention to restore peace and tranquillity,” he said. Ikwu also clarified that contrary to social media reports, no priest was kidnapped. “All the priests and bishop in the parish are safe and non was kidnapped as the social media has it. Nonetheless, let us continue to pray for them and the good people of Owo and the state at large,” he said. “We turn to God to console the families of those whose lives were lost to this distressing incident, and we pray for the departed souls to rest in peace. Amen. “The bishop appeals that we remain calm, be law-abiding and pray for peace and normalcy to return to our community, state and country.”
