The federal government says the decline in power generation in parts of the country is due to the partial shutdown of Oben gas plant. According to a statement on Saturday, Isa Sanusi, media spokesperson of the ministry of power, said the plant was shut down to address the repair of critical gas processing equipment. “The incidence, unfortunately, occurred at a time when other power plants on other gas sources are undergoing planned maintenance and capacity testing,” the statement reads. “We wish to notify the public that Seplat Energy Plc has mobilized equipment, material and personnel to site with a view to expediting the restoration of normal gas supply to the affected power plants. “We have been assured that the repair work would be concluded this weekend and normalcy will be restored.” While pleading with electricity consumers to endure the current situation, the government assured Nigerians that efforts are being made to improve power supply across the country. TheCable had reported that the national electricity grid suffered system collapse on three occasions in less than one month.
