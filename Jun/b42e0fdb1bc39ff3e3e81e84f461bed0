Open defecation remains a public health concern not only in Nigeria but also in Sub Sahara Africa and it is no news that without proper sanitation efforts in this area, waste from infected individuals can contaminate a community’s land and water, increasing the risk of infection for other individuals. Just before the walk began, Mr. Richard Aloye, NYSC official representing, Apapa Local Government addressed the youth corps members who have now become Volunteers of the Hypo Toilet Cleaner brand and its toilet rescue initiative. He applauded their bravery and willingness to join the campaign to stand up against the use of Unsafe toilets and Open defecation in Nigeria. One of the major highlights was the surprise appearance of Jpaul- BBNaija Reality TV Star and the famous Nollywood actor Charles Inojie to excite the crowd just before the walk, the moment they came into view, the place was literally razed down in ecstatic uproar. Speaking at the sensitization walk, the Brand Manager, Hypo Toilet Cleaner, Mr. Chidera Anele while appreciating the stakeholders for their support said, the campaign was aimed at mobilizing high level support and resources towards building a new culture of safe defecation. <img class="alignnone wp-image-715275" src="https://f5p3e9e4.stackpathcdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/hypo3.jpg" alt="" width="550" height="364" srcset="https://f5p3e9e4.stackpathcdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/hypo3.jpg 1232w, https://f5p3e9e4.stackpathcdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/hypo3-300x199.jpg 300w, https://f5p3e9e4.stackpathcdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/hypo3-1024x678.jpg 1024w, https://f5p3e9e4.stackpathcdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/hypo3-768x509.jpg 768w, https://f5p3e9e4.stackpathcdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/hypo3-24x16.jpg 24w, https://f5p3e9e4.stackpathcdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/hypo3-36x24.jpg 36w, https://f5p3e9e4.stackpathcdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/hypo3-48x32.jpg 48w" sizes="(max-width: 550px) 100vw, 550px" /> “It is the first-time the brand will be leading a walk of this magnitude and we are in awe at the level of turn out and participation by not only the Youth corps members, also the youth corps officials and government office representatives.
