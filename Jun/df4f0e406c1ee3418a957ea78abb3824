Thanks Olusegun Obasanjo for your kind words to PO.” A good validation from Baba OBJ…I am OBIdient https://t.co/fHyFboX4GG — fagene (@festusagene) June 16, 2022  Integrity is a scarce/missing attribute in the life of today's politicians, yet a man like PO possess it in abundant & anywhr belle face SM influencers wit dead conscience are marketing rogues to Nig's for 2023, God forbid bad tin.Thanks @Oolusegun_obj for ur kind words 2 PO. https://t.co/94SlQHQpme — Zaint Dave (@DaveZaint) June 16, 2022  Coming from Obj, there has to be something he'd seen #PeterObi2023 https://t.co/BdhXzks39U — Onyeka umelo (@umelolin) June 16, 2022  VERIFICATION An online search shows no credible media platform published the statement credited to the former president. When contacted by TheCable, Kehinde Akinyemi, Obasanjo’s spokesman, dismissed the claim, saying the former president did not utter such statement. He said Obasanjo does not operate any Twitter account and in fact, he does not have any social media account. VERDICT The social media post claiming Obasanjo endorsed Peter Obi is fake. The post emanated from a parody account.
