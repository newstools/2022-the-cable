Festus Keyamo, minister of state for labour and employment, has asked Kingsley Moghalu, a former deputy governor of the Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN), to join the All Progressives Congress (APC). The development comes hours after Moghalu’s resignation from the African Democratic Congress (ADC). The former CBN deputy governor, who lost the ADC presidential ticket to Dumebi Kachikwu, founder of Roots Television, had said his leaving the party was as a result of the poor conduct of the presidential primary. He had also accused the ADC of promoting corruption during the presidential primary, which held in Abeokuta, the Ogun capital. “As you are well aware, I have consistently resisted pressures to join the APC or the PDP precisely to avoid “cash-and-carry” politics. For me to remain a member of the ADC therefore, after what thousands of party members participated in at Abeokuta, would be to endorse political corruption of a most obscene order,” Moghalu wrote in his resignation letter addressed to the ADC chairman. In a tweet on the matter, via his official handle on Monday, Keyamo said the “so-called” third force political parties may be “worse off” than the popular ones if given the power to rule. “My own dear brother, @MoghaluKingsley, you’ve just seen that the so-called Third Force are just some untested Nigerians who may just be worse off. They’re not from the moon; they’re NIGERIANS. It’s all sound & fury & nothing more. Welcome to the REAL WORLD. Please, join us in APC,” he said.
