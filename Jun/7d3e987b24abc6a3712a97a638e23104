Bola Tinubu, former Lagos governor who is contesting the presidency, has advised Teslim Folarin, governorship candidate of the All Progressives Congress (APC) in Oyo, to bring back aggrieved members of the party if he wants to win the election. Adebayo Adelabu, a governorship hopeful in Oyo state, had, on My 29, resigned his membership of the APC after losing the party’s ticket to Folarin. Tinubu, who was in Ibadan on Thursday for a meeting with APC delegates in Oyo state, said the party must bridge the gap created by the primary. “You have to work, walk, even with torchlight and lantern to appeal to leaders, women, youths and aggrieved members so that we can win governorship in 2023,” he said. “After you have done that, I will come back to raise your hands and campaign for you to emerge victorious. You will first come and meet me in Abuja and I will also invite all warring party members to appeal to them on your behalf.” In his response, Folarin said he remained grateful for Tinubu’s support, adding that delegates in the state would vote for him during the presidential primary. Also preset during Tinubu’s visit to Oyo were Abdullahi Ganduje, governor of Kano; Babajide Sanwo-Olu, Lagos governor; and Kasim Shettima, former Borno governor.
