The Nigeria Centre for Disease Control (NCDC) says the ongoing cholera outbreak in Nigeria shows that resources needed to eliminate the disease are insufficient. Ifedayo Adetifa, NCDC director-general, said this on Wednesday at the review of the national strategic plan of action on cholera control (NSPACC), in Abuja. The NSPACC is organised by NCDC, in collaboration with the International Federation of the Red Cross and Red Crescent. Adetifa said it is concerning that while many countries have since eliminated cholera, Nigeria remains one of the countries where it is endemic. “With advancement in health and technology, Nigeria still has a long way to go as we experience cholera outbreaks annually,” NAN quoted him as saying. “Ongoing cholera outbreaks show that resources, whether actual or perceived, are insufficient in keeping this disease at bay. “While funding is crucial, it especially requires our political leaders’ commitment. It takes states knowing their outbreak and ensuring a state-specific response to address issues like safe water infrastructure.” Adetifa said that while eliminating cholera has been the aim of endemic countries, improving water and environmental safety is not an overnight task. “However, mobilised funding, efforts and collaborations have become more visible with national cholera plans,” he said. “These efforts must be monitored and evaluated, which is why we are here today. “In 2018, the national strategic plan of action for cholera control was developed with intervention areas from leadership and coordination to social mobilisation and oral cholera vaccine (OCV) interventions. “Today, four years later, with several devastating cholera outbreaks in between, the mission and vision remain the ambition to reduce cholera outbreaks.” According to NCDC data, there have been 79 suspected cases of cholera in 2022, with two deaths.
