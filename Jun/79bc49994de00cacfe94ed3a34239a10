Ovie Omo-Agege, deputy senate president and All Progressives Congress (APC) governorship candidate in Delta, says if elected as governor his administration will have “a human face”. Ima Niboro, director of communications and media, quoted Omo-Agege as saying this in a statement on Thursday. The governorship candidate was reacting to the reported increase in tuition fees of tertiary institutions owned by the Delta government. Omo-Agege said increasing tuition fees at this time is “callous”. “Some parents are living from hand to mouth, they struggle to send their children to school. Others are living in abject penury because of the refusal of Governor Ifeanyi Okowa to pay pensioners,” he said. “Increasing school fees at this time is not only callous but insensitive, especially when some students are training themselves. “They have resorted to begging and many who were offered admission failed to report for studies due to inability to pay the exorbitant school fees. “Without a doubt, public higher institutions in the state are populated by mostly children of low income earners, peasant farmers, petty traders, civil servants and senior citizens yet to receive their gratuities and pensions. “These institutions are the only hope of educating their children as they cannot cope with the outrageous fees in private higher institutions.”
