Kayode Fayemi, governor of Ekiti, says the federal government’s claim that the Islamic State West in African Province (ISWAP) is responsible for the attack on St Francis Catholic Church in Owo is speculative. On June 5, gunmen attacked the church in Owo, Ondo state, and killed over 40 worshippers. The gunmen were said to have detonated explosives in the church after which they proceeded to fire shots at the congregation. On June 9, days after the gruesome incident, Rauf Aregbesola, minister of interior, said the attack was orchestrated by ISWAP. He said the imprint of ISWAP was found on the scene of the attack, adding that the police would go after assailants and bring them to justice. But speaking on Sunrise Daily, a Channels Television programme, on Monday, Fayemi said the claim by the federal government is “purely speculative”. The governor said he has not seen any evidence that substantially links the terror group to the attack. He said south-west governors will do all in their capacity alongside security agencies to ensure such a fatal attack does not happen in the zone again. “As far as I’m concerned, the statement about ISWAP or Boko Haram or whatever other institutions are responsible for this is purely speculative at this stage,” he said. “I haven’t seen any evidence that concretely puts this in the corner of any of these rogue elements. “And really at this stage, it doesn’t matter, they have committed a heinous crime and demonstrate maximum capacity to cause damage to our people, our duty is to ensure that this does not occur again and we go after elements of this nature, whichever organisation they represent.” His statement comes days after Rotimi Akeredolu, governor of Ondo, where the attack happened, rejected the same claim by the federal government.
