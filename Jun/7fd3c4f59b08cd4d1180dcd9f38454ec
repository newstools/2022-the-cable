The Golden Eaglets of Nigeria have defeated the Young Stallions of Burkina Faso 2-1 to win the U-17 WAFU B championship. The final was played on Friday night at the Cape Coast Stadium in Ghana. The five-time world champions went ahead in the 22nd minute courtesy of Abubakar Abdullahi’s header from Emmanuel Michael’s cross into the box. Twelve minutes after his first goal, Abdullahi missed another opportunity to grab a second. In the 41st minute of play, the Young Stallions netted an equaliser through a header by Abdulramane Ouedraogo. Both sides went into the halftime break with a 1-1 scoreline. The Eaglets had a strong start after the break and restored their lead — through Abdullahi once again — just three minutes into the second half. He should have made it a hat-trick 12 minutes later but he fumbled a decent scoring opportunity. Courtesy of the victory, the Nduka Ugbad-led side were crowned champions of the 2022 WAFU Zone B U17 championship. Earlier, Ghana, the host nation, defeated Ivory Coast 3-2 at the end of a thrilling contest to win bronze at the tournament.
