The Ogun state police command says its operatives have arrested six members of a suspected cult group, who have been on its wanted list. The police said the suspects were allegedly involved in cult clashes that led to the death of at least four persons in Sagamu and its environs. Abimbola Oyeyemi, Ogun police spokesperson, in a statement on Sunday, identified the suspects as Rafiu Osokoya, Azeez Abiola, Ogunsanwo Waheed, Toheeb Ayodele, Kolawole Adegbenro, and Azeez Taiwo. Oyeyemi said the suspects were arrested while holding nocturnal meeting along the Ayepe/Odogbolu area of the state. “On interrogation, the suspects confessed belonging to the dreaded Eiye cult group who have been unleashing rain of terror in Shagamu since the beginning of this year,” the Ogun police spokesperson said. “They confessed to killing of one Animashaun in Shagamu and another person simply identified as Ekwe also in Sabo area of Shagamu. “They further confessed that their group was responsible for the death of one Adigun and Elewure both of whom were killed at Isote area of Shagamu early this year during one of their nefarious operations. “Meanwhile, the commissioner of police, CP Lanre Bankole, who commended the team for a well done job, has ordered a massive manhunt for the remaining members of the gang. “He also directed that the arrested suspects be arraigned in court as soon as possible.” <img class="aligncenter wp-image-714262" src="https://f5p3e9e4.stackpathcdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/IMG-20220619-WA0010-1024x512.jpg" alt="" width="550" height="275" srcset="https://f5p3e9e4.stackpathcdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/IMG-20220619-WA0010-1024x512.jpg 1024w, https://f5p3e9e4.stackpathcdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/IMG-20220619-WA0010-300x150.jpg 300w, https://f5p3e9e4.stackpathcdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/IMG-20220619-WA0010-768x384.jpg 768w, https://f5p3e9e4.stackpathcdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/IMG-20220619-WA0010-24x12.jpg 24w, https://f5p3e9e4.stackpathcdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/IMG-20220619-WA0010-36x18.jpg 36w, https://f5p3e9e4.stackpathcdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/IMG-20220619-WA0010-48x24.jpg 48w, https://f5p3e9e4.stackpathcdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/IMG-20220619-WA0010.jpg 1040w" sizes="(max-width: 550px) 100vw, 550px" /> <img class="aligncenter wp-image-714261" src="https://f5p3e9e4.stackpathcdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/IMG-20220619-WA0011-1024x637.jpg" alt="" width="550" height="342" srcset="https://f5p3e9e4.stackpathcdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/IMG-20220619-WA0011-1024x637.jpg 1024w, https://f5p3e9e4.stackpathcdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/IMG-20220619-WA0011-300x187.jpg 300w, https://f5p3e9e4.stackpathcdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/IMG-20220619-WA0011-768x478.jpg 768w, https://f5p3e9e4.stackpathcdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/IMG-20220619-WA0011-24x15.jpg 24w, https://f5p3e9e4.stackpathcdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/IMG-20220619-WA0011-36x22.jpg 36w, https://f5p3e9e4.stackpathcdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/IMG-20220619-WA0011-48x30.jpg 48w, https://f5p3e9e4.stackpathcdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/IMG-20220619-WA0011.jpg 1040w" sizes="(max-width: 550px) 100vw, 550px" />
