The United States mission to Nigeria has commended the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) on the improved functions of the bimodal voter accreditation system (BVAS) during the Ekiti governorship election. The Ekiti election held over the weekend, and Biodun Oyebanji of the All Progressives Congress (APC) was declared winner of the exercise. Oyebanji polled 187,057 votes to defeat his two closest challengers — Segun Oni of the Social Democratic Party (SDP), who got 82,211 votes, and Bisi Kolawole of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP), who got 67,457 votes. In a statement issued on Wednesday, the US said the exercise was largely peaceful, and urged Nigerians to be more active in political participation. “The United States Mission to Nigeria congratulates the citizens of Ekiti State on the largely peaceful conduct of the gubernatorial election on June 18,” the statement reads. “We commend the concerted efforts of INEC staff and security personnel which helped facilitate a secure election with a credible outcome. “We note the election’s technical improvements including that the newly adopted bi-modal verification accreditation system (BVAS) functioned properly in the vast majority of polling stations. “We encourage all citizens to register to vote as the country moves towards national elections.”
