Sunday Dare, minister of youth and sports development, has hailed the performance of Team Nigeria at the African Athletics Championships in Mauritius. Team Nigeria won five gold, three silver, and three bronze medals to finish third on the medal table — just behind Kenya and South Africa at the tournament. The country’s feat comes despite the absence of some of its top-rated athletes. In a statement on Sunday, Dare commended the team for showing strength in depth in track and field events. According to him, the athletes’ performance underscored the positive attitude of Nigerian sportsmen and women as well as the fighting spirit that makes them succeed against all odds. “Even in the absence of some of our top rated athletes who could not make it to Mauritius, Team Nigeria still fought gallantly and defended our colours brilliantly. We are so proud of the athletes,” he said. The tournament, which started on June 8, came to an end on Sunday. Tobi Amusan had clinched Nigeria’s first gold medal at the championship. The 25-year-old dipped 12.57 seconds in the women 100 meters hurdles to retain the title she won four years ago.
