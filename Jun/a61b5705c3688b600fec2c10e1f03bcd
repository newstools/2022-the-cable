The Nigerian Railway Corporation (NRC) has warned against a fictitious website inviting citizens to participate in a quiz that attracts monetary benefit. Yakub Mahmood, deputy director, public relations department, NRC, said this in a statement issued on Saturday in Lagos. NRC said the purported online platform has no credible source. “This website with the link http://installmultilateral.top/nrcgovng/tb.php is completely a scam website,” the statement reads. “This stock in trade is to defraud innocent people and tarnish the reputable corporate image of the organisation. “NRC hereby refutes that the fake website publication, orchestrated by scammers and fraudsters is to defraud unsuspecting members of the public as there is no question-and-answer quiz been conducted online by the NRC.” NRC further advised the general public to be wary, conscious and observant in order not to fall prey to “unscrupulous internet fraudsters masquerading with fictitious websites”.
