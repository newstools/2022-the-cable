Ovie Omo-Agege, deputy senate president, has praised Ejiro Otarigho, a driver who drove a burning tanker away from a community in Delta state. At the weekend, Otarigho was seen driving a tanker on fire in Agbarho community in Delta. Speaking with the driver over telephone, Omo-Agege, All Progressives Congress (APC) Delta governorship candidate, described Otarigho as a “hero”. The senator said if not for the driver’s courage, a major fire disaster would have occured in the community that would have claimed lives and property. “By your action, you have saved a lot of our people who could have died from this accident. It is not everyone that will have the courage to do what you just did,” Ima Niboro, Omo-Agege’s campaign spokesman, quoted him as saying. “By this singular act, you saved the Agbarho community from a major disaster. And we are very proud of you. “To me, you have become a hero to our people. And I’m sure a lot of people will be looking up to you right now. So you have every right to feel like a hero. I am very proud of you.” On his part, Otarigho was quoted as saying Omo-Agege’s call to him shows he identifies with the people. “For a man like the deputy senate president to call me at this crucial time, I am very happy about that. Hearing from him alone shows that he identifies with the people,” he said. “People have been complaining that nobody cares. That if I’d allowed people to die they would have been coming to see the dead. “But now I am very happy that the deputy president of the Senate could speak to me.” Watch video below.
