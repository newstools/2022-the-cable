The federal government has declared Monday as public holiday in commemoration of Democracy Day. Democracy Day is celebrated on June 12. Rauf Aregbesola, minister of interior, announced the development in a statement issued on Thursday by Shuaib Belgore, permanent secretary in the ministry. The minister urged Nigerians to use the period for reflection on the country’s past experiences, and also work towards promoting unity in the interest of sustainable democratic values. “As we mark another Democracy Day in the history of our dear country, let us reflect on the efforts of our founding fathers and ensure that Nigeria remains one united, secured, peaceful and an indivisible entity, noting that no development can take place in an acrimonious environment,” Aregbesola was quoted as saying. “With the challenges we face in Nigeria today, I see an opportunity for us not to break up or break down, but to break open; open up to ourselves in truth so that we may appreciate each other, understand each other, honour each other and live together in peace and prosperity.” He urged Nigerians to take advantage of the recently-launched Nigeria internal security and public safety alert system (N-Alert) mobile application, “designed to mitigate security challenges and other disasters with the slogan ‘See Something Do N-Alert'”. Aregbesola also assured Nigerians that the President Muhammadu Buhari-led administration remains committed to improving security and “stabilising” the economy.
