Voters in Ikere LGA of Ekiti state have complained of a lack of stamp pads in the election materials provided for the area. The voters also alleged that the exercise has been compromised. In separate interviews with NAN, some voters in the LGA expressed their dissatisfaction over the lack of stamp pads. Caroline, an 85-year-old woman, said no matter how long it takes, she would wait until the stamp pads are provided. “This is my civic responsibility, and that I am still alive to witness this, I must cast my vote,” she said. “This is another dimension in my 85 year in life; I have voted more than 12 times and never witnessed this situation. “But, no matter how long it takes INEC to produce the stamp pads, I will continue to wait.” Isaac Alabi, another voter, said it was three days to the election that the INEC officials noticed that stamp pads were missing in the materials given to them. Ade Asimolowo, a voter, said a peaceful election is possible, if all involved in the process abide by the rules. According to NAN as of 10:15 am, at Ugele Arokun Ward 3, Unit 6 in Ikere-Ekiti, where the ADC candidate was expected to vote, stamp pads were missing in the voting materials dispatched to the polling unit. Wole Oluyede, governorship candidate of the Action Democratic Congress (ADC), said the election had been compromised owing to the absence of vitals items in the election materials sent to the LGA. Festus More, a presiding officer, said at the time he checked, all the materials were complete, and that he did not know when the stamp pads were removed. “I was set for the voting as all the necessary preparation and protocols have been done. In fact, I have given out a ballot paper to the first voter, only to discover that the stamps were missing,” More said. He assured voters that plans are in place to get new sets of stamp pads for voting to commence.
