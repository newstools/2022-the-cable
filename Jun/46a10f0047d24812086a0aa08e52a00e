The Promoters of One Nigeria Group (PRONIG), a civil society organisation (CSO), has called on security agencies to intensify efforts to tackle crime in the country. The group said this in a statement issued on Monday, in reaction to the recent attack on St. Francis Catholic Church in Owo. Edache Tega, president of the group, expressed concern over the security challenges in the country. “The spate of insecurity in the country has assumed a dangerous dimension, and this call for sober reflection,” he said. “The human life holds no value anymore with the turn of events, especially the attack on innocent worshipers in Owo, Ondo State. “The recent massacre in Owo, Ondo State, is such that only enemies of Nigeria and Nigerians can perpetuate. These are indeed trying times for our great country. “We do not need a soothsayer to remind us of the collective resolve to ensure that Nigeria does not fail. “As a group devoted to promoting the ideals of one Nigeria, we call on our security agencies to double efforts towards addressing the internal security challenges across the country. “No religion or ethnicity encourages crime. Crime is a social vice perpetuated by unscrupulous elements; as such, we should be careful not to give acts of criminality religious or ethnic colouration. “We must condemn these acts of savagery in one strong voice as Nigerians and therefore call on law enforcement and other relevant agencies to work in synergy towards apprehending the perpetrators of the wicked act and ensure that the course of justice runs its entire course in this matter.”
