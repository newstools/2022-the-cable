Hope Uzodimma, governor of Imo, has asked bandits operating in the state’s forests to surrender within 10 days and receive an unconditional pardon. He said the gunmen will “face bombardment” if they fail to take advantage of the window of opportunity. Uzodimma said this on Sunday in a statement signed by Oguwike Nwachuku, his chief press secretary and media adviser. The governor warned that the 10-day amnesty takes off with immediate effect, adding that there will be severe consequences if treated with levity. Uzodimma said the state government has procured the necessary equipment and recruited more Ebube-Agu personnel to combat insecurity. He said the equipment will be delivered on Monday, June 27. “The state is more determined now than before to clear all bandits and to achieve this, the expected equipment and additional recruitment of more Ebube-Agu personnel working in collaboration with the security agencies in the state will be used to clear all the waterways and ride the state of bandits including crude-oil theft,” he said. “All the waterways are under surveillance with the delivery of new naval equipment to the naval base in Oguta.” Uzodimma added that the amnesty window will not be extended.
