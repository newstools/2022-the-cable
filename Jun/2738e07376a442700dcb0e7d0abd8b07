The League Management Company (LMC) has refuted claims that the Nigeria Professional Football League (NPFL) match between Katsina United and Remo Stars was played for another 30 minutes after the normal time. On Sunday, there were rumours on social media that the matchday 35 fixture played at the Muhammadu Dikko Stadium in Katsina witnessed a goal scored in the 34th minute of additional time. According to the rumours, the match officials added over half an hour to the game after the conclusion of the regular 90 minutes, thereby helping the home team to nick the match 3-2 for vital points. The development had triggered a chorus of condemnation on social media platforms with many Nigerians criticising the league and its organisers. But in a chat with TheCable on Monday, Salihu Abubakar, LMC’s chief operating officer (COO), said the rumours are “reports of sensationalism.” According to him, the game was halted after Remo scored the equaliser in the 92nd minute, and “the home team went to challenge the assistant referee.” He said the pause lasted for “like 20 minutes before they restored normalcy.” “It was 2-1 then Remo Stars equalised. So there was a problem as the home team went to challenge the assistant referee. And it took a long time, like 20 minutes before they restored normalcy,” the LMC COO told TheCable. “So it’s not that the match was going on for 30 plus minutes after normal time but there was disruption so they had to calm everything down before playing the remaining five minutes. And within those five minutes, Kastina scored their goal. “People just sensationalise. Even when the pitch was cleared they still had to make sure that everything is back to normal before the resumption of the game. This all took time. But most people monitor the game on score-tracking websites and thought that the game was being played.”
