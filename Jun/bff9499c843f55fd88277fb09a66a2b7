The senate has resolved to probe allegations of corruption and abuse of office levelled against Tanko Muhammad, immediate past chief justice of Nigeria (CJN). On Monday, Muhammad resigned from office on grounds of ill health. Before then, some justices of the supreme court accused the former CJN of gross misconduct and not paying attention to the welfare of judicial officers. The decision of the upper legislative chamber to probe the allegations against Muhammad followed a motion sponsored by Opeyemi Bamidele, chairman of the senate committee on judiciary. While moving his motion on Tuesday, Bamidele said there is a need to preserve the “sacred image” of the judiciary. “Justices are taciturn and reticent in handling issues outside their judicial domain, but resorting to such measures in order to protect the judiciary, requires the senate to rise up to the occasion to ensure that their demands are addressed,” he said. He also said it is regrettable that Muhammad “voluntarily resigned his appointment on grounds of ill-health, leaving the most senior justice to act as the acting chief justice of Nigeria”. “However, this development will not prevent the committee from going ahead with its assignment in the quest to find a probable lasting solution to the matter,” Bamidele added.
