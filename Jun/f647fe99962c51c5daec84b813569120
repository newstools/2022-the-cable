The troops of Operation Hadin Kai and the civilian joint task force have reportedly killed 47 insurgents in Borno state. The combined troops, supported by the 21 army armoured brigade, Bama, invaded the camps of the insurgents in Gazuwa village in Bama LGA on Sunday. The camps, which were renamed by the insurgents as “Gazuwa” (headquarters), housed Boko Haram fighters and their families from the Abubakar Shekau faction. The troops reportedly engaged the insurgents in a gun duel that lasted hours, killing 47 of them. However, two members of the civilian joint task force were killed during the operation. Also on June 13, the troops reportedly destroyed over 700 makeshift houses and shelters of the insurgents and recovered several motorcycles and weapons from them. Two of the insurgents, who were captured, reportedly confessed that the camp was led by top commanders loyal to one Abu Ikilima. The insurgents reportedly said during the clearance operation, three Boko Haram governors, three commanding officers, and one commander were killed.
