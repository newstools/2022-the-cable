Gunmen have killed Vitus Borogo, the chaplain of the Catholic Church in Kaduna Polytechnic. Borogo was killed on Saturday at the Prison Farm, Kujama, along Kaduna-Kachia road. Christian Okewu Emmanuel, the church’s chancellor, in a statement on Saturday, said Borogo was killed when “terrorists” invaded the farm. “It is with a heavy heart, but with total submission to the will of God that we announce the death of Rev. Fr. Vitus Borogo, which sad event took place today, at Prison Farm, Kujama, along Kaduna-Kachia Road, after a raid on the farm by Terrorists,” the statement reads. “Until his death, Fr Vitus (aged 50) was the Chaplain of the Catholic Community of the Kaduna State Polytechnic, and the Chairman of the Nigerian Catholic Diocesan Priests Association (NCDPA), Kaduna Chapter. “Most Rev. Matthew Man-Oso Ndagoso, the Catholic Archbishop of Kaduna condoles with the immediate family, the NFCS Family of Kaduna Polytechnic, and indeed the entire Kaduna Polytechnic Community; and assures them of his fraternal closeness and prayers. “Details of his Funeral arrangement will be announced as soon as possible. Meanwhile we commit his soul to the maternal intercession of the Blessed Virgin Mary, and call on all men and women of goodwill to continue to pray for the peaceful repose of his soul and for the consolation of his bereaved family, especially his mother.” Over the past few weeks, clerics in Kaduna have come under attack, with a number of them getting abducted. A week ago, three persons were killed following an attack by gunmen on two churches in the state.
