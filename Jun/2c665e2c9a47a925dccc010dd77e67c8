President Muhammadu Buhari will address the country at 7am on Sunday. According to a statement issued on Saturday by Femi Adesina, presidential spokesman, the address will form part of activities for the Democracy Day celebration. “President Muhammadu Buhari will broadcast to the nation on Sunday, June 12, 2022, at 7am as part of activities to commemorate Nigeria’s Democracy Day,” the statement reads. “Television, radio stations, and other electronic media outlets are enjoined to hook up to the network services of the Nigerian Television Authority and Radio Nigeria for the broadcast.” Buhari had, in June 2018, declared June 12 as the new date for Democracy Day. “For the past 18 years, Nigerians have been celebrating May 29th, as Democracy Day. That was the date when for the second time in our history, an elected civilian administration took over from a military government. The first time this happened was on October 21st, 1979,” the president said in a statement on June 6, 2018. “But in the view of Nigerians, as shared by this administration, June 12th, 1993, was far more symbolic of Democracy in the Nigerian context than May 29th or even October 1st. “June 12th, 1993 was the day when Nigerians in millions expressed their democratic will in what was undisputedly the freest, fairest and most peaceful elections since our Independence. The fact that the outcome of that election was not upheld by the then military government does not distract from the democratic credentials of that process. “Accordingly, after due consultations, the federal government has decided that henceforth, June 12th will be celebrated as Democracy Day.”
