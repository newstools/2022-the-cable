A book detailing the “interests and intrigues” that shaped the deliberations and outcome of the 2014 national conference, will be launched on June 28, 2022. The 633-page book, titled ‘The National Conversation: Interests and Intrigues that Shaped the 2014 National Conference’, was authored by two media professionals, Akpandem James and Sam Akpe. According to a statement issued on Wednesday, the event is billed to hold at NICON Luxury Hotel, Abuja, and will be chaired by Goodluck Jonathan, former president. Anyim Pius Anyim, former secretary to the government of the federation; Mahmood Yakubu, INEC chairman; Akilu Indabawa, who was in charge of the national conference proceedings, as well as politicians, journalists, business leaders, scholars and heads of development agencies, are also expected to be present at the book unveiling. According to the statement, the 2014 conference “was a fundamental step towards addressing weighty national issues that have been canvassed over the years by the different stakeholders in the country”. “Therefore, it was an important national project aimed at realistically examining and genuinely resolving long standing hurdles to national cohesion and inclusive development of the country,” the statement reads. The book “distils some of the highlights of the conference proceedings, the trajectory of events, including moves that led to some of the very critical decisions, major contributions by delegates, the contentions, as well as other issues that are not in the public domain”. Bolaji Akinyemi, former minister of external affairs who was deputy chairman of the national conference, wrote the foreword. Also, a review of the book will be done at the event by Philip Afaha, director, Institute of Legislative Studies.
