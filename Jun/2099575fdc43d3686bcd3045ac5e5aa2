Rochas Okorocha, serving senator and presidential hopeful, was able to appear before the All Progressives Congress (APC) panel screening presidential hopefuls on the party’s platform. Okorocha appeared before the APC panel on Tuesday night after perfecting his bail conditions. On May 24, the senator was arrested by the Economic and Financial Crimes Commission (EFCC) over alleged fraud. He was arraigned on a 17-count charge of money laundering at a federal high court in Abuja on Monday. The former governor of Imo state pleaded “not guilty”. Inyang Ekwo, the judge handling the case, granted him bail in the sum of N500 million and a surety in like sum. Okorocha was able to make the screening exercise a few hours to the end of the panel’s work which was to last for only two days. Speaking with journalists after the exercise, Okorocha said he told the panel that he is in the presidential race because of his love and passion for Nigeria. “The panel was quite interesting, I was able to explain to the panel I’m in this whole thing because of my love and passion for this nation,” he said. “I think I understand the problem of this country and find a solution. Seek ye first wealth creation in this nation and every other thing shall be added unto you. “Let us stop singing the songs of statistics for our inflation rate, it will not stop the unemployment rate. I have come into this business (presidential race) because of my vision not ambition.”
