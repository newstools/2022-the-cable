This vision further drives its mission to preserve the full range of Nigeria’s biodiversity; promote the sustainable use of natural resources for the benefit of present and future generations; and advocate actions that minimise pollution and wasteful utilisation of renewable resources. For Responsib’All Day, they provided expertise in choosing the various seedlings needed at the various locations; and will be accountable for monitoring the maintenance of the trees. <img class="alignnone wp-image-717827" src="https://f5p3e9e4.stackpathcdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/Screen-Shot-2022-06-28-at-5.03.40-PM.png" alt="" width="550" height="366" srcset="https://f5p3e9e4.stackpathcdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/Screen-Shot-2022-06-28-at-5.03.40-PM.png 1056w, https://f5p3e9e4.stackpathcdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/Screen-Shot-2022-06-28-at-5.03.40-PM-300x200.png 300w, https://f5p3e9e4.stackpathcdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/Screen-Shot-2022-06-28-at-5.03.40-PM-1024x682.png 1024w, https://f5p3e9e4.stackpathcdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/Screen-Shot-2022-06-28-at-5.03.40-PM-768x511.png 768w, https://f5p3e9e4.stackpathcdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/Screen-Shot-2022-06-28-at-5.03.40-PM-24x16.png 24w, https://f5p3e9e4.stackpathcdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/Screen-Shot-2022-06-28-at-5.03.40-PM-36x24.png 36w, https://f5p3e9e4.stackpathcdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/Screen-Shot-2022-06-28-at-5.03.40-PM-48x32.png 48w" sizes="(max-width: 550px) 100vw, 550px" /> “Conservation projects that help to sustain our communities like that of the Responsib’All Day, is essential for societal progress”, said Uchenna Achunine, Director, Business Development & Communications at the Nigerian Conservation Foundation. “Pernod Ricard Nigeria’s commitment to strengthening the well-being of our communities and the world at large, is truly inspirational and we are proud to boldly support and celebrate their efforts.” <img class="alignnone wp-image-717830" src="https://f5p3e9e4.stackpathcdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/Screen-Shot-2022-06-28-at-5.03.05-PM.png" alt="" width="550" height="363" srcset="https://f5p3e9e4.stackpathcdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/Screen-Shot-2022-06-28-at-5.03.05-PM.png 1058w, https://f5p3e9e4.stackpathcdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/Screen-Shot-2022-06-28-at-5.03.05-PM-300x198.png 300w, https://f5p3e9e4.stackpathcdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/Screen-Shot-2022-06-28-at-5.03.05-PM-1024x677.png 1024w, https://f5p3e9e4.stackpathcdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/Screen-Shot-2022-06-28-at-5.03.05-PM-768x507.png 768w, https://f5p3e9e4.stackpathcdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/Screen-Shot-2022-06-28-at-5.03.05-PM-24x16.png 24w, https://f5p3e9e4.stackpathcdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/Screen-Shot-2022-06-28-at-5.03.05-PM-36x24.png 36w, https://f5p3e9e4.stackpathcdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/Screen-Shot-2022-06-28-at-5.03.05-PM-48x32.png 48w" sizes="(max-width: 550px) 100vw, 550px" /> The Responsib’All Day is being commemorated by Pernod Ricard employees globally and is a strong reflection of the Pernod Ricard Group’s long-term commitment to sustainability and responsibility. Most recently in Nigeria, the company implemented its Safe Roads Campaign during the Christmas and Easter celebrations in partnership with Federal Road Safety Corps (FRSC). The initiative featured engagements with commercial drivers who were educated on the dangers of drinking and driving as well as other risks associated with irresponsible alcohol consumption and its effects to the society at large. In addition to this, the company also launched its Drink More Water campaign in 2021 – a digital campaign aimed at encouraging young adults to consume more water to reduce binge drinking – which has continued to impact the lives of people across Nigeria. <img class="alignnone wp-image-717831" src="https://f5p3e9e4.stackpathcdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/Screen-Shot-2022-06-28-at-5.02.49-PM.png" alt="" width="550" height="366" srcset="https://f5p3e9e4.stackpathcdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/Screen-Shot-2022-06-28-at-5.02.49-PM.png 1058w, https://f5p3e9e4.stackpathcdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/Screen-Shot-2022-06-28-at-5.02.49-PM-300x200.png 300w, https://f5p3e9e4.stackpathcdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/Screen-Shot-2022-06-28-at-5.02.49-PM-1024x682.png 1024w, https://f5p3e9e4.stackpathcdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/Screen-Shot-2022-06-28-at-5.02.49-PM-768x512.png 768w, https://f5p3e9e4.stackpathcdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/Screen-Shot-2022-06-28-at-5.02.49-PM-24x16.png 24w, https://f5p3e9e4.stackpathcdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/Screen-Shot-2022-06-28-at-5.02.49-PM-36x24.png 36w, https://f5p3e9e4.stackpathcdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/Screen-Shot-2022-06-28-at-5.02.49-PM-48x32.png 48w" sizes="(max-width: 550px) 100vw, 550px" /> About Pernod Ricard Nigeria Pernod Ricard Nigeria is the local affiliate of Pernod Ricard, a global leader in wines and spirits.
