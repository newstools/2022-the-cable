Nigeria’s women’s cricket team on Friday made it two wins out of two, beating Germany in the first-ever meeting between both countries. The Female Yellow-Greens defeated Brazil on Thursday at the 7th Kwibuka T20 international women’s tournament held in Kigali, Rwanda. Nigeria won the toss on Friday and put the European side to bat, a move that supported the belief in their bowling attack and ability to chase down a score as accented to by Uyi Akpata, president of the Nigeria Cricket Federation, who ties it to the federation’s investment in the team. “I am particularly happy at the performance of our players. They had a little hitch here and there but you must admit that this team has improved from what we saw earlier in March in Lagos and they are getting better with every game,” Akpata said. Teenagers Lilian Ude and Rukayat Abdulrasaq took the new ball for Nigeria and bowled beautifully but it was Rachael Samson with 4 wickets for 13 runs from her 4 overs who did real damage. Christina Gough 22(49) and Sharanya Sadarangani 22(30) were the only ones to put up any real resistance. In their reply, the Nigerians were expected to make light work of the total but their innings got off to a shaky start, losing Kehinde Abdulquadri and Agatha Obulor cheaply before the pair of Esther Sandy and Salome Sunday 32(40) took the game away from the Germans. There was a mini-collapse towards the end after Sunday lost her wicket in what could be described as a rush of blood but Abigail Igbobie and Favour Eseigbe made sure of victory. The latest win moves Nigeria to the top of the standings along with Kenya as the team with a 100 percent record so far. Host Rwanda got its first win at the event, edging Brazil with a 35-run victory after losing to Kenya by six-wicket in the opening game. Nigeria faces Botswana on Saturday, hoping for a third win to remain top of the table and have a better chance at the Kigali 2022 honours.
