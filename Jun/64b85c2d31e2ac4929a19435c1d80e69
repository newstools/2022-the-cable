The National Pension Commission (PenCom) says verification and enrolment exercise for retirees and prospective retirees of federal government treasury-funded ministries, departments and agencies (MDAs) will commence on June 20. The commission made the announcement in a statement issued on Thursday. PenCom said the exercise would end August 31. The commission said the group of retirees eligible for the online verification and enrolment exercise include employees of FG treasury-funded MDAs scheduled to retire in 2022 and employees of FG treasury-funded MDAs that missed the enrolment exercises in previous years. It directed all retirees and prospective retirees to visit their pension fund administrators (PFAs) and undergo the data recapture exercise. “This entails retirees/prospective retirees providing their personal details including their National Identity Number (NIN),” PenCom said. The commission added that retirees — as well as prospective retirees who had undergone the data recapture exercise earlier — are not required to repeat it. For the enrolment, self-assisted retirees/prospective retirees are required to visit PenCom’s website, and upload their employment details and scanned copies of required documents before proceeding to their respective PFAs for physical verification and enrolment. PenCom said the step-by-step procedure for the online enrolment is available on its website. “Pension Desk Officer/PFA-Assisted Retirees/prospective retirees who are unable to complete the online registration for any reason could approach the Pension Desk Officer of their respective MDAs or visit their PFAs for assistance,” it added.
