Mahmood Yakubu, chairman of the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC), says an extension of the deadline for voter registration may be considered. Yakubu spoke on Saturday at an event tagged ‘Youth Vote Count 2.0 Mega Concert’, organised by YIAGA Africa, a civil society organisation, in partnership with the European Union and INEC. “We have heard your requests loud and clear. You will soon hear from us on extension of CVR registration,” Yakubu said. “Please assure me that you will register, pick your PVCs and vote. I also assure you that your votes will count.” The commission had said it would suspend the online voter pre-registration exercise on May 30, while the online pre-registration and physical registration will subsist simultaneously until the CVR exercise is suspended on June 30, 2022. YIAGA Africa had, in an earlier statement, called for an extension of the voter registration exercise on the grounds that many Nigerians are yet to get their PVCs. “Yiaga Africa commends INEC for responding to citizens’ demands by deploying additional enrollment devices to manage the high turnout of intending registrants in some states like Lagos, Kano and the five states in the south-east,” the statement reads. “However, we note with concern reports alleging denial of the rights of citizens to register and disruptions of CVR in some locations. “Yiaga Africa urges INEC to investigate these reports and ensure the constitutional right of citizens to register to vote is protected.” The CSO also recommended that INEC extends the June 30 deadline by three weeks. According to the organisation, an extension will give INEC the opportunity to handle the high volume of applications for registration.
