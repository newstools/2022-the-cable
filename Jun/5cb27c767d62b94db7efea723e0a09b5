Ambrose Ogbu, traditional ruler of Isu community in Onicha LGA of Ebonyi, has been kidnapped by gunmen. Chris Anyanwu, police spokesman in the state, confirmed the incident to NAN on Thursday. Ogbu was said to have been kidnapped from his palace on Wednesday. “Yes, we are aware of the abduction of the traditional ruler,” the Ebonyi police spokesman said. “It happened in Isu, Onicha. The fact now is that we are yet to get the full details.” According to NAN, a family source who preferred anonymity, said Ogbu was kidnapped alongside his gateman between 8pm and 9pm on Wednesday. “He was kidnapped in his palace. The kidnappers came with motorcycles in their numbers and ordered the gateman to call the chief out,” NAN quoted the source as saying. “As chief was coming out, the kidnappers collected his Hyundai SUV car key and immediately forced him into the car and drove away. “Right now, no contact has been established with the family. We pray he returns alive.” The incident comes amid an increase in reports of abductions across the country in recent times. On Sunday, Aminu Derwan, the district head of Panyam, Mantu LGA of Plateau, was abducted by gunmen. The gunmen, reportedly numbering about 20, invaded the community, fired shots into the air to scare locals, before taking him away.
