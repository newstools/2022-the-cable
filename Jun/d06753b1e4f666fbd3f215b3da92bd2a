The federal ministry of youth and sports development says it is proposing a wholesale change to the mobilisation processes for fresh graduates called up for the National Youth Service Corps (NYSC) scheme. On Sunday, TheCable learnt that there have been a series of complaints and petitions that the current mobilisation processes have become too cumbersome and difficult, putting graduates eligible for the national service at great odds. Accordingly, the orientation camping logistics would also be reviewed because of the bureaucratic challenges that have rendered most of its operations ineffective. “We are proposing to have a more user-friendly process that will checkmate exposures, delays, abuses and protect our young graduates from some of the unnecessary processes they are being subjected to,” read a statement from the ministry sighted by TheCable. “These young ones are eager to be part of the scheme and want to serve Nigeria so we will ensure that the processes are modified to encourage and not discourage them, like having prospective youth corps members subjected to drug tests.” In December 2021, Sunday Dare, minister of youth development, advocated for the drafting of corps members in the fight against drug abuse in Nigeria. Buba Marwa, chairman of the National Drug Law Enforcement Agency (NDLEA), had recently appealed that drug tests should be made compulsory for corps members across the country.
