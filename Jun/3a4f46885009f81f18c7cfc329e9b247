Governors of the All Progressives Congress (APC) have recommended five presidential hopefuls for the party’s primary election scheduled to take place today. The decision is reportedly backed by members of the party’s national working committee (NWC). Simon Lalong, governor of Plateau, disclosed this on Tuesday when he featured on Sunrise Daily, a Channels TV programme. Lalong said those the governors and NWC members recommended to contest are Rotimi Amaechi, former minister of transportation; Bola Tinubu, former Lagos governor; Kayode Fayemi, Ekiti state governor; David Umahi, governor of Ebonyi, and Vice-President Yemi Osinbajo. He said all other presidential hopefuls have been advised to step down, adding that the “frontline candidates” recommended by the governors have the endorsement of President Muhammadu Buhari. “The president told us any of these five are qualified to be president and have contributed to the party (APC). He said he is comfortable with any of them,” he said. “Our recommendation is to enable us to give direction for the party as we go into the primary. We cannot go with everybody, but in our view, these are the people we think should remain.” “The screening committee submitted a report. All the contestants were graded even though none of them was disqualified.” But he said other hopefuls not satisfied with the decision can still contest.
