Nicolas Felix, a presidential hopeful under the All Progressives Congress (APC), has condemned the attack on a church in Owo, Ondo state. On Sunday, St. Francis Catholic Church in Owo was attacked by gunmen while mass was in progress. Many — including women and children — were killed in the attack. In a statement on Tuesday, Nicolas, a US-based Nigerian pastor of the Miracle Church International, described the attack as an affront on the church of Christ. The 40-year-old presidential hopeful called on security agencies to apprehend the perpetrators of the attack and bring them to justice. “It was with a rude shock I received the news of the killing of innocent and harmless worshippers at the St Francis Catholic Church at Owooluwa street, Owo, Ondo state,” Nicolas said. “It is barbaric and ungodly and such gruesome act should have no place in our society or any society for that matter! The attack is not just barbaric but an affront on the church of Christ, and we stand in solidarity with the Ondo people at this trying time. “This attack marks a worrying escalation of violence in Nigeria and no cause can justify such brutality and senseless killings. “I strongly condemn this dastardly act and call on every security agency in the country to combine efforts in fishing out the perpetrators and bring them to justice speedily! No stone must be left unturned in ensuring that everyone involved in this massacre is brought to their knees and face the full wrath of the law. “My prayers are with the good people of Ondo state and the state government at this difficult and trying time. My profound condolences also goes to the families of the deceased, the entire Catholic Church and the people of Owo kingdom.”
