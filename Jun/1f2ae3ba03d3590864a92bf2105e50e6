Laide Ajanaku, a lady who lost her parents in an attack on a Catholic church in Owo, Ondo state, says her parents never missed mass. On Sunday, gunmen attacked St. Francis Catholic Church in Owo, killing many worshippers and injuring several people. In an interview with CNN, Laide said she panicked when she heard the news and began calling anyone who knew about her parents’ whereabouts. “We heard it was an explosion at first. Then, we started panicking and calling everyone for information,” she said. “Somebody had my dad’s phone. I still don’t know who that person was. The person picked up and said my dad had been injured and had been taken to the hospital, but he didn’t know anything about my mum’s whereabouts. He later said my dad didn’t make it. “We eventually got through to a priest friend who confirmed that my mum had died as well. “They never missed Mass. My dad was a knight and the chairman of the Catholic Men Organisation. He was very religious and doctrinal. There was no doubt in my mind that they had witnessed the attack at the very least, but I didn’t know that they would be so affected.” Meanwhile, religious and political leaders have condemned the attack in Owo. According to President Muhammadu Buhari, only “demons” from the underworld would have conceived and carried out such an attack. On his part, Rotimi Akeredolu, governor of Ondo, called the incident a “calculated assault” on the people of Owo, and said his administration will hunt down the perpetrators and “make them pay”. Pope Francis also condemned the killings, saying his prayers are with the victims and the country.
