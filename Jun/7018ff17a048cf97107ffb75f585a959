A viral picture of a couple who were said to have been killed during an attack on a church by gunmen in Owo LGA, Ondo state, have been circulating on social media. On Sunday, the St Francis Catholic Church was attacked by gunmen during service. The gunmen were said to have detonated explosives before firing at the congregants. Many worshippers were killed in the attack, including children and women. Following the incident, some social media users had claimed a newly-wedded couple, simply identified as Kelvin and Blessing, were in the church for thanksgiving and killed by the gunmen. “They got married yesterday, they died today. I think they were in the church for thanksgiving. May the lost souls rests in peace. Owo, Ondo state,” a user wrote. Just saw an image of the couple who also died in the Owo Massacre. They got married yesterday, went to Church today for thanksgiving, and there their story ended. There won't be justice, guys. It's all in the past now.Just tell me what the actual shit of a country we live in — Eeee of the Most High (@EphraimSamuel9) June 5, 2022  <img class="alignnone size-large wp-image-708563" src="https://f5p3e9e4.stackpathcdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/IMG-20220605-WA0011-698x1024.jpg" alt="" width="698" height="1024" srcset="https://f5p3e9e4.stackpathcdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/IMG-20220605-WA0011-698x1024.jpg 698w, https://f5p3e9e4.stackpathcdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/IMG-20220605-WA0011-205x300.jpg 205w, https://f5p3e9e4.stackpathcdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/IMG-20220605-WA0011-16x24.jpg 16w, https://f5p3e9e4.stackpathcdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/IMG-20220605-WA0011-25x36.jpg 25w, https://f5p3e9e4.stackpathcdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/IMG-20220605-WA0011-33x48.jpg 33w, https://f5p3e9e4.stackpathcdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/IMG-20220605-WA0011.jpg 720w" sizes="(max-width: 698px) 100vw, 698px" /> In a video later released by the woman in the viral picture, she said they left the church after thanksgiving. “Those sharing my picture saying something happened to me and my husband, please nothing happened to us.
