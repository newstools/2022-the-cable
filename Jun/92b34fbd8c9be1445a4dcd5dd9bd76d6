FIFA has approved 26-man squads for this year’s World Cup in Qatar. The approval is one of the key outcomes of the football’s world governing body‘s council meeting on Thursday. Countries contesting at the World Cup were previously allowed 23-man squads. The increase in squad roster, according to FIFA, is due to unique timing of the event that takes place between November and December — instead of  June. The Switzerland-based governing body also cited the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic. “Given the need to retain additional flexibility due to the unique timing of the FIFA World Cup 2022™ in the global calendar, as well as the broader context of the disruptive effects caused by the COVID-19 pandemic on squads before and during tournaments, the Bureau has decided the following,” the statement read. “The maximum number of players on the release list has been increased from 35 to 55. “The number of players to be included on the final list has been increased to at least 23 and a maximum of 26. “The final matchday at club level for the 23 to 26 players nominated on the final list will be 13 November 2022. “No more than 26 people (up to 15 substitutes and 11 team officials – one of these officials must be the team doctor) will be allowed to sit on the team bench.” The 32-nation FIFA World Cup Qatar 2022, the first to hold in the Arab world, is set to hold from November 21 to December 18.
