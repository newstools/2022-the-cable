Godwin Obaseki, governor of Edo, says “many” Nigerians are looking for alternatives to the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) and the All Progressives Congress (APC). In a video posted by AIT on Tuesday, while explaining why PDP lost the recent Ekiti governorship election, Obaseki said many Nigerians no longer want APC and PDP and have now become ‘Obidients’. Supporters of Peter Obi, presidential candidate of the Labour Party (LP), identify themselves as ‘Obidients’. According to Obaseki, the PDP must find a way to make Nigerians more interested in the party . “How can PDP, the party, not win? They were not even number two. So, you can see that something is going on and we do not want this to be a trend. The future of our politics in this country is changing,” he said. “I do not know whether you are closely watching what is going on — the level of disenchantment within the parties. I am sure in all of our homes now, we have so many people now who call themselves ‘Obidients’. “I don’t know whether you have them in your house. Just ask them, ‘which party are you?’ They say ‘Obidients’; you understand. They do not want us; they are not talking about PDP or APC. “They are looking for alternatives and they are many. You see all of them queuing for their PVCs now. They are not looking at the direction of PDP or APC now. They are looking for alternatives. “If we do not curb this, if we do not make our party attractive, I do not know what will happen in the next elections.”
