An Abia high court has issued a stay of execution on the judgement nullifying the election of Ikechi Emenike as governorship candidate of the All Progressives Congress (APC). On May 26, the APC declared Emenike the winner of the governorship primary. Shortly after, ruling in a suit instituted by Chinedum Nwole and two others, the court declared that Emenike lacks the locus standi to contest the election because he had earlier been suspended from the party However, in another ruling on Wednesday, O.A Chijioke, the presiding judge, granted Emenike a stay of execution of the restraining order earlier imposed. The matter is still before the Owerri court of appeal to determine if the restraining judgment will stand or be quashed. Emenike had submitted that a court of competent and concurrent jurisdiction had already delivered judgment on the same matter on November 4, 2021. Emenike and two others had gone to court asking for the nullification of the purported “suspension” announced after a meeting by aggrieved members of the party in August 2021. Joined as defendants in the suit were Mai Mala Buni, former APC caretaker chairman, and Wilson Chimelulam Utaegbulam. In its judgment delivered on November 4, 2021, in the Suit No: HUM/41/2021, the court presided over by Benson Anya held that Emenike, who was the secretary of APC contact and strategy committee, “is an authentic and bonafide member of APC”. The court had also nullified their suspension.
