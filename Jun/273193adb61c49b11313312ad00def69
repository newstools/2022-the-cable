Kayode Fayemi, Ekiti governor and presidential hopeful, says he has not dropped his presidential bid for Vice-President Yemi Osinbajo. The Fayemi campaign organisation said this in reaction to assertions that he was pressured into dropping his aspiration for the vice-president after a closed-door meeting. In a statement on Friday, Femi Ige, spokesman of the campaign organisation, described the insinuation as “absolute rubbish”. Ige said the chairman of the Nigeria Governors Forum (NGF) is “favourably positioned” and has the backing of “real stakeholders” in the All Progressives Congress (APC). “[It is] absolute rubbish. No meeting took place between us and any aspirant about stepping down,” the statement reads. “We are undoubtedly among the leading aspirants for the position and one to watch in the race. “Our candidate has deep trust and respect among political leaders in the party and also from fellow governors who form a critical mass in the decision making process.” The spokesman said no amount of late night demarketing will work against the Fayemi presidential project.
