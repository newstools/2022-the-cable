The Economic and Financial Crimes Commission (EFCC), Borno zonal office, has reportedly invited Abdullahi Yusuf, senior special assistant to Babagana Zulum, governor of Borno, for questioning over a Facebook post. Abdullahi had, on May 29, published a post saying it was rumoured that a prominent federal lawmaker from Borno may be linked to the N80 billion fraud probe involving the accountant-general of the federation. Although the aide did not name the lawmaker, supporters of Muktari Betera, a member representing Biu federal constituency, went under the post to allege that he was referring to the lawmaker. On May 30, Abdullahi, in a bid to provide more clarification on his post, again took to Facebook to explain what he meant. “I did not mention any name. Unfortunately, some supporters of one particular lawmaker started raining all sorts of insults and threat directed at me. I only posted it because it was a trending issue,” he wrote. “I never in anyway mentioned any name. I just reposted it the way I read it. If anyone feels offended, let the person rest assured that it was not intended for any malice. I just saw a trending issue online and shared it.” Abdullahi was then said to have received an invitation from the EFCC zonal office in Maiduguri. He was reported to have arrived the EFCC office the next day and asked to provide the source of the information he shared on Facebook. The aide, however, reportedly said he picked the post randomly from Facebook and flagged it as a rumour being made by others which was misinterpreted. Abdullahi was said to have been detained afterwards despite efforts by family members to get him released, as the zonal head insisted that he was following a directive from the EFCC headquarters. However, when contacted, Wilson Uwujaren, EFCC spokesman, told TheCable he was yet to get information on the matter. “I will find out. I don’t have the report,” he said.
