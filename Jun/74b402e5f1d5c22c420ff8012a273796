Obinna Igbokwe, a Nigerian man resident in the United States, has reportedly shot his wife and mother-in-law before later killing himself. The Montgomery County Sheriff’s office, in a statement, said it responded to a call reporting a shooting in Aldine Westfield Road, Spring Texas, on Wednesday. It said upon arrival, officers discovered two victims. “One victim (Tangela Igbokwe) was taken to a local emergency room where she is listed in critical condition; the second victim (Linda Larkins) succumbed to her injuries at the scene,” the statement reads. The sheriff’s office said its investigation determined that 41-year-old Igbokwe shot his wife and her mother after a dispute about child custody, and fled the scene with Mansa Igbokwe, his three-month-old son. An “amber alert” was subsequently issued for the child. In a subsequent statement, the county office said it was contacted by the Corsicana police department that they had the child in their care. The police were said to have been contacted after a male suspected to be Igbokwe dropped off the child in a car seat at a local hotel, and said he would be right back, but never returned. “Since the male did not return, the Corsicana Police Department was contacted and learned the male left in a white passenger car, which they believed to be Igbokwe,” the statement reads. “At about 1:05 am, Ennis Police Department Officers located the white Honda Igbokwe was driving and attempted to stop the vehicle. After a short pursuit, the Honda stopped in a parking lot where officers observed and heard a single gunshot come from the interior of the Honda. “Law enforcement officers began life-saving measures and summoned medical personnel, but due to the severity of the injury Igbokwe succumbed to his wounds at a Dallas Hospital at about 5:20 am.”
