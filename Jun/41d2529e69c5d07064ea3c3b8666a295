The Department of State Services (DSS) has arrested Jeremiah Omoniyi, a journalist covering the ongoing governorship election in Ekiti state. Omoniyi is a student of Ekiti State University. The secret service arrested and whisked away Omoniyi, a campus journalist deployed by the Centre for Journalism Innovation and Development (CJID), for posting a video which showed party agents engaging in fisticuffs at PU 001, Ward 01, Irepodun Ifelodun LGA. The polling unit is that of Ayodele Fayose, former Ekiti governor. TheCable observed as the DSS operatives, about 15 in number, arrived at the polling unit to ask for who posted the video at the polling unit before they approached Omoniyi. The journalist, however, denied posting the video. Voting is still on across the 16 LGAs in the state. While some political leaders said there is a massive voter turnout, others alleged there have been cases of vote buying. Biodun Olujimi, senator representing Ekiti central, said the voter turnout in the Ekiti governorship election is massive. But Kemi Elebute-Halle, governorship candidate of the Action Democratic Party (ADP) in Ekiti, alleged that other political parties are inducing voters with money.
