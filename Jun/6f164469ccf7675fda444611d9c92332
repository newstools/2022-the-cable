Peter Mbah, governorship candidate of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) in Enugu, has condemned the attack on a church in Owo, Ondo state. On Sunday, St. Francis Catholic Church in Owo was attacked by gunmen while mass was in progress. Mbah, in a statement by Dan Nwomeh, his media aide, urged law enforcement agencies to do everything possible to apprehend the perpetrators. “I am extremely repulsed by the dastardly attack on St Francis Catholic Church, Owo, Ondo State, in which scores of innocent worshippers were gruesomely killed,” he said. “The shooting was horrific, barbaric and repugnant to all the values we hold dear as a society. “My heart goes out to the Bishop of the Catholic Diocese of Ondo, Bishop Jude Arogundade, the entire Catholic community, victims of the shooting and those that lost their beloved ones. “It is my hope that the law enforcement agencies will do all that is humanly possible to apprehend the perpetrators with a view to bringing them to book. “May their souls rest in perfect peace in the bosom of the Lord. Amen.”
