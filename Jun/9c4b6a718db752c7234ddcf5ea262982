The national working committee (NWC) of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP), on Wednesday, inaugurated its campaign council for the Osun state governorship election. The election is scheduled to take place on July 16. Ademola Adeleke, a former senator, is the party’s governorship candidate. The PDP had named Douye Diri, governor of Bayelsa, as chairman of the committee. Seyi Makinde of Oyo; Aminu Tambuwal of Sokoto; Okezie Ikpeazu of Abia; Nyesom Wike of Rivers; Udom Emmanuel of Akwa Ibom; Ifeanyi Ugwuanyi of Enugu; Bala Mohammed of Bauchi; Ahmadu Fintiri of Adamawa; Godwin Obaseki of Edo, and Samuel Ortom of Benue were appointed as vice-chairmen. But they were all absent from the inauguration, including Diri. Those who were present at the event include Ifeanyi Okowa, PDP vice-presidential candidate; Darius Ishaku, governor of Taraba, and other NWC members. Speaking before the inauguration, Umar Damagum, acting chairman of the PDP, expressed confidence that the party will win the gubernatorial election. “We have a very popular candidate in Osun and we have no reason not to win the election,” he said. “So I believe with the calibre of people in this committee, I’m sure Osun will become ours, you will make a lot of sacrifices for the task ahead of you, engage stakeholders that are aggrieved.”
