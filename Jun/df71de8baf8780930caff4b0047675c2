There is controversy over an alleged attempt to replace the ad hoc staff for the All Progressives Congress (APC) presidential primary election. TheCable learnt some youths were trained for the special convention, only to be replaced on Tuesday. But Dapo Abiodun, governor of Ogun state, reportedly intervened and resolved the matter. However, TheCable also learnt there is an attempt to compromise the delegates’ list in favour of Senate President Ahmad Lawan. On Monday, Abdullahi Adamu, APC national chairman, said Lawan was the party’s consensus candidate. This is contrary to the agreement of the APC governors who want the presidential ticket to be zoned to the south. Some members of the party’s national working committee (NWC) aligned with the governors, saying Adamu’s choice was his “opinion”. “The secretary of the accreditation committee, Senator Gumel, a personal assistant to Lawan. Orji Kalu, senate whip, and Hope Uzodimma, are also working to ensure that only delegates that will vote Lawan will get into Eagle Square,” a source told TheCable.
