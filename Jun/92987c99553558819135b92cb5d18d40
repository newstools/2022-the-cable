Ovie Omo-Agege, deputy senate president, has congratulated Bola Tinubu, former governor of Lagos, on his victory at the presidential primary of the All Progressives Congress (APC). Tinubu was declared winner of the APC primary on Wednesday after he polled 1,271 votes to defeat his closest rival, Rotimi Amaechi, who scored 316 votes. In a statement by Ima Niboro, his director of communications and media strategy, Omo-Agege expressed optimism that Tinubu would win the 2023 presidential election. He commended President Muhammadu Buhari and the APC for giving all aspirants a level-playing field, and also praised the APC special convention committee for successfully conducting the primary. While calling on Tinubu to be magnanimous in victory, Omo-Agege urged all presidential aspirants to join hands with the party’s presidential candidate to ensure victory for the APC. “Not everyone gave APC a chance to conduct a free, fair, credible presidential primary. With the undercurrents in the buildup, some had predicted that our great party would go into extinction after this convention,” the statement reads. “But with the transparent process that saw the emergence of Asiwaju Tinubu as our party standard bearer, I am confident more than ever before that this is the beginning of even greater tidings for our party. “We proved our critics wrong. We have shown that with unity of purpose, the sky is our starting point.” The deputy senate president called on Nigerians to support Tinubu and other APC candidates at all levels in the forthcoming polls. Omo-Agege is the standard-bearer for APC in the 2023 governorship election in Delta state.
