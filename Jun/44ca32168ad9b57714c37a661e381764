Rotimi Akeredolu, governor of Ondo, says the state government has cancelled the June 12 celebrations in honour of the victims of the Owo attack. St Francis Catholic Church in Owo was attacked by gunmen on June 4, with at least 40 people killed, and over 60 persons injured. On Thursday, the federal government claimed the attack was masterminded by the Islamic State in West Africa Province (ISWAP). In a statement to honour the victims of the attack, Akeredolu said the June 12 celebrations will be cancelled. Democracy Day is celebrated on June 12 of every year. On Friday, the federal government declared Monday as public holiday in commemoration of Democracy Day. “In honour of the victims of the terror attack at St. Francis Catholic Church in Owo, the Ondo State Government has canceled this year’s June 12 celebration,” the governor wrote on Twitter. “The cancellation is to enable the people of Ondo State mourn their loved ones who lost their lives in the horrific attack.”
