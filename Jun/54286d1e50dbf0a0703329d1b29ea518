Gunmen have reportedly killed at least six persons at Sabo axis of Ondo town, Ondo state. The gunmen were said to have invaded the community on Wednesday night. According to The Punch, the gunmen were on motorcycles when they carried out the attack. They reportedly robbed some residents of the area before they left the scene. When TheCable contacted Funmilayo Odunlami, Ondo police spokesperson, she said the attack was a robbery incident and that only four people were shot. Odunlami added that the incident was not a reprisal and that those who were shot were from different ethnic backgrounds. The police spokesperson was silent on the death toll recorded during the attack but she said some of the victims are currently receiving treatment. “There was an attempted robbery and then the men who attempted to rob opened fire on some people,” she said. “Among the people who were shot, there was a Yourba man, even an Igbo man. There was no form of reprisal on northerners. “They were not northerners. There was a shooting and four people were shot at. There was no attack on the Hausa community.” Last Sunday, St Francis Catholic Church in Owo, Ondo was attacked by gunmen on Sunday with several persons killed and others injured.
