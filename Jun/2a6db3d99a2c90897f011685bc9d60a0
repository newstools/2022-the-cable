The Peter Obi Support Network (POSN) has asked the Anambra government to disclose the details of savings made by the former governor when he was in charge of the state. Obi, presidential candidate of the Labour Party (LP), had said he invested $20 million of Anambra’s funds in International Breweries, and the investment was worth $100 million as of 2018. TheCable had, however, reported that a $12.24 million investment was made by Obi’s administration at the time, and it is now worth $5.38 million. In a statement on Wednesday, Adegbite Adekunle, POSN’s deputy director of communications, said the Anambra government should disclose the details of the financial status of the state during Obi’s tenure. “The decision of the Anambra state government to confirm that the former governor of Anambra state, Peter Obi invested state funds in SABMiller is a welcome development after repeated denials by his predecessor, former governor, Willie Obiano,” Adekunle said. “It is obvious with the statement by Anambra commissioner of finance, Ifeatu Onejeme, that Peter Obi during his administration invested state funds while other governors were borrowing their states into penury. “This is a confirmation that Peter Obi is a good manager of resources, and further confirms what former minister of finance, Mrs Ngozi Okonjo-Iweala, wrote in her book that the former governor of Anambra was hammering on investment of resources while other governors were talking about sharing the resources during the era of oil boom. “We, therefore, request that the state commissioner for finance do take a step further and release all details of the millions of dollars saved for the state by Peter Obi’s administration before he handed over to the former governor, Willie Obiano, so that Ndi Anambra and Nigerians will know the truth about the condition of state resources when Peter Obi handed over to Willie Obiano.”
