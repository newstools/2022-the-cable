The senate has resolved to honour Ejiro Otarigho, a tanker driver based in Delta state. At the weekend, Otarigho was seen driving a tanker on fire in Agbarho community in Delta. His bravery is said to have saved lives and property in the community. The decision of the upper legislative chamber to honour him followed a motion sponsored by Omo-Agege, deputy senate president, on Tuesday. The motion was co-sponsored by James Manager and Peter Nwaoboshi, senators representing Delta south and north respectively. While moving the motion, Omo-Agege said the death of “thousands” was averted by the act of Otarigho. “His extraordinary display of courage, reflex application of special driving skills, and huge risk to his own life, prevented a huge national tragedy and catastrophe by driving a burning tanker loaded with inflammable petroleum products from residential areas to safety so that thousands of our people may not die in an inferno that would also have consumed so much property in Agbarho, Delta State on Friday, June 10, 2022,” he said. The prayers of the motion read: “To invite Mr. Ejiro Otarigho to the Chamber of the Senate for public commendation by the President of the Senate, Most Distinguished Senator (Dr.) Ibrahim Lawan. “Recommend Mr. Ejiro Otarigho to His Excellency, President Muhammadu Buhari, GCFR, President and Commander-in-Chief of the Armed Forces of Nigeria, for a befitting National Honour as Mr. President may deem fit for his extraordinary act of bravery, courage and skill that prevented the loss of human lives and property on a massive scale.”
