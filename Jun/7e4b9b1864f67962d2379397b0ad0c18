There is a new twist in the alleged child organ harvesting case involving Ike Ekweremadu, former deputy senate president. On Thursday, the London Metropolitan Police charged Ekweremadu and Beatrice, his wife, to court over the allegation of bringing a child to the UK for organ harvesting. The investigation was launched after detectives were alerted to potential offences under modern slavery legislation in May 2022. The UK authorities said the “child” had “been safeguarded”, while the police added that its operatives “are working closely with partners on continued support”. TheCable subsequently reported that the former senator had written to the UK high commission to support a visa application of a “donor” listed as Ukpo Nwamini David. In the letter, Ekweremadu said Ukpo was undergoing “medical investigations for a kidney donation to Ms Sonia Ekweremadu”. Although the police had said the donor was 15, data from his international passport indicate that he is 21 years old. According to information on the passport data page of Ukpo, he was born on October 12, 2000. The date of issuance of the passport was listed as November 4, 2021, which is a few weeks before Ekweremadu wrote to the UK high commission in respect of the medical visa application. A check on the Bank Verification Number (BVN) portal also showed Ukpo’s date of birth as October 12, 2000. The case against the former senator and his wife has been adjourned till July 7. After appearing before Uxbridge magistrates’ court on Thursday, they were denied bail and remanded in custody.
