The Ahmad Lawan campaign organisation has named Orji Kalu, senate chief whip, as the director-general of the campaign committee. Lawan is seeking the presidential ticket of the All Progressives Congress (APC). The APC presidential primary is billed to hold from June 6 to 8. The chairpersons of the eight campaign committees were announced at a meeting held in Abuja on Thursday. In May, Kalu withdrew from the 2023 presidential race and endorsed Lawan. According to a statement from Lawan’s office, the team met to fine-tune strategies and consolidate on the gains made so far. Members of the committee include Auwal Lawan, chairman of finance and budget; Sani Musa, co-chairman; Ikechukwu Obiora, chairman of strategy and planning; Betty Apiafi, deputy chairman; Barau Jibrin, chairman of contact and mobilisation, and Peter Nwaoboshi, deputy chairman. Other members of the committee are Aliyu Abdullahi, chairman of media and publicity; Femi Fani-Kayode, deputy chairman; Lawal Daura, chairman of security and intelligence, and Mohammed Barau as deputy chairman. Others are Bello Mandiya, chairman of transport and logistics; Hillary Bisong, deputy chairman; Mustapha Audu, chairman of youth groups, and Aisha Ismail, chairperson of women groups. “Lawan’s team led by Kalu is expected to strengthen the campaign organisation and build a stronger cohesion that would deliver the All Progressives Congress (APC) ticket to  the senate president during the presidential primaries, and ultimately lead him to victory in the general election,” the statement reads. Meanwhile, Fani-Kayode, as of April 2022, was listed as a member of the presidential campaign organisation of Yahaya Bello, Kogi governor.
