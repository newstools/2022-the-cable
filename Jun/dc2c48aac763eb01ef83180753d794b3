President Muhammadu Buhari has directed increased efforts in securing the release of the victims of the Abuja-Kaduna train attack. The passengers were abducted when bandits attacked the Kaduna-bound train in March. TheCable had reported how eleven of the over 50 abducted persons were freed earlier in the month. Giving an update on efforts to secure the release of the remaining victims, Garba Shehu, presidential spokesperson, in a statement issued on Tuesday, said the federal government is “making all efforts to trace and bring back the 51 or more still being held in custody”. He said the government is continuing on a two-lane approach – kinetic and non-kinetic — to secure the passengers’ safe release. “The kidnappers made a demand for the release of their own children and upon the settlement of that issue, they let go eleven of the victims, even though more were expected,” the statement reads. “The setback notwithstanding, the government is not leaving any stone unturned in the efforts to bring all of the hostages back. “The defence, security and intelligence agencies have given assurances to intensify operational engagements geared towards securing the rescue of all hostages and restoring peace to all parts of the country. Government is also mindful of efforts of some patriotic and influential persons and institutions that are helping in securing the safe release of the hostages. “The president’s clear directive on the issue is that the hostages must be brought home alive. The country’s military and security agencies are aware of their duty to the nation and are determined to give effect to the President’s charge with increased urgency.” Shehu added that the president welcomed the return of the recently released passengers back to their families, and expressed his commitment to ensuring that those still in captivity are released and reunited with their loved ones “in the shortest time possible”.
