James Kantoma, chairman of the Jos east LGA chapter of the Christian Association of Nigeria (CAN) in Plateau state, has been abducted by gunmen. Kantoma is also parish priest of St. Anthony Catholic Church in Angware, Jos East LGA of Plateau state. Alabo Alfred, police spokesman in the Plateau, confirmed the incident to NAN on Monday. Alfred said officers of the command have been deployed to the community to ensure the cleric regains his freedom and the abductors are apprehended. “Our men are already working to ensure that the cleric regains his freedom and apprehend those behind the abduction,” he said. Polycarp Lubo, CAN chairman in the state, described the abduction as a sad incident. “Since the gunmen took the priest away, we have not heard anything either from him or the abductors,” he said. ”This is so sad, but we are praying for him that no harm will befall him wherever he is.” The development comes hours after Oluwaseun Aderogba, the Anglican bishop of Jebba diocese in Kwara, his wife, and driver were abducted by gunmen along the new Oyo/Ogbomoso expressway in Oyo state. Days before the latest abduction, Samuel Kanu, prelate of the Methodist Church Nigeria (MCN), Dennis Mark, the bishop of Owerri, as well as another cleric were abducted by gunmen along the Enugu-Port Harcourt expressway in Umunneochi LGA of Abia state. The Methodist Prelate and the two other clerics were, however, released hours after their abduction after reportedly paying ransom of N100 million.
