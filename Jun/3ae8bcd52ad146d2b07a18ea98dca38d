Kayode Fayemi, governor of Ekiti, has directed that human and medical resources be sent to Ondo state following the killing of worshippers in a church in the Owo area of the state. The governor issued the directive to Banji Filani, the commissioner for health and human services. In a statement by Yinka Oyebode, his chief press secretary, Fayemi condemned the attack at St Francis Catholic Church in Owo. The governor described the incident as “barbaric and callous”. According to him, there can never be any justification for the heinous behaviour of the assailants. The governor commiserated with Rotimi Akeredolu, governor of Ondo, and the people of the state on the fatal attack. He urged security agencies in the state to ensure that the perpetrators of the crime are apprehended and made to face the wrath of the law. “The perpetrators of this dastardly act should not go unpunished. We call on relevant security agencies in the state to spring into action and ensure that they are brought to book,” he said. “Our condolences to the government and good people of Ondo state as well as families that lost their loved ones in the carnage.”
