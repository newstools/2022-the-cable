The national working committee (NWC) of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) has set up a committee to screen the vice-presidential candidate of the party for the 2023 elections. In a statement issued on Tuesday, Debo Ologunagba, PDP spokesperson, said the screening of the candidate will take place at the party’s headquarters on Thursday. Tom Ikimi, former minister of foreign affairs, is the chairman of the committee, while Akilu Indabawa, will serve as the secretary. Other members of the 12-member committee include Idris Wada, former governor of Kogi; Osita Chidoka, former minister of aviation; Binta Bello, Mutiat Adedoja, Austin Opara and Aisha Madawaki. The committee members also include Ayotunde George-Ologun, Chidiebelu Mofus and Fidelis Tapgun. Sunday Omobo will serve as an administrative secretary to the committee. TheCable had reported how sources within the party said a PDP committee endorsed Nyesom Wike, governor of Rivers, as the vice-presidential candidate of the party for the 2023 elections. TheCable understands that the NWC members also voted 13-3 to endorse the report of the panel, which had earlier nominated Wike for the VP ticket over Ifeanyi Okowa, governor of Delta. The NWC members subsequently communicated their decision to Atiku Abubakar, the presidential candidate of the party. Wike, Okowa, and Udom Emmanuel, Akwa Ibom governor, were the three candidates considered by the panel.
