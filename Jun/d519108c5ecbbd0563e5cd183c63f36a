The federal government has unveiled 20 high-tech buses powered by compressed natural gas (CNG) for civil servants in the federal capital territory (FCT). Folashade Yemi-Esan, head of the civil service of the federation, unveiled the buses at an event held on Tuesday in Abuja. She said the initiative is a collaboration with FEMADEC Group, a private engineering and construction company, adding that the project is part of the efforts toward improving the welfare of civil servants in Abuja. She said the gas-powered buses will provide efficient, affordable, and safe transportation that will convey civil servants to and from their workplaces, especially those living within FCT and its environs. Yemi-Esan added that easing the transportation burden of civil servants has been one of the targets of the present administration, adding that the government has always sought ways to achieve a healthier and safer environment for civil servants. “This pillar is targeted at addressing issues of the socio-economic wellbeing of civil servants, which, if not tackled holistically, can impede workers’ efficiency,” she said. “The number of buses will be scaled up to 40 in the second phase of the project.” Ngozi Onwudiwe, permanent secretary, service welfare office, said the scheme’s pilot phase will commence across six routes in the FCT. Uchenna Obi, director of the Federal Integrated Housing Scheme (FIHS) who represented the permanent secretary, listed the routes as Karu-Jikwoyi/Orozo/Karshi; AYA/Nyanya/Mararaba/Ado/Masaka; Berger/Kado/Gwagwa/Karmo; Kado Estate/Gwarimpa; Airport Road; and Kubwa/Dutse Alhaji. On his part, Fola Akinola, chief executive officer of FEMADEC Group, said the initiative to provide the buses started in 2019 when the federal government discussed switching from petrol-powered cars to gas-powered vehicles. He added that the buses, which will run on CNG, came at a critical time when Nigeria was battling with the rising cost of diesel.
