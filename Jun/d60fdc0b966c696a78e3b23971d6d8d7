The Nigerian Electricity Regulatory Commission (NERC) says it is looking to recruit qualified persons for over 50 roles in the commission. The commission announced the recruitment on Monday in a statement signed by its management. Some of the roles to be filled include senior manager, compliance; deputy general manager, legal; principal manager, tariff and rates; assistant manager; customer complaints and manager, market analysis, and competition. NERC said selected candidates will be employed into various departments including market and competition analysis, utility rate setting, electrical engineering, consumer protection, finance and accounting, data acquisition and analytics, among others. Applicants are required to submit only one application and multiple applications would result in a disqualification of the applicant. NERC also said only shortlisted candidates would be contacted for the next process of the recruitment exercise. “Applicants should please note that this is a completely online application process, and no paper application and CVs should be sent to the commission,” the statement reads. The closing date for the online application is July 15, 2022. The commission advised interested applicants to log on to careers.nerc.gov.ng and follow the instructions for the application. “The detailed list of vacancies is available on the application portal,” it said. NERC is an independent regulatory institution created under the provisions of the Electric Power Sector Reform Act. Its head office is in Abuja but the commission has office presence in many states of the country.
