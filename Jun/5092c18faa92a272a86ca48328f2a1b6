Gunmen who attacked Maranatha Baptist Church and St. Moses Catholic Church in Rubu community, Kajuru LGA of Kaduna, have reportedly demanded N100 million ransom. Elisha Mari, the village head of the community who was abducted but later released, said this on Monday when heads of security agencies and officials of the Kaduna government visited the area. Addressing journalists, he also said 36 worshipers were abducted during the attack, which occurred on Sunday. According to Mari, the bandits freed him, being the traditional leader of the community, and asked him to go and bring N100 million to secure the release of other remaining victims. The traditional ruler said the attackers invaded the community on 30 motorcycles and started shooting sporadically. TheCable had earlier reported that three persons were confirmed dead during the attack. According to the traditional leader, the three people who were killed had attempted to repel the gunmen. He said it took two hours to reach the hideout of the gunmen in the forest. Meanwhile, there has been no development on 14 other people abducted on Saturday in Mararaban Kajuru, also in Kajuru LGA. Sources in the area said the bandits are yet to make any contact with the community. The development comes weeks after gunmen attacked a Catholic church in Owo, Ondo state, and killed 40 people.
