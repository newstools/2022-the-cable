Abdullahi Adamu, national chairman of the All Progressives Congress (APC), says Ahmad Lawan, senate president, contested the party’s primary for Yobe north senatorial district. Adamu spoke on Monday while fielding questions from journalists after presenting Biodun Oyebanji, governor-elect of Ekiti, to President Muhammadu Buhari. The APC Yobe north senatorial ticket had sparked controversy after Bashir Machina, who won the primary, declared that he will not step down for Lawan. TheCable had reported that Lawan, who is currently representing Yobe north in the senate, was eventually listed as the APC senatorial candidate. Lawan had, in May, contested for the APC presidential ticket, but lost to Bola Tinubu, the standard-bearer of the party. Asked why the APC replaced Machina with Lawan in the senatorial candidates list, Adamu said he does not have time for “negativities”. “If you face me with positives, I have time for all of that. I will stand here and answer all of your questions,” he said. “I cannot respond to every speculation particularly when they are negative, especially when they are from mischief makers.” When asked if the senate president took part in the senatorial primary, Adamu claimed that Lawan participated within the approved timeline. “Go and find out from the person who is responsible for organising the primary. I have done my bit. I do know in my honour that he did participate within the timeline,” he said. The APC national chairman did not disclose when the senatorial primary, which he claimed led to the emergence of Lawan as a candidate, was organised. In the build-up to the APC presidential primary, Adamu announced Lawan as the consensus presidential candidate for the party. Adamu’s choice was vehemently rejected by members of the APC national working committee and the northern governors.
