Samuel Ortom, governor of Benue, has described as “barbaric” the killings of farmers in Edumoga, Okpokwu LGA of the state. Several residents were killed when gunmen invaded the community on Sunday. Buildings in the community were said to have been razed while the attack lasted. In a statement by Nathaniel Ikyur, his chief press secretary, Ortom condemned the attack, describing the murderers as “cowards and criminals” who must be fished out and prosecuted. He said killings have become nationwide since the federal government has failed to act appropriately. “When I started shouting about the menace of killer herdsmen in my state, many people thought I was playing to the gallery. Gradually, this has spread to all other parts of the country because the federal government has refused to act appropriately and decisively against them,” he said. “This is the reason why they have continued with impunity. It has clearly shown that the killing of these innocent farmers in Edumoga, Okpokwu local government is yet another barbaric act by herdsmen. They must not go unpunished.” Ortom reiterated his earlier call on his people to stand up to defend themselves against the invaders “because even the laws of the land allow for self-defence”. “We are capable of defending ourselves if authorities concerned refused to do so. We are not cowards. We are just law-abiding,” Ortom said. The governor said the peaceful attitude of Benue people which accommodates others should not be taken for granted. In March, scores of persons were killed in Guma, Kwande and Gwer west LGAs of the state, when gunmen invaded communities in the areas.
