The Enugu police command, on Thursday, arraigned 21 staff members of the state water corporation for allegedly stealing items worth N15 million. The accused were arraigned on a two-count charge bordering on conspiracy and stealing. Appearing before Ngozi Edeani, chief magistrate at the Enugu east magistrate’s court, the defendants pleaded not guilty to the charges. Innocent Egbuaba, the prosecution counsel, told the court that “the accused had between December 2021 and January 2022 at Ajali water scheme at Ajali in Ezeagu local government area (LGA) of Enugu, conspired among themselves to steal”. He said the defendants later stole armoured cables, copper bags and one other item valued at N10 million, as well as a water treatment chemical valued at N5 million, which were the property of the Enugu state water corporation. Egbuaba said the loss of N5 million water treatment chemicals was never reported to the Enugu state water corporation. According to him, the offences are punishable under sections 495 and 353 of the Criminal Code, Cap 30, Vol. ll, Revised Laws of Enugu State, 2004. Emmanuel Awuda, counsel to the defendants, pleaded with the court to grant his clients bail, adding that the offence committed was bailable. According to the counsel, section 36(5) of the 1999 constitution as amended, provides that an accused is presumed innocent until proven guilty, a provision which is also captured in section 9 of the Enugu State Administration of Criminal Justice, 2007. “My lord, we have a reliable surety who is present in the court to take them on bail,” Awuda said. C.D. Okoro, the counsel to the second defendant, made the same appeal to the court. The chief magistrate, however, granted the accused bail in the sum of N20 million each and sureties in like sum. She also ordered that the sureties must be grade level 14 civil servants, who must reside within the jurisdiction of the court. The matter was thereafter adjourned till July 27 for further hearing.
