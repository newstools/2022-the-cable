At least 22 farmers have been reportedly abducted in the federal capital territory (FCT). The incident was said to have occurred on Thursday in Rafin-Daji, Gurdi community of Abaji area council. Usman Mohammed, officer-in-charge of the Yaba divisional headquarters 8j Abaji, confirmed the incident to TheCable on Friday. The development is the latest in the reported cases of abductions in the nation’s capital. States in the north-central geo-political zone, in which the FCT is situated, have been targets of attacks by gunmen. In March, gunmen invaded the palace of Hassan Shamidozhi, a traditional ruler in Bukpe community, Kwali area council of the FCT and abducted him. In December 2019, Ibrahim Pada, the traditional ruler of Rubochi community in Kuje area council of the FCT, was abducted by gunmen. Pada was kidnapped at his residence after his attackers, who reportedly dressed in military uniform, shot in the air before taking him away. Two children of the monarch were reportedly injured in the attack. He was, however, later released after a few days in captivity. Editor’s note: The featured image was used for illustration.
