The federal government says it will sanction oil and gas companies that fail to comply with human capacity development (HCD) provisions contained in the Nigerian Oil and Gas Industry Content Development (NOGICD) Act 2010. Simbi Wabote, executive secretary, Nigerian Content Development and Monitoring Board (NCDMB), said this on Tuesday while delivering a keynote address at the second edition of the virtual stakeholders workshop for human capacity development in the Nigerian oil and gas industry. Speaking on the topic, ‘Human capacity development: The pillar for Nigeria’s industrialisation’, Wabote warned that the board would enforce periodic forensic audit for HCD programmes. He added that companies found violating the NOGICD Act, and the ministerial regulations in executing cost-intensive capacity development initiatives as mandated by the act, would be sanctioned. “It has come to the attention of the board that some operating companies and services companies are reluctant to implement the HCD programmes as directed by the board,” Wabote said. “Most of the companies are testing the mettle of the board and I want to use this opportunity to inform erring companies that the board will meet appropriate sanctions to them as prescribed by the Act.” He added that the board was mandated to ensure that the industry derives maximum benefits from huge investments and also ensure beneficiaries of the HCD training programmes find gainful employment in the sector. ”With the rapid advancement in technologies used in the oil and gas industry, our industry will continue to be manned by foreigners and expatriates if we do not keep pace with the spate of technological development by developing the human capabilities required for the challenges of modern industrial technologies,” he said.
