Dakuku Peterside, former director-general of the Nigerian Maritime Administration and Safety Agency (NIMASA), has commiserated with the Rivers state chapter of the All Progressives Congress (APC) over the death of its delegates. On Thursday, the state delegates were involved in an accident on their way from Abuja where they had participated in the party’s presidential primary, which was concluded on Wednesday. Tonye Cole, governorship candidate of the APC in Rivers, in an earlier statement, identified the victims as “Hon. Onimiteim Vincent Samuel and Barr. Prince Loveday Motats”. Some other yet-to-be-identified persons were also said to have been injured in the crash. Speaking on the development, Peterside expressed confidence that the sacrifices made by the deceased in their lifetime to build the APC in the state would not be in vain. “Even as it is natural to grief when death strikes in families like in this instance, I have the confidence that the sacrifices they made in their lifetime to build the APC in their respective local chapters into a viable democratic institution, shall not be in vain,” he said. “They have planted, completed their parts, and left though leaving us in tears, but their democratic credentials should always spur us to greater service.” He prayed to God to comfort the affected families and grant quick healing to all those involved in the accident. He also asked APC faithful in the state to rally round the bereaved families.
