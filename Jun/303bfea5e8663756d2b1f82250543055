Mascot Kalu, brother to Orji Kalu, former governor of Abia, has secured the ticket to contest the Abia governorship election on the platform of the Action Peoples Party (APP). Mascot Kalu contested unopposed at the primary, which took place on Tuesday in Umuahia, the Abia capital. Ndem Chukwu, another aspirant, had earlier stepped down and asked his supporters to back Kalu. Kalu, in his acceptance speech, said he would turn around the state from the current “hardship” caused by the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP). Speaking to journalists after the election, the APP candidate said his experience as chief of staff will give him an edge over other candidates in the 2023 election. He also said the APP has the capacity to win the 2023 governorship election in the state, adding that the Electoral Act 2022 will help in delivering free, fair and credible polls. “We have nine months to grow the party further, in terms of its membership and capacity. I have confidence that the electoral act will make positive impact in terms of free, fair and credible elections,” NAN quoted him as saying. “This is because of the experience from the recent elections so far conducted in some parts of the country.” Kalu defected from the All Progressives Congress (APC) after losing the house of representatives by-election for Aba north and south federal constituency in 2020.
