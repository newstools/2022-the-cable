The National Youth Democratic Assembly, a youth political platform, has advised youths to ensure active participation in the 2023 general election. Henry Nwaiwu, chairperson of the non-governmental organisation (NGO), said this on Wednesday at a sensitisation programme held in Port Harcourt, the Rivers capital. According to Nwaiwu, Nigeria as a country is in “dire need” of competent leaders, and youths will play a significant part on making things better. “The country has gone so bad from the top to the bottom that things are not at ease. The masses have suffered greatly and are still suffering in this country. The pains are excruciating, the poverty rate is unimaginable, and the hardship is untold. All these are the outcome of bad governance and leadership,” he said. “That’s why we need to build hope and confidence in the minds of Nigerian youths who have lost faith in Nigeria to ensure a leadership that will enthrone an era of responsive and responsible governance in our country. “This time, we must denounce tortoise tricks as social destabilisation. This nation belongs to all of us and we must take it back as the leaders of tomorrow and soldiers of the nation.” He also urged youths to remain hopeful for a better Nigeria, adding that NYDA as a political platform is ready to do what is necessary to make a change and advocate for good governance.
