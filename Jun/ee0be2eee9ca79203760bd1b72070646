Target participants will receive training on effective and efficient collection methods, hygiene skills while working in waste and will also receive materials including PPE to ensure their safety. The program seeks to help participants, through their transferable skills program, to improve earning capacity of the women by 200% from current earnings of about $2 a day. <img class="alignnone wp-image-707143" src="https://f5p3e9e4.stackpathcdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/Screenshot_20220602-133819_Office.jpg" alt="" width="550" height="364" srcset="https://f5p3e9e4.stackpathcdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/Screenshot_20220602-133819_Office.jpg 889w, https://f5p3e9e4.stackpathcdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/Screenshot_20220602-133819_Office-300x199.jpg 300w, https://f5p3e9e4.stackpathcdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/Screenshot_20220602-133819_Office-768x509.jpg 768w, https://f5p3e9e4.stackpathcdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/Screenshot_20220602-133819_Office-24x16.jpg 24w, https://f5p3e9e4.stackpathcdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/Screenshot_20220602-133819_Office-36x24.jpg 36w, https://f5p3e9e4.stackpathcdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/Screenshot_20220602-133819_Office-48x32.jpg 48w" sizes="(max-width: 550px) 100vw, 550px" /> GBF will partner with experienced sector aggregators including RecyclePoints Limited, Greenhill Recycling Limited, RecycleGarb Hub Limited, Fifthseed Recycling Limited, Green Axis, Idrate Solutions Limited, Ceetee Recyclers Limited, Chanja Datti, Recycling Co.Ltd, Trash Monger Limited, WasteXchange Limited, through which the initiative will be implemented across the 6 regions of the Country. <img class="alignnone wp-image-707130" src="https://f5p3e9e4.stackpathcdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/DSC_1650-scaled.jpg" alt="" width="550" height="367" srcset="https://f5p3e9e4.stackpathcdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/DSC_1650-scaled.jpg 2560w, https://f5p3e9e4.stackpathcdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/DSC_1650-300x200.jpg 300w, https://f5p3e9e4.stackpathcdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/DSC_1650-1024x683.jpg 1024w, https://f5p3e9e4.stackpathcdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/DSC_1650-768x512.jpg 768w, https://f5p3e9e4.stackpathcdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/DSC_1650-1536x1024.jpg 1536w, https://f5p3e9e4.stackpathcdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/DSC_1650-2048x1365.jpg 2048w, https://f5p3e9e4.stackpathcdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/DSC_1650-24x16.jpg 24w, https://f5p3e9e4.stackpathcdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/DSC_1650-36x24.jpg 36w, https://f5p3e9e4.stackpathcdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/DSC_1650-48x32.jpg 48w" sizes="(max-width: 550px) 100vw, 550px" /> <img class="alignnone wp-image-707133" src="https://f5p3e9e4.stackpathcdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/DSC_1614-scaled.jpg" alt="" width="550" height="367" srcset="https://f5p3e9e4.stackpathcdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/DSC_1614-scaled.jpg 2560w, https://f5p3e9e4.stackpathcdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/DSC_1614-300x200.jpg 300w, https://f5p3e9e4.stackpathcdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/DSC_1614-1024x683.jpg 1024w, https://f5p3e9e4.stackpathcdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/DSC_1614-768x512.jpg 768w, https://f5p3e9e4.stackpathcdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/DSC_1614-1536x1024.jpg 1536w, https://f5p3e9e4.stackpathcdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/DSC_1614-2048x1365.jpg 2048w, https://f5p3e9e4.stackpathcdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/DSC_1614-24x16.jpg 24w, https://f5p3e9e4.stackpathcdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/DSC_1614-36x24.jpg 36w, https://f5p3e9e4.stackpathcdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/DSC_1614-48x32.jpg 48w" sizes="(max-width: 550px) 100vw, 550px" /> Speaking on the project, the President of The Coca-Cola Foundation, Saadia Madsbjerg, said the idea of the initiative was to create an economic ecosystem that would not only support environmentally beneficial actions but would also provide women with skills and trainings in the waste management value chain – enabling their economic empowerment and in turn improving quality of life for their families.
