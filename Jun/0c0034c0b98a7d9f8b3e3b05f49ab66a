Gunmen have attacked the Celestial Church of Christ at Wasimi in Ewekoro LGA of Ogun state. Two worshippers were abducted in the incident which took place in the early hours of Tuesday. Abimbola Oyeyemi, the Ogun police spokesperson, told TheCable that a vigil was ongoing when the church was attacked. He said the police are on the trail of the kidnappers and would ensure the abducted worshippers are rescued. “They were having a vigil in that church, so the kidnappers came to attack them there. They kidnapped two members of the church,” he said. “We are on their trail, we are tracing them. It is our duty to rescue those people that were abducted and we are doing everything possible to do that.” Oyeyemi advised residents to be vigilant and to inform the nearest police station whenever they intend to have events at night. “People should be more vigilant because security is everybody’s business and our people are supposed to play their own part,” he said. “We have given a statement before now that whenever you want to have a vigil, especially when it is in an isolated place, try as much as possible to inform the direct police station close to that place so that they will be having constant patrol of the area.” Meanwhile, Oluwatomisin Ehuwaojomo, the parish priest, who spoke to Daily Trust, said the kidnappers have demanded N50 million ransom from the church. He said: “When my assistant called me almost two hours after they left, the kidnappers initially refused to speak with me but on his third attempt, they spoke with me and requested for N50 million ransom. I told them that I am a servant of God and I don’t receive a salary.” The kidnapped victims are Oluwaseun Ajose, an assistant parish priest, and Dagunro Ayobami, the Sunday school teacher.
