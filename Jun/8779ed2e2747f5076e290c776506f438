Eleven of the over 50 persons abducted during an attack on a train in Kaduna, have been freed. On March 28, a train on its way from Abuja was attacked by bandits in Kaduna. Several persons were killed, dozens injured, while others were abducted. Tukur Mamu, media consultant to Ahmad Gumi, popular Islamic cleric, confirmed the release of the 11 passengers in a telephone interview. He said the abductees were released on Saturday, adding that they included six females and five males. Mamu, who is also the publisher of ‘Desert Herald’, had been involved in negotiations for the release of the victims. “Right now we are in Abuja in a military hospital with them,” he said. He listed the names of the freed persons as Jessy John, Amina Ba’aba, Mohammed (Gamba), Rashida Yusuf Busari, Hannah Ajewole, Amina Jibril, Najib Mohammed Daiharu, Gaius Gambo, Hassan Aliyu, Peace Aboy and Danjuma Sa’idu. When contacted, Abdulfatai Jimoh, chairman of the group of relatives of the abducted victims, said he had read the report and was expecting official confirmation from the government. He, however, confirmed that Mamu had been involved in negotiation efforts for the release of the victims. “I just read the report. We have not heard any official information from the government yet,” Jimoh said. A total of 63 persons were abducted during the attack. Among the abductees included Alwan Hassan, acting managing director/chief executive officer of the Bank of Agriculture (BOA), who regained his freedom after nine days in captivity.
