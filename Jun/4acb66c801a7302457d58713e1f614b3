Nigeria’s Golden Eaglets have qualified for the semi-final of the ongoing WAFU B Under-17 Championship in Cape Coast, Ghana. The Nduka Ugbade-led boys secured the qualification after defeating Togo 3-1 on Tuesday. Nigeria had earlier defeated Ghana 4-2 and sublimely added another three points against the Togolese to ensure they finished top of Group A. The Eaglets were relentless against Togo and consistently showed they were hungry for maximum points. The pressure paid off in the 10th minute as Kevwe Iyede beat Komlan Ignace Kiti, Togo goalkeeper, for Nigeria’s first goal of the game. Tonye Williams, the team’s captain, added the second in the 22nd minute, as Nigeria cruised into the half-time break with a two-goal cushion. The Togolese, however, responded with measured fierceness in the second half, as they reduced the deficit in the 75th minute with a well-taken goal. Nigeria thereafter restored dominance after Light Eke struck with nine minutes to go to ensure no eleventh-hour comeback would be possible for the Togolese. With six points in two games, Nigeria have advanced to the next round, while Ghana and Togo will now meet on Thursday to decide who finishes second in the group. The two teams that make it to the final of this year’s WAFU B regional tournament will qualify for the 2023 U-17 AFCON in Algeria. The top four teams from the continental championship will proceed to represent Africa at the U-17 World Cup in Peru.
