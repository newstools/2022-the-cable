Kingsley Fanwo, commissioner for information in Kogi, has commended Bola Tinubu, presidential candidate of the All Progressives Congress (APC), for his visit to Yahaya Bello, governor of Kogi. Tinubu had, on Friday, visited Bello in Abuja. During the visit, the Kogi governor, who also contested the APC presidential ticket, donated his campaign office to Tinubu. Speaking on the development in a statement, Fanwo said Tinubu is laying the right groundwork to ensure victory for the APC in the 2023 elections. “Our presidential flagbearer has shown he is the master of the game by visiting all the key leaders of the party, especially the presidential aspirants to make them see reasons why they need to work together to deliver victory for the party,” he said “No single individual is capable of winning a presidential poll in Nigeria without the support of the party leaders and followers. Therefore, the move by Asiwaju Tinubu will instill confidence in all the stakeholders and party members to rally behind him ahead of the poll. “Governor Yahaya Bello remains a committed party man who will continue to give his best to the party. He has demonstrated that by helping the party deliver many victories in the past and 2023 will not be a difference. “He followed his conviction and our conviction by contesting for the ticket of the party. It is not a war against anyone and he has since congratulated the winner. It is time to work for the party and he will surely give his all for the party he has helped nurture into greatness over the years. “His courage and strength will be needed by the All Progressives Congress to mobilise the youth, women and people with special abilities across the country. He remains the star boy of the APC.” Fanwo also urged other party leaders to work towards reconciling members to ensure that the “locusts of yesteryears have no place again in Nigeria’s political landscape”.
