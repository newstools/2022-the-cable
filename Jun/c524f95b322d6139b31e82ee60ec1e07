President Muhammadu Buhari says Nigerians must ensure that the 2023 elections are peaceful in honour of MKO Abiola, the presumed winner of the 1993 presidential election. In his June 12 commemoration speech, the president said Nigerians must all work together to ensure a smooth transition when his tenure elapses. Buhari said he is delighted about the conduct of the presidential primaries across all political parties, adding that this momentum must be sustained in the general election. He asked candidates in the election to be fair and ensure dignity in their dealings with opponents. “It is important for all of us to remember that June 12th, 2023 will be exactly 30 years from the 1993 Presidential elections,” he said. “In honour and memory of one of our national heroes for democracy, Chief M.K.O Abiola, GCFR, we must all work together to ensure this transition is done in a peaceful manner “As we move into the general election campaign season, we must sustain this mature attitude to campaigning and ultimately, voting. We must never see it as a “do or die” affair. We must all remember democracy is about the will of the majority. There must be winners and losers.”
