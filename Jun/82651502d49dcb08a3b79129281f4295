The police command in Enugu says two of its officers have died from bullet wounds sustained in a duel with gunmen in the state. In a statement on Saturday, Daniel Nduke, the command’s spokesman, said the officers were attacked on Thursday while on duty at Nkpamte community of Igbo-Eze north LGA. “At about 12 noon of June 2, 2022, yet-to-be-identified gunmen attacked and fatally wounded two policemen, at Nkpamte community of Igbo-Eze North LGA, after a gunfight,” he said. “The police officers were immediately moved to the hospital but were unfortunately confirmed dead by doctors on duty.” The police spokesman said an investigation and a manhunt for the gunmen has commenced. “The command will further communicate development on the matter,” he added. In the past five months, several police officers have been killed by gunmen in the state. In January, two persons were killed after gunmen invaded the headquarters of the All Progressives Congress (APC) in the state. The incident happened about two months after a female officer was abducted in an attack on the police divisional headquarters in Umulokpa, Uzo-Uwani LGA of the state. Four police officers were killed in another attack along Amaechi-Ekeotu-Agbani road in Enugu south LGA.
