Also with the Rivers governor is Okezie Ikpeazu, governor of Abia. The Rivers governor’s trip to Turkey comes weeks after he participated in the presidential primary — Atiku Abubakar, former vice-president, polled 371 votes and was declared the winner of the primary, while Wike, his closest challenger, secured 237 votes. Wike was also said to be among choice candidates for the vice-presidential slot of the PDP, but Abubakar chose Ifeanyi Okowa, governor of Delta.
