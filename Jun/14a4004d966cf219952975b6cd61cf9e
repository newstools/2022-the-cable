Gerard Pique, the Barcelona defender, and Colombian pop star Shakira have announced their decision to split. Shakira and Pique have been together for 11 years and they have two children together. Their relationship came under intense scrutiny following recent reports of infidelity by Pique. The infidelity rumours were reported by El Periodico, a Spanish news outlet. Pique, 35, was said to have been romantically involved with a student who also doubles as a hostess. The couple’s split was announced through a joint statement released by Shakira’s public relations firm, stating they are separating for the well-being of their children. “We regret to confirm that we are separating,” the statement reads. “For the well-being of our children, who are our highest priority, we ask that you respect our privacy. “Thank you for your understanding.” Shakira met the Barcelona defender and Manchester United academy graduate during promotional tours for the 2010 World Cup.
