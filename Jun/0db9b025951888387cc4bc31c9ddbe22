Members of the Islamic State in West Africa Province (ISWAP) have reportedly killed 25 scavengers, otherwise known as ‘Yan Ajakuta’, in Dikwa LGA of Borno state. The scavengers were reportedly killed in Mukdala village, located about 10 kilometres north to Dikwa town on Wednesday. The victims were reportedly shot by insurgents who rode on six motorcycles. Takno Ibrahim, a member of a civilian joint task force in the state, said the deceased were shot multiple times. Ibrahim said some of the victims escaped with bullet wounds and were taken to the General Hospital in Dikwa town by officers of the military and task force. A witness, who spoke on the condition of anonymity, said he was on the farm when he heard the sounds of motorcycles from a distance. The witness said he quickly hid in the bush before he started hearing sounds of gunshots from a distance. “It was later that I discovered that they killed a lot of people,” he said. The development comes days after 32 people were reportedly killed in an attack on four communities in Kajuru LGA of Kaduna state. According to Awemi Maisamari, president of Adara Development Association in Kaduna, the corpses of the victims were found in the bushes on Wednesday.
