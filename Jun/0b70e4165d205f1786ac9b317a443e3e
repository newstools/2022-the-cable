Gunmen suspected to be members of the Indigenous People of Biafra (IPOB) have reportedly bombed the Izombe market in Oguta LGA of Imo state. According to Daily Sun, the gunmen had invaded the market on Monday, warning traders against defying the sit-at-home order. However, the traders reportedly defied the warning and went about their activities in the market. The development was said to have angered the gunmen, leading to the attack. The gunmen reportedly set two vehicles ablaze, causing commotion in the market while traders and customers scampered for safety. The newspaper quoted a witness as saying the gunmen later threw an improvised explosive device into the market. Several people were said to have been injured in the chaos. “They came and threw a local bomb inside the market, everybody started running for safety, they pour fuel on two vehicles and everywhere was in flame,” the witness was quoted as saying. Since the formation of Eastern Security Network (ESN) by IPOB, there has been a spike in attacks against security, government infrastructure, and residents in the zone. The attacks have been linked to IPOB, but the group has repeatedly denied involvement. Although the proscribed group had suspended the Monday sit-at-home, many residents still observe the order out of fear.
