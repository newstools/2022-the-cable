The Nigerian army says it has begun the court-martial of six soldiers for alleged indiscipline and other related offences at the 82 division in Enugu. The soldiers, whose names were not mentioned, are said to be between the ranks of corporal and lance corporal. Taoreed Lagbaja, general officer commanding (GOC) of the division, spoke with NAN while inaugurating the general court martial on Wednesday in Enugu. The GOC said the court martial is meant to instil general discipline in the army. Lagbaja said it is also meant to punish erring personnel and serve as a deterrent for others not to engage in acts of indiscipline. He described it as an internal mechanism of the army to put its personnel in check. “It leads the Nigerian army to be a professional and a well-disciplined force. It also builds and upholds regimentation and all ethics of the force,” he said. “The general court-martial is recognised by the country’s law and constitution.” The GOC urged the panel of the court martial to ensure expeditious justice delivery “since justice delayed is justice denied”. He also asked the panel not to sacrifice sound judgment and justice on the altar of speedy justice delivery. The eight-man panel for the general court-martial is headed by Dickson Igbokwe, a colonel.
