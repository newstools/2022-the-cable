Omoyele Sowore, human rights activist, has won the presidential ticket of the African Action Congress (AAC) unchallenged. Sowore was affirmed as the party’s presidential candidate at the AAC convention that took place in the federal capital territory (FCT) on Thursday. The activist will be up against Bola Tinubu, APC standard-bearer, Atiku Abubakar, PDP presidential candidate; Peter Obi, Labour Party presidential candidate, and others in the 2023 elections. Before the party’s convention commenced, Sowore stepped down from his position as chairman of the party he played a key role in founding. Last week, the court of appeal in Abuja affirmed Sowore as the substantive chairman of the AAC. In May 2019, the AAC reportedly suspended Sowore, who was the presidential candidate of the party in the 2019 elections, as well as Malcolm Fabiyi, who was deputy national chairman. In July 2019, a federal high court in Abuja, presided over by Inyang Ekwo, ruled against the activist who appealed that decision which declared Leonard Nzenwa as the acting chairman of the party was ill-conceived. The appellate court set aside the judgment of the lower court recognising Leonard as acting chairman and awarded N200,000 as damages in favour of Sowore.
