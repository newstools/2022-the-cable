Jose Peseiro has named a 27-man squad for his first set of competitive games in his role as the head coach of the Super Eagles. The list was unveiled in a statement released by the Nigeria Football Federation (NFF) in the early hours of Saturday. Peseiro made several changes to the squad that lost to both Mexico and Ecuador during the just-concluded US tour, revitalising the team for the 2023 Africa Cup of Nations (AFCON) qualification matches against Sierra Leone and Sao Tome and Principe. Victor Osimhen returns to the team after being left out of the tour alongside Ahmed Musa, who pulled out at the last minute. The list also shaved down the number of the Nigeria Professional Football League (NPFL) players included in the side that played the international friendlies. Only Adewale Adeyinka of Akwa United and Kastina United’s Sani Faisal got the nod as Joe Aribo and Alex Iwobi maintained their team positions. Sadiq Umar, who recently gained promotion to La Liga with UD Almeria, also made the list alongside the duo of Cyriel Dessers and Terem Moffi, which led the Eagles’ attack on the US tour. Nigeria will host the Leone Stars at the MKO Abiola National Stadium, Abuja, on June 9 before travelling to Agadir in Morroco to face Sao Tome four days later.
