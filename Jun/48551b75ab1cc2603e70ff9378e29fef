Yahaya Bello, governor of Kogi state, says his bid for the All Progressives Congress (APC) presidential ticket has proved to politicians that the youth, women and persons with disabilities (PWDs) have a voice. Bello said this on Sunday at a reception held for him in Lokoja, Kogi capital. The governor said he gained some lessons in participating in the process, adding that if Kogi APC wants to actualise its dream of producing a young president, it must ensure that Bola Tinubu, presidential candidate, wins in 2023. “Kogi state is for APC, APC is for Kogi state,” Bello said. “The way we did it in 2015 and repeated similar steps in 2019 for President Muhammadu Buhari, we must do it again in 2023 for Bola Ahmed Tinubu to emerge as the president of the federal republic of Nigeria. “We are going to give a number that has never been scored in the history of Kogi state. “We will deliver in Kogi by mobilizing the women and the youth to ensure the victory of the party’s candidate, while we ensure that the opportunity remains open for us in subsequent times.”
