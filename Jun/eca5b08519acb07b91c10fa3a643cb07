Rotimi Akeredolu, governor of Ondo state, says the All Progressives Congress (APC) should give its presidential ticket to the south to retain power in 2023. The special convention of the party to pick a presidential candidate is scheduled for June 6. The Ondo governor was named as chairman of security and compliance for the convention. In a Facebook post on Thursday, Akeredolu said he and his colleagues at the Southern Nigeria Governors’ Forum believe that power should be zoned to the south. “APC must work to retain power. We must rotate power to retain power. Rotate to the south. Shikena (finish),” the Ondo governor said. It is speculated that the APC may pick a northern presidential candidate following the decision of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) to elect former Vice-President Atiku Abubakar as its presidential candidate. Senate President Ahmad Lawan is said to be among the strong contenders for APC’s ticket. Atiku and Lawan are both from the north-east.
