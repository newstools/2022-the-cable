The Lagos state government has inaugurated an anti-okada squad to join the police in enforcing the ban in the six LGAs and highways, major roads and bridges. According to NAN, Frederic Oladeinde, commissioner for transport, said this in a statement on Tuesday. Recently, Babajide Sanwo-Olu, governor of Lagos, announced a ban on okada operations in six LGAs of the state, which took effect on June 1. Local government areas affected by the ban include Ikeja, Surulere, Eti Osa, Lagos Mainland, Lagos Island and Apapa. The directive was announced some days after some commercial motorcyclists lynched a sound engineer identified as David Imoh in the Lekki axis of the state. According to the statement, speaking at the inaugural ceremony on Tuesday, Olaseinde said the squad would reinforce the ban on commercial motorcycles in the six LGAs and nine local council development areas and would be reporting to the police. Oladeinde asked residents to collaborate with the government to combat their menace. “It is the responsibility of the public to report any nefarious activities of the squad to the Ministry of Transportation,” he said. ”The public can report through the following help/complaint lines: 09038208154, 09034810153, 09033090826 and 09169655855. “Such reports will help the government generate feedback on strategies for the protection of lives and property. “Individuals arrested (i.e. riders and passengers) will be made to face the full wrath of the law in line with the provision of Section 46, sub-section 1, 2 & 3 of the Transport Sector Reform Law (TSRL), 2018.” The commissioner also reiterated that impounded motorcycles would be crushed in public.
