The Taliban government in Afghanistan has banned females from participating in large gatherings organised to address issues of national unity. Abdul Salam Hanafi, Afghanistan’s acting deputy prime minister, on Wednesday, said the gathering, the first of its kind since the Taliban took over in August 2021, would start on Thursday. When asked if women would attend, Hanafi said male delegates would represent women. “The women are our mothers, sisters, we respect them a lot, when their sons are in the gathering it means they are also involved, in a way, in the gathering,” he said. “Different people with different views are going to gather. This will be a positive step for stability in Afghanistan and strengthening national unity.’’ Hanafi said religious leaders had asked for the gathering to address an Islamic system of government, as well as economic and social issues. Civil society groups have said the meeting will lack legitimacy if women are not included. Since coming into power, the Taliban have introduced stringent and restrictive regulations, with women and girls affected the most. Women were, in May 2022, asked to wear head-to-toe clothing when in public places and they are also not allowed to board domestic or international flights without a male chaperone.
