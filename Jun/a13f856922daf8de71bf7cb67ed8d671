A federal high court in Abuja has fixed August 29 to deliver judgment in the extradition suit filed by the attorney-general of the federation (AGF) against Abba Kyari, suspended deputy commissioner of police (DCP). Inyang Ekwo fixed the date after counsel for the parties in the suit adopted their processes and presented their arguments in the matter. Kyari is wanted in the United States over alleged conspiracy to commit wire fraud, money laundering and identity theft. A grand jury had on April 29, 2021, filed an indictment against him with the approval of the US district court for the Central District of California, after which a warrant was issued for his arrest. In July 2021, the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) indicted Kyari in a $1.1 million fraud involving Hushpuppi, the self-confessed international fraudster. The suspended police officer denied the allegation, claiming that his “hands are clean”. In August 2021, Usman Baba, inspector-general of police, received the report of a panel set up to probe the allegation against the officer. The report was thereafter sent to the AGF who then filed an extradition application against Kyari on March 2. Kyari is also standing trial before a federal high court over allegations of drug trafficking.
