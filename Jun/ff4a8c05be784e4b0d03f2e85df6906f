The Kaduna State Universal Basic Education Board (KADSUBEB) says it has sacked 2,357 teachers for failing a competency test. A total of 30,000 teachers across the state were said to have taken part in the competency test. Hauwa Mohammed, spokesperson of the board, in a statement on Sunday, said teachers who scored below 40 percent in the test were no longer required and their appointments were terminated. “Following the state government’s resolution for continued assessment of teachers to ensure better delivery of learning outcomes for pupils, KADSUBEB conducted another competency test for the teachers in December 2021,” NAN quoted her as saying. “The services of teachers who scored below 40 per cent are no longer required and their appointments have been terminated from the Public Service for their poor performances. “Teachers who scored 75 per cent and above were recognised as those who passed the test and qualified for attending courses in leadership and school management. “The training programmes will be conducted during end of term vacation and in their respective schools, to minimise disruptions of teaching and learning. “They are also encouraged to complement the government’s efforts and seek personal development for their own good. “The board is assuring teachers and the public that it remains committed to ensuring their continuous professional development and the improvement of the learning outcomes of pupils and students.”
