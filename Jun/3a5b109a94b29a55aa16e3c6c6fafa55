Former President Olusegun Obasanjo has asked Nigerian youth not to abandon the country to “those who are messing it up”. Speaking on Saturday in Abeokuta, Ogun state capital, at an event tagged “OBJ @85 Free Keke Programme”, the former president told the youth in attendance to hold their future in their hands with a firm belief that “today is our day”, as against the famous cliché that youths are the leaders of tomorrow. Obasanjo said despite many challenges confronting Nigeria, there are “opportunities galore” and asked the youths to take advantage of it. He also charged them to roll up their sleeves and make necessary contributions towards addressing the challenges of the nation. “The first thing we want to prove is that there are opportunities galore in this country. Yes, things are not what they should be but you, as youths, individually and collectively, must make up your mind, make contributions in order to make things the way they should be,” Obasanjo said. “If you leave things to those who are messing it up for you and who are saying you are the leaders of tomorrow, you will never have that tomorrow. Today is your day. “Then the third point is; yes, sometime you may get people who would help you, and at times you may not even get who would help you; you must remember God has given you innate ability to be what He wants you to be. And if you make up your mind on what you want to be, God will help you and He would provide those people who would help you to reach the sky which should be your limit.” During the programme, 85 tricycles, popular known as keke, were distributed to youth beneficiaries as part of the activities marking the former president’s 85th birthday. The tricycles were donated through the Youth Development Centre of the Olusegun Obasanjo Presidential Library (OOPL) with beneficiaries drawn from the 36 states of the country and the federal capital territory (FCT), Abuja. <img class="alignnone wp-image-710958" src="https://f5p3e9e4.stackpathcdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/IMG_20220611_173608-1024x571.jpg" alt="" width="600" height="334" srcset="https://f5p3e9e4.stackpathcdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/IMG_20220611_173608-1024x571.jpg 1024w, https://f5p3e9e4.stackpathcdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/IMG_20220611_173608-300x167.jpg 300w, https://f5p3e9e4.stackpathcdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/IMG_20220611_173608-768x428.jpg 768w, https://f5p3e9e4.stackpathcdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/IMG_20220611_173608-24x13.jpg 24w, https://f5p3e9e4.stackpathcdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/IMG_20220611_173608-36x20.jpg 36w, https://f5p3e9e4.stackpathcdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/IMG_20220611_173608-48x27.jpg 48w, https://f5p3e9e4.stackpathcdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/IMG_20220611_173608.jpg 1028w" sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" /> Bisi Kolapo, chairperson of the centre, encouraged the youth to emulate Obasanjo’s passion and commitment to build “Nigeria of our dreams”. Kolapo also warned them against corruption and greed, saying it would be difficult to fight those menaces if one is a culprit. Bashir Alimodu and Asembe Ngumimi, two of the beneficiaries respectively from Borno and Benue states, applauded the centre for the donation, which they said would enhance growth and development of their trades.
