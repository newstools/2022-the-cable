Troops of the Nigerian Army have reportedly rescued another abducted Chibok girl — with a male child. The abductee, identified as Ruth Bitrus, was among the over 200 female students abducted by insurgents from Government Girls’ Seconday School (GGSS) in Chibok in 2014. TheCable had earlier reported that the troops of the 202 battalion and 82 division task force battalion rescued two Chibok girls with two children on June 16. According to Zagazola Makama, a counter-insurgency expert, an intelligence officer confirmed that Ruth and her son were rescued by the troops of 21 army armoured brigade Bama on June 29. Ruth was said to have escaped from the Boko Haram enclave in Bama LGA of Borno state. Recounting her experience, Ruth reportedly said the father of her son was killed by a bomb while attempting to plant it against the troops of operation Hadin Kai. She added that some girls are still with the insurgents in Sambisa forest. “It took me three days to escape from the insurgents’ enclaves,” she was quoted as saying. “I took some food with me for my child. Some of the Boko Haram saw me while I was coming out but I ran to the bush to avoid being arrested.” The development comes amid efforts of troops of operation Hadin Kai to tackle insurgency in the north-east.
