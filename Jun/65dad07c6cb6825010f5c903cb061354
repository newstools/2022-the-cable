Falalu Bello, the national chairman, said delegates from the 36 states and the federal capital territory (FCT) voted for the aspirants from their respective states. “We want to make the whole process nearer to the delegates. The delegates are in the states. So that is why we decided that the primary election will take place in the 36 states and the FCT,” he said. “Definitely, having it in the states, rather than bringing them here, is more convenient for them. “We set up 37 committees headed by the nominees from the national executive committee in the states along with the state organising secretaries to conduct this exercise in the states.” Bello added that all the presidential hopefuls had resolved to support whoever is elected as the party’s candidate.
