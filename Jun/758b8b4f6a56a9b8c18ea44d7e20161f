The Federal Competition and Consumer Protection Commission (FCCPC) has advised unmetered electricity consumers to track their bills to avoid discrepancies with distribution companies. The commission said this on Sunday in a post on its social media pages. It advised electricity consumers to always check their monthly bills for tariff bands (expected hours of the daily power supply), to avoid being shortchanged. “Here is how to avoid being shortchanged: Check your monthly bill for your tariff bands and the expected hours of daily power supply. You can contest your tariff band if your supply falls short of the required hours over a 60-day cycle,” the statement reads. “Check the NERC amended order on capping of estimated bills for your distribution company, and ensure your estimated consumption does not exceed the stipulated cap for your area. “Find out the price per kWh of your electricity from your monthly bill. Your bill is calculated by multiplying the estimated energy by the current tariff plus a 7.5 percent VAT “If you find any discrepancy in your bill, complain in writing to your distribution company. “If your complaint is not addressed satisfactorily by your distribution company, escalate it to the NERC Forum Office in your area or the FCCPC.” The agency also advised consumers to escalate their complaints to NERC or the commission if they were not addressed satisfactorily by the distribution companies.
