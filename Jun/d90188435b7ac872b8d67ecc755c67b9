David Umahi, governor of Ebonyi, says the state will vote for the All Progressives Congress (APC) and not the Labour Party (LP) in the 2023 presidential election. While Bola Tinubu, a former Lagos governor, is the presidential candidate of the APC, Peter Obi, a former governor of Anambra, is that of the LP. Recently, Obi has been gaining momentum in the south-east after defecting from the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP). Umahi contested the ruling party’s presidential ticket but lost out to Tinubu after polling 38 votes. The Ebonyi governor has since accused APC delegates in the south-east of selling their votes. Speaking at the swearing-in of new commissioners and aides at the government house in Abakaliki, Ebonyi capital, Umahi said the states that LP has helped should vote for Obi. “Our party is APC and not the Labour Party. We will not vote for the Labour Party. We will vote for APC,” he said. “The states that the Labour Party has helped should vote for them. “The agenda of God for Ebonyi state is Ebonyi state agenda and that is what you should be telling them when they come to ask you, will you vote for. Tell them not to look for our votes, our votes belong to APC.” The governor also expressed dismay that the state is not recording high registration of voters. “It is very unfortunate that the different local government areas in the state are yet to witness high turnout of voters’ registration in the state, apart from Afikpo south that has so far registered over 71,000 voters, others are yet to make any meaningful impact,” he said.
