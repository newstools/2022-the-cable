An unconfirmed number of persons have been killed following an attack by gunmen on communites in Ohaukwu LGA of Ebonyi state. Chris Anyanwu, spokesman of the Ebonyi police command, said the attack occurred on Monday. Confirming the development in Abakaliki, the Ebonyi capital, on Tuesday, Anyanwu said the incident occurred at Ojiogu and Okpochiri Ukwagba Ngbo communities. The police spokesman, however, did not give an exact number of casualties recorded as a result of the attack. “Yes, we have some details. It happened yesterday, Monday. Two houses and one shop were burnt. Two motorcycles and one tricycle were also burnt by the hoodlums,” he said. “The DPO in the area said there are a few dead bodies seen on the ground. The police are working round the clock to ensure the restoration of peace in the area.” On his part, Clement Odah, executive chairman, Ohaukwu LGA, condemned the incident. He, however, gave the assurance that efforts would be intensified to unravel the circumstances that led to “such unwarranted attack and loss of lives and properties”.
