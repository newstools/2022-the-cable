Ike Ekweremadu, former deputy senate president, had in December 2021, written a letter to the British high commission about a kidney donation for his daughter. This is according to a copy of a letter to the UK high commission, seen by TheCable on Thursday. In the letter, the former deputy senate president said he was writing in support of a visa applicant who was scheduled for “medical investigations for a kidney donation to Ms Sonia Ekweremadu”. He said the donor and his daughter “will be at the Royal Free Hospital London”, adding that he would “be providing the necessary funding”. “I have enclosed a statement of my bank account,” he added. “Please do not hesitate to contact me if you require additional information. Please accept the assurances of my highest regards.” On Thursday, the UK metropolitan police announced that Ekweremadu and his wife were charged to court over the allegation of bringing a child to the UK for organ harvesting. The duo were said to have been charged following an investigation by the police’ specialist crime team. The police added that the investigation was launched after detectives were alerted to potential offences under modern slavery legislation in May 2022. “Beatrice Nwanneka Ekweremadu, 55 (10.9.66) of Nigeria is charged with conspiracy to arrange/facilitate travel of another person with a view to exploitation, namely organ harvesting,” a statement by the police reads. “Ike Ekweremadu, 60 (12.05.62) of Nigeria is charged with conspiracy to arrange/facilitate travel of another person with a view to exploitation, namely organ harvesting.” The child was said to have “been safeguarded”, while the police added that its operatives “are working closely with partners on continued support”. The couple appeared before Uxbridge magistrates’ court on Thursday, but were denied bail and remanded in custody. The case has been adjourned till July 7.
