Oluwaseun Aderogba, the Anglican bishop of Jebba diocese in Kwara, as well as his wife and driver, have regained freedom after spending over 24 hours in captivity. The trio were abducted by gunmen on Sunday along the Oyo-Ogbomoso expressway. Adewale Osifeso, police spokesman in Oyo, confirmed the release of the abductees to NAN on Tuesday. Osifeso said police operatives of the command, around 6:20pm on Tuesday, safely rescued the victims. He said investigation is ongoing to apprehend the perpetrators, while the victims have been reunited with their families. The police spokesman added that the deployment of tactical teams put the abductors under pressure, which resulted in the safe rescue of the victims. Meanwhile, the development comes amid attacks on clerics in recent months. On Monday, the Plateau police command confirmed the abduction of James Kantoma, chairman of the Jos east chapter of the Christian Association of Nigeria (CAN). Kantoma is also the parish priest of St. Anthony Catholic Church in Jos East LGA. On May 29, Samuel Kanu, prelate of the Methodist Church Nigeria (MCN), Dennis Mark, the bishop of Owerri, as well as another cleric were abducted by gunmen along the Enugu-Port Harcourt expressway in Umunneochi LGA of Abia state. The Methodist prelate and the two other clerics were later released hours after their abduction, and after reportedly paying ransom of N100 million.
