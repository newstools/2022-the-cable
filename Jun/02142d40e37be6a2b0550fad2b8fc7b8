It is pertinent to note that in 2021, we paid over N1.9 billion in claims, with a Claims Ratio of 22% — one of the best, if not the best, in the entire insurance industry”, he said. He then commended the regulator, NAICOM, for providing the right kind of oversight required to deepen, grow, and sustain the industry stating that their diligent approval processes, especially their insistence on prudence, probity, and best practice, have continued to help the company .Also speaking, the Vice-Chairman, Noor Takaful Insurance Limited, Aminu Tukur, stated that the surplus distribution comes as the redemption of its pledge to policyholders noting that Takaful insurance has become highly receptive among Nigerians over the last few years. Tukur assured stakeholders that the company would continue to provide innovation and leadership in the Takaful Insurance industry while maintaining the highest ethical and professional standards. In her remarks, the Managing Director, Lotus Capital Limited, Hajara Adeola, stated that Takaful insurance, a non-interest finance,  remains the best alternative insurance for the generality of Nigerians as it helps to promote financial inclusion. “The tenets of non-interest finance should attract anyone and should not offend anyone. It means being fair, avoiding ambiguity in the contract, avoiding gambling and many other businesses that are considered harmful to the society”, Adeola said. She commended Noor Takaful for their diligence in deepening the penetration of insurance and non-interest finance in Nigeria. “Non-interest finance such as Takaful insurance is a positive force spreading across the globe, empowering people, communities and building cities. It is a financial model that is simple, elegant, and emphasizes justice, fairness, and transparency,” she added. In his goodwill message, the Senior Pastor, The Covenant Nation, Poju Oyemade, commended the management of Noor Takaful Insurance Limited for keeping to their promises by giving out surplus payments to all participants. “What I heard here today is something I have not heard anywhere or in any organization regarding insurance. It also signifies that this organization will last a very long time. What kills many organizations is the inability to listen to feedback. So, when you have an organization with good listening and deep consideration for the people, you are bound to have a compassionate side to their business approach. I want to congratulate the organization and look forward to a more fruitful business endeavor”, Oyemade said. The event was attended by stakeholders, including regulators and relevant professional bodies such as NIA, CIIN and CIFM. Participants, including individuals, private and public organizations, banks, and higher institutions of learning, received this surplus payment. Some of the customers who received surplus distribution include Lotus Capital Limited, Jaiz Bank Plc, Sterling Bank Plc, Vanguard Pharmacy ltd, Ansar-Ud-Deen Society of Nigeria, Federal Polytechnic Ilaro, Inverness Wealth Management, Global Synergy Limited, and Crescent Schools. <img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-715940" src="https://f5p3e9e4.stackpathcdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/NT-Pix-2-1-1.jpg" alt="" width="550" height="364" srcset="https://f5p3e9e4.stackpathcdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/NT-Pix-2-1-1.jpg 550w, https://f5p3e9e4.stackpathcdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/NT-Pix-2-1-1-300x199.jpg 300w, https://f5p3e9e4.stackpathcdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/NT-Pix-2-1-1-24x16.jpg 24w, https://f5p3e9e4.stackpathcdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/NT-Pix-2-1-1-36x24.jpg 36w, https://f5p3e9e4.stackpathcdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/NT-Pix-2-1-1-48x32.jpg 48w" sizes="(max-width: 550px) 100vw, 550px" /> <img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-715941" src="https://f5p3e9e4.stackpathcdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/NT-Pix-2-3-1.jpg" alt="" width="550" height="364" srcset="https://f5p3e9e4.stackpathcdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/NT-Pix-2-3-1.jpg 550w, https://f5p3e9e4.stackpathcdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/NT-Pix-2-3-1-300x199.jpg 300w, https://f5p3e9e4.stackpathcdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/NT-Pix-2-3-1-24x16.jpg 24w, https://f5p3e9e4.stackpathcdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/NT-Pix-2-3-1-36x24.jpg 36w, https://f5p3e9e4.stackpathcdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/NT-Pix-2-3-1-48x32.jpg 48w" sizes="(max-width: 550px) 100vw, 550px" /> <img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-715942" src="https://f5p3e9e4.stackpathcdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/TGP_0878-2.jpg" alt="" width="550" height="366" srcset="https://f5p3e9e4.stackpathcdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/TGP_0878-2.jpg 550w, https://f5p3e9e4.stackpathcdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/TGP_0878-2-300x200.jpg 300w, https://f5p3e9e4.stackpathcdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/TGP_0878-2-24x16.jpg 24w, https://f5p3e9e4.stackpathcdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/TGP_0878-2-36x24.jpg 36w, https://f5p3e9e4.stackpathcdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/TGP_0878-2-48x32.jpg 48w" sizes="(max-width: 550px) 100vw, 550px" /> <img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-715943" src="https://f5p3e9e4.stackpathcdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/TGP_0965-1.jpg" alt="" width="550" height="366" srcset="https://f5p3e9e4.stackpathcdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/TGP_0965-1.jpg 550w, https://f5p3e9e4.stackpathcdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/TGP_0965-1-300x200.jpg 300w, https://f5p3e9e4.stackpathcdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/TGP_0965-1-24x16.jpg 24w, https://f5p3e9e4.stackpathcdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/TGP_0965-1-36x24.jpg 36w, https://f5p3e9e4.stackpathcdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/TGP_0965-1-48x32.jpg 48w" sizes="(max-width: 550px) 100vw, 550px" /> <img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-715944" src="https://f5p3e9e4.stackpathcdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/TGP_1076-1.jpg" alt="" width="550" height="366" srcset="https://f5p3e9e4.stackpathcdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/TGP_1076-1.jpg 550w, https://f5p3e9e4.stackpathcdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/TGP_1076-1-300x200.jpg 300w, https://f5p3e9e4.stackpathcdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/TGP_1076-1-24x16.jpg 24w, https://f5p3e9e4.stackpathcdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/TGP_1076-1-36x24.jpg 36w, https://f5p3e9e4.stackpathcdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/TGP_1076-1-48x32.jpg 48w" sizes="(max-width: 550px) 100vw, 550px" />
