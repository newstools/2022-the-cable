Going up against fellow finalists; Precious Dozi, Teddy, Fozter, Thello, Erena Blaq, Zez, King Jahvid, he earned his crown in a stimulating final battle with Barelyanyhook. The faceoff between PDSTRN and Barelyanyhook for the title in the final round had both rappers tapping deeper into their creativity. It was evidently a hard call for the judges to make, as both talents gave a worthy final battle. PDSTRN could barely contain his excitement at his win: “I’m so elated… I am grateful for being in this position right now. Shout out to Hennessy, it’s so crazy what they are doing for the culture and I hope they continue to do it to the end of time, cos rappers out here need that”. <img class="alignnone wp-image-716129" src="https://f5p3e9e4.stackpathcdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/FL-4981-scaled.jpg" alt="" width="550" height="825" srcset="https://f5p3e9e4.stackpathcdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/FL-4981-scaled.jpg 1707w, https://f5p3e9e4.stackpathcdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/FL-4981-200x300.jpg 200w, https://f5p3e9e4.stackpathcdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/FL-4981-683x1024.jpg 683w, https://f5p3e9e4.stackpathcdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/FL-4981-768x1152.jpg 768w, https://f5p3e9e4.stackpathcdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/FL-4981-1024x1536.jpg 1024w, https://f5p3e9e4.stackpathcdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/FL-4981-1365x2048.jpg 1365w, https://f5p3e9e4.stackpathcdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/FL-4981-16x24.jpg 16w, https://f5p3e9e4.stackpathcdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/FL-4981-24x36.jpg 24w, https://f5p3e9e4.stackpathcdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/FL-4981-32x48.jpg 32w" sizes="(max-width: 550px) 100vw, 550px" /> Deeply rooted in urban culture, Hennessy reaffirms its commitment to discovering and incubating talented and budding Hip Hop stars with the Hennessy Artistry VS Class platform.
