The Zamfara government says it has secured the release of over 3,000 kidnap victims from 2019 to date. Ibrahim Dosara, the commissioner for information, spoke on Tuesday in Gusau while reviewing the progress of security operations in the state. He said the victims regained their freedom through the peace, reconciliation and dialogue programme initiated by the administration of Bello Matawalle, governor of the state. The commissioner described the feat as one of the remarkable achievements recorded by Matawalle’s administration. “Before Matawalle’s administration, the state faced serious security challenges, especially attacks on our communities and kidnapping,” he said. “After taking over as governor of the state, Matawalle initiated peace, reconciliation and dialogue with bandits. “The dialogue yielded positive results because the state is recording relative peace.” According to Dosara, banditry activities have reduced to a minimal level across the state. He said the state witnessed nine months without recording bandits’ attacks at the initial stage of the dialogue. He said the government successfully rescued different groups of kidnapped victims, comprising males, females and children, and that some of them hailed from Katsina and Sokoto states. Dosara said a number of repented bandits have surrendered to the authorities while many bandit camps have been destroyed since the beginning of the peace dialogue programme. He said many roads closed due to banditry have been opened for public transportation, adding that the 14 LGAs are accessible by roads. He urged the people of the state to cooperate with government and security agencies to end banditry and security challenges bedevilling the state.
