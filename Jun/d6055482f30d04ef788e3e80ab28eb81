Anambra State government has announced the commencement of biometrics enumeration and registration of all transport companies, organizations and operators in the state. This was disclosed in a statement by the Anambra State Internal Revenue Service, AiRS, and signed by Sylvia Tochukwu Ngige, Deputy Director/Head, Taxpayer Education and Enlightenment Team on behalf of the chairman. According to the statement, the exercise which is in conjunction with OneID, a subsidiary of Appmart integrated limited, “is in line with Governor Charles Soludo’s vision to nip the recent security challenges of the State in the bud”. Those involved include operatives of Shuttle Buses, Try-Cycle otherwise known as Keke, Trucks including Mini-Trucks, Tippers, Lorries and Taxis. The exercise which started on Thursdays, June 2, 2022, will take place at designated ports to be communicated through union executives. The statement mandated all stakeholders to comply within four weeks from June 2, 2022. It warned that “failure to comply attracts impoundment.” Anambra State has been under terror attacks from “unknown gunmen”, with hundreds of residents killed, scores of houses, police stations, government offices, and vehicles set ablaze, and thousands displaced from their ancestral homes within the last one year. In most cases of the incidents, the attackers invade with unregistered vehicles.
