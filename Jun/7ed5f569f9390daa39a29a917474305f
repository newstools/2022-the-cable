The Kogi state house of assembly has impeached four principal officers and suspended three others for “undue gross misconduct”. According to NAN, the decision was announced on Friday during an emergency sitting at the assembly complex, following the adoption of a motion raised by Enema Paul, lawmaker representing Dekina II. According to the motion, the four principal officers were accused of gross misconduct. “We, the undersigned honourable members of the Kogi State House of Assembly, do hereby resolve to impeach the following principal officers,” the motion reads. The impeached officers were listed as Ahmed Mohammed, deputy speaker; Bello Hassan Abdullahi, majority leader; Ndako Idris, deputy majority leader; and Edoko Ododo, deputy chief whip. After the impeachment, Paul, in his contribution, called for their replacement, adding that the house could not afford a vacuum. He said the officers should be replaced pending the outcome of investigation into their alleged misdemeanour. The lawmakers, therefore, replaced the impeached principal officers with Rabiu Alfa as deputy speaker, Bajeh Mukhtar as majority leader, Umar Isa as deputy majority leader, and Enema Paul, deputy chief whip. In an earlier ruling on the motion, Matthew Kolawole, the assembly’s speaker, asked if the 17 members actually signed the impeachment and suspension document and they answered in affirmation. Kolawole then directed the clerk of the house to call out the new principal officers, who were immediately approved. The legislators also dissolved the standing committees and constituted new ones to “upscale performance of their oversight functions in the remaining lifespan of the assembly in the state”.
