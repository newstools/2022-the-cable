Christopher Onotu, a Catholic priest, was on Saturday, abducted by gunmen in Obangede, Okehi LGA of Kogi state. The gunmen reportedly broke into the priest’s rectory on Saturday night before whisking him away. The congregation got to know about the priest’s abduction on Sunday morning when they went to attend morning mass. Williams Ayah, police public relations (PPRO), confirmed the development to TheCable on Monday morning. The police said a manhunt has been launched to ensure the kidnappers are apprehended and the victim rescued. “The commissioner has already deployed personnel,” he said. “A manhunt has been launched for the perpetrators to be arrested. We are collaborating with the military, the Department of State Services (DSS) and other security agencies to ensure the man’s release.” Priests are increasingly being targeted by gunmen across the country. In March, gunmen killed two people and abducted Joseph Aketeh, a catholic priest, a woman and two children in Kaduna. Weeks ago, Joseph Bako, a Catholic priest who was abducted from his residence at St John Catholic Church, Kudenda, Kaduna, was found dead. Onotu’s abduction also comes days after two persons were killed and many injured in an explosion that occurred during an annual festival in Okene LGA of Kogi state.
