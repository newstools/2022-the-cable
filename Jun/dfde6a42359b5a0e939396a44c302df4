SystemSpecs Technology, a subsidiary of SystemSpecs, says an intelligent and committed workforce is essential for corporate organisations to overcome challenges. Demola Igbalajobi, managing director of SystemSpecs Technology, said this while receiving students and staff of Covenant University at the company’s office in Lagos. According to a statement, Igbalajobi said intelligent, committed employees of good character have played a huge role in helping the company overcome various challenges in its 30 years of existence. “Our challenges have changed over time as we develop. However, getting intelligent, committed staff and people of good character has helped us in overcoming various challenges over the past three decades,” Igbalajobi said. “Our recruitment process is rigorous so that we can get the brightest of the brightest. Sound character and ethics are also important to us. “At SystemSpecs, we desire people who are not only creative but also have a strong desire to create positive change in the society.” The company said the students were exposed to core human resource management (HRM) practice and were provided insights into how the profession works with technology. Also speaking during the visit, Odunayo Salau, head, industrial and HRM unit, Covenant University, who is also leader of the team, said they had more insight on the need to adopt a strategic approach in HRM. “This academic visit has given us some exposure to how HRM practices can best be implemented. Now we are seeing the need to move from the conventional way of doing things to a strategic approach,” he said. “We can see the inevitability of technology in the practice of HRM, reflected in technology solutions such as the enterprise resource programme (ERP), which I think every organisation should have.” SystemSpecs is a provider of financial, human capital management, and e-commerce technology solutions.
