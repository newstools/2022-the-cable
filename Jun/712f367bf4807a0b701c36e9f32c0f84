President Muhammadu Buhari will attend an extraordinary summit of the Economic Community of West African States (ECOWAS) authority of heads of state and government on Saturday. On Friday, Buhari returned to Abuja after a two-day visit to Spain. He had travelled to the European country shortly after a meeting with governors of the All Progressives Congress (APC) on the party’s forthcoming presidential primaries. The summit, which will be held at the presidential palace, Accra, Ghana, will assess the political situation in Mali and other parts of West Africa. The attendants are expected to review progress made by Mali’s military junta on the return of the country to democratic rule. The leaders will also review the situation in the Republic of Burkina Faso and the Republic of Guinea. Buhari will be accompanied by Geoffrey Onyeama, minister of foreign affairs; Babagana Monguno, national security adviser, and Ahmed Rufa’i Abubakar, director-general, National Intelligence Agency (NIA). He will return to Abuja the same day after the summit.
