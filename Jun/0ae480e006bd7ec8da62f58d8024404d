A federal high court in Abuja has convicted two persons linked to the drug trafficking case involving Abba Kyari, suspended deputy commissioner of police (DCP). Kyari was on March 7, arraigned alongside Sunday Ubia, Bawa James, Simon Agirigba and John Nuhu who are members of the police Intelligence Response Team (IRT). Others are Chibunna Patrick Umeibe and Emeka Alphonsus Ezenwanne — two drug traffickers who were arrested at Akanu Ibiam International Airport, Enugu. In the charge marked FHC/ABJ/57/2022, the agency accused the defendants of conspiracy, obstruction and dealing in cocaine worth 17.55 kilograms. Upon arraignment, Kyari and four other defendants pleaded not guilty. However, Umeibe and Ezenwanne, the sixth and seventh defendants pleaded guilty and begged the court to “have mercy”. At the resumed hearing on Tuesday, Sunday Joseph, counsel for the NDLEA, informed the court that two motions seeking for a plea bargain in respect of the two defendants had been filed. Other defendants did not oppose the application for a plea bargain. Delivering ruling, Emeka Nwite, the judge, convicted the two defendants and sentenced them to two years’ imprisonment each on counts 5, 6 and 7. The judge, however, held that the jail terms will run concurrently starting from the day the NDLEA arrested the defendants.
