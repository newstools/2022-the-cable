Ahmad Usman, a 30-year-old member of a vigilante group, was killed on Saturday afternoon in the Lugbe area of Abuja for alleged blasphemy. The deceased, said to be a Muslim, was accused of insulting Prophet Muhammad while arresting offenders of market regulations. He was said to have been a member of the security group guarding the Timber market at the Federal Housing Estate, Lugbe. TheCable understands that after he was beaten and stoned to the point of losing consciousness, he was set on fire by the mob. This is the third reported incident of mob action over alleged blasphemy in the country in less than one month. On May 12, Deborah Emmanuel, a student of Shehu Shagari College of Education, Sokoto, was murdered over alleged blasphemy. Videos of the late student being stoned and beaten with sticks were shared on social media. Her killing had sparked outrage across the country, with Nigerians asking the government to fish out the perpetrators of the crime. A few days later, Naomi Goni, a student in Borno state, was alleged to have made a blasphemous statement against the Prophet Muhammed on her Facebook page. The development had resulted in calls for the Borno state government to intervene in the matter, with some youths threatening to take action. Similarly, on May 21, a pastor was reportedly injured in an attack in the Katangan area of Warji LG of Bauchi over an alleged case of blasphemy.
