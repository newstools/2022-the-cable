Abubakar acknowledged the sports minister’s foresight in drawing up laudable initiatives like the adopt-a-pitch programme which led to the Public-Private Partnership (PPP) arrangement with Aliko Dangote for the rehabilitation of the Abuja stadium after it was abandoned for more than a decade. According to the statement, the National Stadium Surulere, Lagos and the Obafemi Awolowo Stadium, Ibadan are currently at advanced stages of rehabilitation.
