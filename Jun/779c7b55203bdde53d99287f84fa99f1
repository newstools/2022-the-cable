Isa Burji, zonal chairman of the All Progressives Congress (APC) in Jigawa central, is dead. Burji reportedly slumped and died at a hotel in Abuja. Abdullahi Ango, chairman of APC Jigawa east, confirmed the development at the Eagle Square, venue of the APC special convention, on Tuesday. According to Ango, the deceased died at about 3.30pm on Tuesday, shortly before he was scheduled to attend the convention. He described the death as sudden, saying “the deceased had his lunch and had performed his afternoon prayers”. “He had no known history of any ailment. He just slumped and died instantly,” Ango said. The Jigawa APC leader, however, dismissed reports that Burji died at Eagle Square. Ango described the late Burji as a ‘’good and honest person”. “He was the leader of the Jigawa delegation until he died,” he said “May the Almighty Allah repose his soul and grant him Aljannat Firdaus.”
