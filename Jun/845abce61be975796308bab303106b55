Gani Adams, the Aare Ona Kakanfo of Yorubaland, has asked the United Nations (UN) to intervene in Nigeria’s security challenges. In a letter titled, ‘Avoiding a Replica of the Bosnian War in Nigeria’, and addressed to Antonio Guterres, UN secretary-general, Adams said insecurity in Nigeria could have a significant impact on Africa if nothing urgent is done to address it. The letter was also addressed to the African Union (AU), United States (US), the International Association for Religious Freedom, United Kingdom, Council on Foreign Relations and other international organisations. “As you and hundreds of millions of people globally are aware, things are no longer normal in Nigeria. Dangerous and despicable things are happening in the world’s most populous black nation,” the letter reads. “Pitiably, terrorists moving from northern Nigeria to the south are being embraced, encouraged and empowered by powers that be in Nigeria. “I am raising this alarm now because the effect of this dangerous trend may ultimately balkanise Nigeria and affect sub-Sahara Africa.” Aside from the security challenges, Adams also cited the recent killing of Deborah Samuel in Sokoto over alleged blasphemy, as well as the recent abduction of clerics. “It is generally believed that those in authority are helpless, complicit or both. Now, Nigeria is at the point of no return, showing all signs of a failed nation,” he said. “No part of Nigeria is safe again. The time for the United Nations to escalate this danger to a global concern is now.”
