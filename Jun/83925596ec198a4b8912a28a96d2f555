A group identified as the south-east front in the All Progressives Congress (APC) has urged delegates to choose Senate President Ahmad Lawan as the party’s presidential candidate. In a statement on Wednesday, the group said choosing a presidential ticket from the north-east will be a good match against Atiku Abubakar, candidate of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP). “It has become apparent that PDP has once again laid ambush for our party the APC by choosing its candidate from the north-east instead of the south-east,” the group said. “We believe that this is compelling and still within the confines of equity and fairness, considering the fact that neither north-east nor south-eastern parts of the country had produced a president in the history of our country. “With this power convolution in mind, we the people of the south-east do hereby call on our amiable President Muhamadu Buhari (GCFR), our great party, the APC, all delegates to the presidential primary election to consider and choose Senator Dr. Ahmed Lawan as the candidate of our party for the 2023 presidential election, being that the PDP has chosen its presidential candidate from the north-east zone. “It is our belief that our great APC will consider the sacrifices which the south-east has continued to make towards the development of our party and the nation in the future. “While we continue to consult and mobilise support, we urge our south-east brothers to demonstrate confidence as this is the quickest route to the primary office of the nation.” Some of the APC chieftains that signed the statement are Sam Nkire, A.C. Ude, Martins Azubuike, Bath Ugwuoke, K.C. Ugboaja, Victor Nwankwo among others.
