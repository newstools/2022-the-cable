Gani Adams, Aare Ona Kakanfo of Yorubaland, says it is against culture for a person who isn’t of Yoruba extraction to be honoured with a prominent Yoruba title. He said this on Tuesday when he paid a visit to Jimoh Olanipekun, the Ataoja of Osogbo. Although Adams did not cite any example of a non-Yoruba receiving such a title, the development comes days after Abdullahi Ganduje and his wife, Hafsat, were decorated as the Aare Fiwajoye and Yeye Aare Fiwajoye of Ibadanland. Speaking on Tuesday, Adams said giving prominent titles to non-indigenes goes against tradition and should be discouraged. He also said Yoruba people are capable of bridging security gaps in the zone through the Oodua People’s Congress, which he heads. “I am pleased to tell Kabiyesi that efforts are on to build a workable synergy between the local security and the government agencies,” he said. “We are ready to partner with the south-west governors to brace up the security architecture of the region. “Kabiyesi should help tell our traditional rulers to save our tradition from going into extinction. The idea of giving prominent Yoruba titles to the non-Yoruba is at variance with Yoruba culture and tradition.” In his remarks, the Ataoja of Osogbo, said states in the south-west need “spiritual” support to tackle security challenges affecting the zone. The monarch said he is worried by security challenges in the south-west, adding that the recent attack on the Catholic church in Owo is another reason to be more concerned. “I am happy the Aare Ona Kakanfo of Yorubaland is here and I want to appeal to him to save our land from these terrorists,” he said. “The south-west is boiling at the moment and it is only when we get ourselves prepared physically and spiritually that we can rid our region of terrorists that have invaded the region.”
