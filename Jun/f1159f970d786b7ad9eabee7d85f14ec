Sunday Dare, minister for youth and sports development, has charged Jose Peseiro, newly appointed coach of the Super Eagles, to restore the confidence of Nigerians in the team. The minister spoke at a meeting with the Portuguese tactician and some officials of the Nigerian Football Federation (NFF) on Wednesday. Last month, Peseiro was appointed as the Eagles head coach following the resignation of Austin Eguavoen from the role after the team failed to qualify for the Qatar 2022 World Cup. The Portuguese first assignment was the international friendlies against Mexico and Ecuador in the United States — both of which the team lost. During the meeting, Dare told Peseiro to build “consistency and discipline in our team, on and off the pitch, because it’s a critical criteria for success.” The minister also reminded Peseiro of some demands required of him from Nigerians, charging him to “win every game, even though it’s impossible.” “For us as a ministry and the NFF, the message we want to pass emphatically to the new coach is that this is the start of the rebuilding process. Nigeria is a football-loving nation. They love the Super Eagles, and they love to win every game, even though it’s impossible,” the minister said. “Whether it is friendly or a competitive game. Let there be consistency and discipline in our team, on and off the pitch, because it’s a critical criteria for success. “Nigerians would want to see the hunger, aggressiveness, and the commitment in the team that you lead. If you lose, it should be done gallantly with a spirited fight. You must restore the confidence of Nigerians in the Super Eagles.” Peseiro will lead the Eagles as they commence the 2023 Africa Cup of Nations (AFCON) qualifying series against Sierra Leone at the MKO Abiola National Stadium, Abuja, on June 9 before travelling to Agadir in Morroco to face Sao Tome four days later.
