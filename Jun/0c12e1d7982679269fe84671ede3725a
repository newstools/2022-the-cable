Rotimi Akeredolu, governor of Ondo, says his administration will hunt down the perpetrators of the attack on a church in the Owo LGA of the state. The St Francis Catholic Church in Owo was attacked by gunmen while the Sunday service was nearing its conclusion. Many people were killed in the attack, including children and women. The gunmen were said to have detonated explosives before firing at the worshippers. The governor described the incident as “vile and satanic”, calling it a “calculated assault” on the people of Owo. “It is a black Sunday in Owo. Our hearts are heavy. Our peace and tranquility have been attacked by the enemies of the people. This is a personal loss, an attack on our dear state,” Akeredolu said. “I have spoken to the Bishop of the Catholic Diocese of Ondo, Most Reverend Jude Arogundade, who is presently on his way to Owo. Similarly, I have had to cut short my party’s national assignment in Abuja and visit Owo immediately. “This is an unexpected development. I am shocked to say the least. Nevertheless, We shall commit every available resource to hunt down these assailants and make them pay. We shall never bow to the machinations of heartless elements in our resolve to rid our state of criminals. “I commiserate with my people in Owo, particularly families of those who lost their lives to this ugly and unfortunate attack. I extend my condolences to Olowo of Owo, Oba Gbadegesin Ogunoye as well as the Catholic Church. “I urge our people to remain calm and vigilant. Do not take laws into your hands. I have spoken to the heads of the security agencies. I have equally been assured that security operatives would be deployed to monitor and restore normalcy to Owo kingdom.”
