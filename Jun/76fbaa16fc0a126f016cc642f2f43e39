Leaders of the All Progressives Congress (APC) in the south-south say they will ensure victory for Bola Tinubu, the party’s candidate, in the 2023 election. Victor Giadom, APC national vice-chairman, south-south, said this in Abuja on Thursday, during a meeting of leaders of the party from the zone. On June 8, Tinubu polled 1,271 votes to defeat 13 other presidential hopefuls during the APC primaries held in Abuja. Giadom asked members of the party from the six south-south states to ensure Tinubu wins next year’s election. “We congratulate Asiwaju Bola Tinubu for his emergence as the presidential candidate of our party and thank him for the steps he has so far taken to unite those who contested that election with him and to assure him that the south-south zone will support his ticket and ensure his victory come 2023,” Giadom said. “The south-south zone in that direction has resolved to work with him and the party to ensure victory in the 2023 general election. “The party is determined and will do whatever it takes to ensure that Asiwaju successfully takes over from President Muhammadu Buhari after the 2023 general election. “We, therefore, urge all party members in the south-south zone to embrace the presidential ticket of our party to ensure victory in 2023.”
