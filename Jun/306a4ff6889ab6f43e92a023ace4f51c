The Nigeria Football Federation (NFF) has confirmed that the Super Falcons will play Japan in an exhibition match on October 6. The federation announced the friendly game in a statement released on Monday. Nigeria will face the 2011 FIFA Women’s World Cup winners at the Noevir Stadium, Kobe, Japan. The kick-off time is, however, yet to be announced. “Nine-time African champions and FIFA World Cup ever-present Nigeria will take on the Senior Women National Team of Japan in a prestige international friendly match at the Noevir Stadium, Kobe, on Thursday, October 6 this year. The date falls within one of the FIFA Women International Windows for this year,” the statement read. The clash will be the fourth time the two sides will be meeting, with the Japanese winning the previous three encounters. The first was at the 2004 Olympics women’s football event, where the Nadeshiko defeated the Falcons 1-0. Two back-to-back friendlies followed in 2013, which both ended with 2-0 wins for the Asians. The Falcons are billed to defend their African Women Cup of Nations (AWCON) title when the 12th edition of the tourney kicks off in Morrocco from July 2 to 23. Nigeria is in Group C alongside South Africa, Botswana, and Burundi.
