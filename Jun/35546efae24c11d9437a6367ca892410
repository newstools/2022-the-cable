Akwa United edged Plateau United 2-1 at the Godswill Akpabio Stadium on Saturday. #NPFL22 Log after today’s Results – @RiversUnitedFC Champion – @KwaraUnitedFC Continental hope dent – Relegation Battle get Tougher 3 Points separating 12 Position and 19 Position pic.twitter.com/KQ8ABRl3H0 — NPFL Insert (@NPFL_INSERT) June 25, 2022  With four games to play, Stanley Eguma’s wards are guaranteed champions courtesy of a 10-point lead over Plateau United, who have three games at hand. Should Rivers United lose all four remaining games, and the Jos-based side win all of theirs, the new champions would still be ahead by one point.
