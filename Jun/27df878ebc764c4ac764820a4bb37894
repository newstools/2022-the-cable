A Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) panel has reportedly nominated Nyesom Wike, governor of Rivers, as the running mate to Atiku Abubakar. Sources told TheCable that the panel, comprising former and serving governors, national working committee (NWC) members, and members of the board of trustees (BoT), nominated Wike at a meeting held on Tuesday. The panel was recently set up by the PDP NWC to pick a running mate for Atiku, who won the party’s presidential election. Atiku had floored Wike, Bukola Saraki, former senate president; Emmanuel Udom, Akwa Ibom governor; Bala Mohammed, Bauchi governor, among others, to clinch the PDP presidential ticket. He polled 371 votes, while Wike, his closest challenger, secured 237 votes. TheCable understands that the majority of members of the panel voted for Wike over the Akwa Ibom governor, as well as Ifeanyi Okowa, governor of Delta, who were also on the list for consideration. Meanwhile, the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) has fixed June 17 as the deadline for political parties to submit their list of candidates for — president, vice-president, senate and house of representatives — ahead of the 2023 general election. BEFORE THE CLOSED-DOOR MEETING Speaking before members of the panel went into the closed-door meeting on Tuesday, Iyorchia Ayu, national chairman of the PDP, said the party is expected to announce Atiku’s running mate within 48 hours. “I wish you a successful deliberation and I hope you come up with a conclusion between tomorrow and Friday,” he had said. The panel is expected to transmit its recommendation to the NWC which will officially announce the decision. The committee is chaired by Umar Damagum, PDP deputy national chairman (north). Members of the committee include David Mark, former senate president; Aminu Tambuwal, governor of Sokoto; Ndudi Elumelu, minority leader of the house of representatives; Samuel Ortom, governor of Benue, and Sule Lamido, former governor of Jigawa.
