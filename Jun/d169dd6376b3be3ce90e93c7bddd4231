Anosike Chimobi, identified as a suspect linked to the killing of Ahmed Gulak, a chieftain of the All Progressives Congress (APC), has spoken on how the shooting was carried out. Gulak, a former political advisor to ex-President Goodluck Jonathan, was killed on May 30, 2021 in Owerri, Imo state, on his way to the airport. He was on his way to catch a flight to Abuja after visiting the state. Speaking with journalists on Monday when the police paraded him in Owerri, Chimobi claimed to be a commercial bus driver and said some gunmen forced him to drive them to where Gulak was. The suspect said the gunmen killed the politician after he refused to give in to their demands. “Gulak’s killers approached me to convey them in my vehicle. I initially resisted, but I later gave in after they threatened to kill me,” the suspect, who is said to hail from Mbaise LGA of Imo, said. “They shot him after he resisted their demand that he should come down from the vehicle.” Speaking earlier, Mike Abattam, spokesman of the Imo police command, said officers have been on the trail of Chimobi since the Gulak killing. Abattam said the command also arrested other suspected criminals who have been “terrorising” communities in the state. According to him, members of a gang who burnt the home of George Obiozor, president-general of Ohanaeze Ndigbo, have also been arrested. Guns, ammunition, charms and a live snake recovered from the suspects were displayed during the media briefing.
