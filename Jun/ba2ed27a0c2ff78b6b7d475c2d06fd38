Idris Salman, an architect, has won the ticket of the African Democratic Congress (ADC) to contest a seat in the federal house of representatives. Salman is seeking to represent Kabba-Bunu/Ijumu federal constituency in Kogi state in the 2023 elections. Salman polled 73 votes to defeat his closest rival, Idris Rufus, who got four votes. The victory comes after Salman dumped the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) after losing the ticket at the party’s primary held on May 23. Salman had earlier contested the same position in 2019, but lost. Shola Samuel, the returning officer, while announcing the result on Thursday, commended the ADC delegates and party supporters for their orderly conduct. While speaking on his victory at the primary, the architect said he hopes to positively impact the lives of the people of the constituency. He further appreciated leaders and stakeholders of the ADC for entrusting him with the party’s ticket, adding that he will not betray their trust.
