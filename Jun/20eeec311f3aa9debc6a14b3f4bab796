The federal capital territory administration (FCTA) says commercial motorcycle operators, locally known as ‘okada’ riders, now need to obtain a licence to operate within the city and its suburbs. Bello Abdullateef, director of the directorate of road transport service (DRTS), FCTA, said this on Thursday during a media briefing organised by the presidential communication team at the presidential villa, Abuja. Abdullateef said that aside from traffic violations, the riders were also being used to deliver hard drugs across the city. “The menace arising from many okada riders is not just about traffic violations but also perpetration of crime. Okada is also used to deliver hard drugs across the city,” he said. “It requires a multi-sectoral approach to deal with the menace. We are introducing riders certification for those using okada for dispatch activities. “Therefore, until you are verified by the directorate of road transport service, you may not be able to ride a bike across Abuja. We are remodelling the licensing and regulations as well. “These would be carried out to dissuade the use of okada. Total ban has been suggested but it is still being considered. “Some of the contiguous states are already banning. And if we don’t ban it, FCT will be a dumping ground in a few years.” Recently, Babajide Sanwo-Olu, governor of Lagos, announced a ban on okada operations in six LGAs of the state, which took effect on June 1. Local government areas affected by the ban include Ikeja, Surulere, Eti Osa, Lagos Mainland, Lagos Island and Apapa. The directive was announced some days after some commercial motorcyclists lynched a sound engineer identified as David Imoh in the Lekki axis of the state.
