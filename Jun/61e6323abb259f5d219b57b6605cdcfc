This episode is about Lagos, the centre of excellence, and how Lagosians learn street smartness from sour experiences. You can say Lasgidi is a “very good bad guy”. It is the centre of opportunities and possibilities, and indeed, anything and everything is possible in Lagos. From the embarrassing insults from bus conductors to the pickpocketers at the famous ‘Ikeja under bridge’, you have no choice but to always be on alert. Jam Jam recounts how she resorted to “fronting” her backpack after her phone was stolen while The Honourable narrates how he was once swindled at Lagos Island.
