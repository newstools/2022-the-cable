The federal government says Nigeria Air, the country’s proposed national carrier, would receive the Air Transport Licence (ATL) on Monday. The federal ministry of aviation, in a tweet via its official page on Sunday, said the Nigerian Civil Aviation Authority (NCAA) is expected to present the ATL to the airline’s interim management. An ATL is issued as authorisation to airlines to provide scheduled and non-scheduled services. It is also one of the licences received by airlines before they can commence operation, while they wait for the Air Operator Certificate (AOC) that fully guarantees them the right to begin air services. The federal government said the presentation would be done at NCAA’s headquarters in Abuja. The @NigerianCAA will on Monday, June 6th 2022 present the Air Transport License (ATL) to the interim management of the #NigeriaAir, Nigeria's national carrier at the NCAA's Corporate headquarters, Nnamdi Azikiwe International Airport, Abuja.#AviationNG pic.twitter.com/xe6i2kEyFt — Federal Ministry of Aviation, Nigeria (@fmaviationng) June 5, 2022  “The @NigerianCAA will on Monday, June 6th, 2022 present the Air Transport License (ATL) to the interim management of the #NigeriaAir, Nigeria’s national carrier at the NCAA’s Corporate headquarters, Nnamdi Azikiwe International Airport, Abuja,” the tweet reads. Nigeria Air Limited, in March 2022, applied to NCAA for a licence to operate scheduled and non-scheduled passenger and cargo services. In November 2021, Hadi Sirika, minister of aviation, announced that the proposed national carrier would take off in April 2022, adding that the airline would begin operations with three wet-leased aircraft. The proposed airline, which was opened for bidding to both private and public investors, is expected to run smoothly without undue government interference by the minister.
