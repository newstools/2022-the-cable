Bisi Kolawole, the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) governorship candidate in Ekiti, says he is impressed with the preparedness of the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC), for the election. INEC is currently conducting a governorship election across the 16 LGAs in Ekiti. Speaking to NAN after casting his vote on Saturday, Kolawole said the process was peaceful, but if security operatives notice any form of chaos, they should not hesitate to arrest perpetrators. “I want to tell you that there are enough security men on ground to ensure peace, but if there is any chaos, I believe the security should be held responsible,” he said. “We are not saying security men should rig the election for anybody, but I want them to do their jobs without favouritism or being partisan. “So far, so good, I have just finished casting my vote, I think INEC’s preparation for this election is commendable. However, I will urge INEC to continue to improve.”
