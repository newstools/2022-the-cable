Tahir Lawan, a consultant pediatrician with Nizamiye Hospital Abuja, has advised parents to take their children for health checks annually. He said the culture of parents taking their children to the hospital only when they are sick should be discontinued as they should be encouraged to take them for regular checks. “When it comes to helping your child live a happy, healthy life, yearly checkups are crucial. Unfortunately, many parents avoid taking their children to the doctor if they are not sick, which causes problems in the long run,” he said. “Bringing your child in for regular checkups helps doctors understand what is normal for your child so that illnesses can be diagnosed easily.” He added that checkups for children help the pediatrician conduct a comprehensive review of the child’s physical, emotional, and developmental well-being. “It also allows parents to raise questions and concerns regarding their child’s health. From toilet training to learning problems, from social issues to healthy eating concerns, all these issues and topics can best be addressed instead of a sick visit when the focus is the illness,” he said. Lawan, therefore, advised parents to imbibe the habit of scheduling yearly checkups for their children as it offers a wide range of benefits, including protection from illnesses, spotting developmental problems early, and tracking growth.
