Bisi Kolawole, the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) governorship candidate in Ekiti, says it is cheap blackmail to say he is the stooge of Ayo Fayose, former governor of the state. Prior to the party primary, Kolawole was endorsed by Fayose, who described him as the “bridge-builder who will usher in a better future in the state”. Following the endorsement, Kolawole edged out Segun Oni, a former governor of the state, to clinch the party’s ticket. Speaking on Sunday during a debate organised by Channels TV, Kolawole said he does not have any regrets about being endorsed by Fayose. On whether Fayose would determine the affairs of Ekiti, Kolawole said the former governor is only an experienced person guiding him, and would not be involved in running the state. “I’ve been the only candidate that has worked with four governors in Ekiti state. I was a supervising councilor years back when Niyi Adebayo was the governor. I was in the house of assembly when my brother, Segun Oni, was governor,” he said. “When he left, governor Fayemi came in and I had six months with governor Fayemi, and governor Fayose appointed me as the commissioner for environment. He must have considered my antecedents; he must have considered my track record over the years that this is a competent person he can trust to pilot the affairs of the state based on all the experience I’ve had. “We can seek the advice of previous governors, not only governor Fayose. The idea of being a stooge is just cheap blackmail. Somebody that has piloted the affairs of the party, calling him a stooge will be very insulting to my person. I want to assure you, if seeking advice from experienced people makes you a stooge, let it be.”
