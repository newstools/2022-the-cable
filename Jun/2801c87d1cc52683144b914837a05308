The Lagos police command says its operatives have arrested two herders over the alleged murder of a bus conductor in Age-Mowo area of Badagry. Benjamin Hundeyin, Lagos police spokesperson, in a stagltement on Monday, said the victim was mistaken for the conductor of a bus which ran into a herd of cattle in the area. Following the alleged killing of the conductor, residents of the area blocked the highway in protest. Speaking on the development in a series of tweets, Hundeyin said the suspects are now in custody. “A commercial vehicle ran into two cows this morning at Agemowo, Badagry, killing one of the cows,” he said. “The two cattle herders attacked someone they mistook for the vehicle conductor, resulting in his death. “Angry residents blocked the highway in protest of the killing. “The DPO, Morogbo Division, assisted by soldiers from 243 Recce Battalion, Badagry, successfully cleared the obstruction.” The development comes months after the Lagos government banned open grazing of cattle in the state. In 2021, Babajide Sanwo-Olu, governor of Lagos, signed a law to prohibit open grazing of cattle in the state. The Miyetti Allah Cattle Breeders Association (MACBAN) had, however, asked for more time to train its members on how to stop the practice of open grazing.
