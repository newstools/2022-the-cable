Abdulsalami Abubakar, former head of state, says he is recovering well from knee problems which led to his cancelling activities to mark his 80th birthday. In a phone chat with TheCable on Monday evening following widespread reports that he had suffered a stroke, the retired general said he only had issues with his knee which affected his mobility. “I had a swollen knee and was unable to walk for days in the last week of May,” he told TheCable. “After initial care by my doctors, they advised that I should seek further expert care abroad. That was why I had to cancel my birthday programme. “I was on admission for a brief period but I have now been discharged while doctors do a regular follow-up. I am much better. It was not an emergency and I was not rushed to any hospital. “I appreciate the support, love and care that Nigerians have been showing since the story went on social media. I am grateful to all my friends and well-wishers.” Abdulsalami handed over to a democratically elected government in May 1999 and is seen as one of the heroes of Nigerian democracy. He has also been involved in a number of peace moves to prevent violence around elections and promote the spirit of sportsmanship. He did not put a possible date on his return to the country.
