Leaders of the All Progressives Congress (APC) in the south-west have met with presidential hopefuls from the zone ahead of the party’s presidential primary. The meeting took place on Saturday in Abuja after President Muhammadu Buhari had met with all APC presidential hopefuls. The south-west leaders’ meeting may be connected to how the zone can forge an alliance to produce the next presidential candidate of the party. On Saturday, northern APC governors had asked Buhari to look toward the southern presidential hopefuls when considering his successor. <img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-708331" src="https://f5p3e9e4.stackpathcdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/20220605_081132.jpg" alt="" width="600" height="822" /> <img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-708332" src="https://f5p3e9e4.stackpathcdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/20220605_081126.jpg" alt="" width="600" height="824" /> <img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-708333" src="https://f5p3e9e4.stackpathcdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/20220605_081122.jpg" alt="" width="600" height="683" /> <img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-708334" src="https://f5p3e9e4.stackpathcdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/20220605_081112.jpg" alt="" width="600" height="683" /> <img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-708335" src="https://f5p3e9e4.stackpathcdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/20220605_081109.jpg" alt="" width="600" height="683" /> <img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-708338" src="https://f5p3e9e4.stackpathcdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/20220605_081048.jpg" alt="" width="600" height="683" /> <img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-708339" src="https://f5p3e9e4.stackpathcdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/20220605_081100.jpg" alt="" width="600" height="683" /> <img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-708340" src="https://f5p3e9e4.stackpathcdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/20220605_081103.jpg" alt="" width="600" height="683" /> <img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-708341" src="https://f5p3e9e4.stackpathcdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/20220605_081007.jpg" alt="" width="600" height="559" /> <img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-708342" src="https://f5p3e9e4.stackpathcdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/20220605_081001.jpg" alt="" width="600" height="802" /> <img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-708344" src="https://f5p3e9e4.stackpathcdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/20220605_080956.jpg" alt="" width="600" height="565" /> <img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-708346" src="https://f5p3e9e4.stackpathcdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/20220605_080948.jpg" alt="" width="600" height="640" /> <img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-708347" src="https://f5p3e9e4.stackpathcdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/20220605_080946.jpg" alt="" width="600" height="716" /> <img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-708348" src="https://f5p3e9e4.stackpathcdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/20220605_080942.jpg" alt="" width="600" height="516" /> <img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-708349" src="https://f5p3e9e4.stackpathcdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/20220605_080939.jpg" alt="" width="600" height="873" />
