Kaduna state government says it has discussed with a top FIFA and the Confederation of African Football (CAF) official on establishing a 5-a-side football league. Idris Nyam, the state’s commissioner for sports development, spoke about the partnership on Wednesday while inaugurating the local organising committee (LOC) for the upcoming league. He said the competition titled “Croc City 5-a-side Football For Peace League” has gotten the approval of Isha Johansen, a member of FIFA’s council, who “has confirmed her interest to partner and visit Kaduna state officially, in the company of other FIFA, CAF and NFF executives.’’ The commissioner also said the delegation would look into the implementation of the ‘FIFA for schools’ initiative, which aims to impact 700 million children globally. Nyam added that the upcoming event will be the 2nd edition of the competition. The first edition was held between October 4 to November 14, 2021, at the Ahmed Musa Neighbourhood Centre, Kaduna. The commissioner said the league was held “with 32 teams, 320 players participating, five referees, 64 match officials, an estimated 2,500 spectators and cash prizes worth N2,000,000 won.” He said this year’s edition “is designed on a larger scale to include 150 participating teams across the three senatorial districts.” Photo credit: Furnturf Nigeria
