The Nigerian Navy says it confiscated crude oil and other illegally-refined products worth N2.7 billion in a week. In a statement, Adedotun Ayo-Vaughan, director of information, naval headquarters, said the feat was achieved by troops deployed for “Operation Dakatar Da Barawo”. “The various NN platforms deployed for ‘Operation Dakatar Da Barawo, Calm Waters 11’ and Tripartite Joint Border Patrol have continued to sustain aggressive patrols to curb the menace of crude oil theft and illegal oil bunkering,” he said. “Accordingly, several Illegal Refining Sites (IRS), metal storage tanks, wooden boats, dugout pits and ovens were destroyed between June 13 and June 19.” He said five suspects were arrested and the operatives destroyed 14 illegal refining sites. He also said 80 storage tanks, 22 wooden boats, 40 ovens, two speed boats, a tanker, truck, barge and a Toyota Sienna were recovered during the various operations. The navy spokesman said the Navy ship ‘VICTORY’ in Cross River intercepted and impounded three wooden boats laden with drums of suspected illegally-refined petrol (PMS) around Ikang channel, suspected to be transported to Cameroon. He said the boats as well as the products have been taken into custody. “Forward Operating Base (FOB) Bonny in Rivers also intercepted two wooden boats laden with about 400,000 litres of suspected stolen crude oil at Iwokiri,” Ayo-Vaughan said. He said the wooden boats and products were destroyed. He said in Bayelsa, the navy intercepted a wooden boat laden with about 60,000 litres of illegally-refined AGO, and that they were also destroyed.
