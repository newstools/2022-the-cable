Ayo Fayose, former governor of Ekiti state, has demanded that a southerner must succeed President Muhammadu Buhari in 2023. Fayose is a member of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) and Atiku Abubakar — a northerner — is the presidential candidate of the party. The former Ekiti governor was one of the presidential hopefuls who contested the primary of the opposition party. In a tweet posted on Wednesday, Fayose said it is the turn of the southern region to produce a president. “The PDP Constitution provides for a rotational Presidency. Section 3(c) provides that the Party shall pursue its aims & objectives by adhering to the policy of the rotation & zoning of Party & Public elective offices in pursuance of the principle of equity, justice and fairness,” he wrote. “The current President of Nigeria is a 2-term Northern Presidency, thus implying that it MUST be a Southern Presidency in 2023 or NOTHING.” Writing in Yoruba language, Fayose also tweeted that “awa south lo kan” — which means “it is the turn of the south”. The remark is a reference to the catchphrase attributed to Bola Tinubu, the presidential candidate of the All Progressives Congress (APC). The current President of Nigeria is a 2-term Northern Presidency, thus implying that it MUST be a Southern Presidency in 2023 or NOTHING.            Awa ‘South’ lo kan’. Nigerians should await details soon. — Peter Ayodele Fayose (@GovAyoFayose) June 29, 2022  The former governor added that Nigerians should “await details soon”. At the PDP presidential primary, Fayose was unable to secure the mandate of the 16 Ekiti delegates — and as such, he secured no vote.
