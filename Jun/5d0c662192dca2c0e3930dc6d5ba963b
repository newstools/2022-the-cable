Bola Tinubu, presidential candidate of the All Progressives Congress (APC), says he “would have been a little upset” with Senate President Ahmad Lawan over the latter’s decision to contest the party’s ticket. The former Lagos governor garnered 1,271 votes to defeat 13 other presidential hopefuls — Lawan secured 151 votes. Speaking on Wednesday after he was announced as the winner of the presidential primary by Atiku Bagudu, chairman of the election committee, Tinubu thanked Vice-President Yemi Osinbajo and Lawan for their contribution to the party and nation-building. To Lawan, however, Tinubu said he would have been upset with him, but said he would leave the senate president to “lick his wounds”. “The vice-president, a very good and supportive pillar, a good associate to the president of the Federal Republic of Nigeria, Professor Yemi Osinbajo. We thank you for being steady and good support to our president,” he said. “To you the legislator, Senate President Ahmad Lawan, I would have been a little upset because you competed with me. But that is over now, since you can easily lick your wounds. “It doesn’t take away from thanking you for the past cooperation, collaboration and coolheadedness to build our country. You have helped to steer the ship of this nation in the right direction and with your team in the senate, history is written and will be kind to you. “To my brother, Gbajabiamila, the sparkling speaking speaker, I credit you for being ever-ready to do Nigerians’ work and build the nation.”
