Yahaya Bello, governor of Kogi state, says he will still contest the presidency in the near future. Bello spoke on Wednesday, while fielding questions from state house correspondents in Abuja after visiting President Muhammadu Buhari. The governor paid a visit to Buhari to thank him for his support on participating in the APC presidential primary election. Bola Tinubu, former governor of Lagos, won the ticket after securing 1,271 votes, while the Kogi governor polled 47 votes. Bello said what he did with the APC presidential race was to “test the mic”, adding that his next attempt will be “supersonic”. He appealed to his supporters not to be “disillusioned”, as “sometimes you win some, and sometimes you lose some in life”. He urged his supporters to support the ruling party in the coming elections. On the possibility of Tinubu, the APC presidential candidate, settling for a Muslim as his running mate, Bello said religion or zone should not be the determinant for political offices. He said whether a Muslim/Muslim or Christian/Christian ticket, the major consideration for selection should be the ability to deliver.
