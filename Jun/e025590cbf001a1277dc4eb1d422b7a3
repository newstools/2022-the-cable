A high court in Akure, Ondo state has sentenced three persons to death for killing Funke Olakunrin, daughter of Reuben Fasoranti, a leader of Afenifere, the Yoruba socio-political group. Olakunrin, who was 58 years old, was heading for Lagos from Akure, Ondo state capital, when suspected kidnappers targeted her vehicle in July 2019. In an attempt to escape, the attackers fired at her, and she died while being taken to hospital. Frank Mba, force public relations officer, had announced that four suspects were arrested over the killing of Olakunrin. Mohammed Usman, Mazaje Lawal, Adamu Adamu and Auwalu Abubakar were arraigned on eight counts bordering on conspiracy, kidnapping, murder, armed robbery, unlawful possession of firearms and aiding and abetting. Delivering judgment on Friday, Williams Olamide, the judge, convicted three out of the four suspects. Usman, Lawal and Adamu were sentenced to death. The judge held that the prosecution proved its case beyond a reasonable doubt. However, the fourth suspect, Abubakar, who was on trial for aiding and abetting the crime, was discharged and acquitted by the court.
