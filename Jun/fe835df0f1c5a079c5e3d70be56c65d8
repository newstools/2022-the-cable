Taiwo Awoniyi, Super Eagles striker, has joined Nottingham Forest, a newly-promoted English Premier League (EPL) side, for a club record fee of £17 million. The Nigerian joined the English club from Union Berlin FC of Germany. Forest announced the deal in a statement posted on its website on Saturday. The 24-year-old penned a five-year deal that would see him play at the City Ground until 2027. “Nottingham Forest is delighted to confirm the signing of Nigerian international forward Taiwo Awoniyi for a club-record fee,” the statement reads. “The 24-year-old joins The Reds from Bundesliga club Union Berlin, signing a five-year deal at The City Ground. “Awoniyi becomes Forest’s first international signing since last month’s promotion to the Premier League and he joins following an excellent season in Germany, scoring 20 goals in 43 games across all competitions. “His 15 goals in 31 Bundesliga matches also helped Union Berlin secure a fifth-place finish and qualification for the UEFA Europa League for the first time since 2001-02.” Speaking on the move, the Ilorin-born striker expressed his excitement at the fulfilment of his dream of playing in the EPL. “I’m very excited to be here at Nottingham Forest,” he said. “It’s always been my dream to play in the Premier League and having spoken to Steve Cooper about our ambitions and looking at Forest, with its great history, it’s a club that I want to be part of.” Awoniyi was part of the Golden Eaglets side that won the 2013 U-17 World Cup in the United Arab Emirates. In 2015, he was signed by Liverpool but could not get hold of first-team football and endured multiple loan spells at FSV Frankfurt, NEC, Mouscron, Gent and Mainz 05. He joined Union Berlin on loan during the 2020/21 season and made the move permanent last July.
