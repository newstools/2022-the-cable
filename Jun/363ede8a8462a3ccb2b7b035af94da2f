The senate has confirmed seven persons nominated by President Muhammadu Buhari for ministerial positions. The upper legislative chamber confirmed the nominees on Wednesday after they were screened by the “committee of the whole” chaired by Senate President Ahmad Lawan. The ministers-designate will replace those who resigned to pursue political bids. Rotimi Amaechi, Ogbonnaya Onu, Godswill Akpabio and Emeka Nwajiuba are some of the ministers who resigned to pursue presidential bids. The ministers confirmed on Wednesday are Henry Ikoh (Abia), Umana Okon Umana (Akwa Ibom), Ekuma Joseph (Ebonyi), Goodluck Nana Obia (Imo), Umar Ibrahim Yakub (Kano), Ademola Adewole Adegorioye (Ondo), and Odo Udi (Rivers). During screening, Ikoh said as a way of tackling employment in the country, “technical” graduates can be job creators. “On the unemployment situation, we need more technical graduates to do most of the things we are doing right now. If you are a technical graduate, you can employ yourself and employ others,” he said. On his part, Umana said the country could boost its foreign exchange earnings with its free trade zones. “On the issue of how to boost foreign exchange, I want to say that even the free zones platform is a veritable platform for this,” he said. “The free zone is a platform that can drive production because when you produce for export, you earn foreign exchange.” Nakama said the federal government must be ready to make some compromise to end the strike by the Academic Staff Union of Universities (ASUU). “On tackling the issue of ASUU, my answer is that there will be leave of compromise. Government and ASUU will have to come to a compromise and through this, we will able to solve these incessant strikes once and for all,” he said. The remaining four nominees were asked to “take a bow and go” on the grounds of their experience.
