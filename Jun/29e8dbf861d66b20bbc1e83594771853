The federal government has asked Nigerians to submit their input on the draft rules for online platforms made available to the public on June 13. This was made known on Thursday in a statement signed by Hadiza Umar, head of corporate affairs and external relations at the National Information Technology Development Agency (NITDA). The agency had issued a code of practice for all online platforms operating in Nigeria, otherwise known as the ‘Code of Conduct for Interactive Computer Platforms/Internet Intermediaries’. The code of practice was said to have been developed with input received from online platforms including Twitter, Facebook, WhatsApp, Instagram, and Google, among others. According to the agency, the rules will hold online platforms accountable for unlawful and harmful information on their platforms. The development had generated mixed reactions from the public and key stakeholders. TheCable reported that the Paradigm Initiative (PIN) described the code as a potential tool for the abuse of constitutionally guaranteed rights of Nigerians. Given the feedback, NITDA had called on members of the public to share their inputs and comments. The agency has now said people who are still interested in making an input should do so on or before Friday, June 24. “In furtherance of the recent press release on Draft Code of Conduct for Interactive Computer Platforms/Internet Intermediaries by the National Information Technology Development Agency (NITDA), published on 13th June, 2022 for reviews and comments from the general public,” the statement reads. “The agency wishes to thank the public for their constructive feedback this far and to remind other interested parties that are yet to provide their inputs, comments or feedback on the Draft Code of Practice to do so on or before Friday, 24th June, 2022. “The inputs, comments and feedback can be submitted via info@nitda.gov.ng.”
