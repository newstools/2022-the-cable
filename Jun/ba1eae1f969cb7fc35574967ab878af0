The development also affected the cryptocurrency as the market cap dropped from $1.27 trillion to $975.71 billion in one month. Although the crypto market is said to have been affected by the ongoing war in Ukraine, Nayib Bukele, president of El Salvador, had called for a meeting with 44 countries to discuss how digital currencies can aid financial inclusion. El Salvador, a country in South America, was the first to adopt Bitcoin as legal tender. Despite the move, the Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN) had warned and banned cryptocurrency transactions in the country. It also created the country’s own digital currency, eNaira.
