Happy bcos a northern statesman could say the truth as it is putting ethnicity & religion aside.Sad bcos as a nation we are tilted towards making d bad choice. pic.twitter.com/8qxfkybEup — Blackz (@austine_okpegwa) June 19, 2022  Di comments show say plenti social media users believe di story sotey dem even praise di pesin wey write am.   Wetin we check As TheCable check, we see say no beta media platform post di tori wey pipu claim say na di former CBN govnor write. We con askSanusi weda na him write am, he say no. “No be me write dat tori, na fake news,” na so Sanusi tell TheCable. Final Tok Di post wey dey tok about di real reason why Atiku, Tinubu and Obi wan be president no be true. No be Sanusi Lamido Sanusi write am.  Dis tori comot in partnership wit Report for the World, global service program wey dey support local public interest journalism.
