Nduka Obaigbena, publisher of THISDAY newspaper, and Kadaria Ahmed, founder of RadioNow FM, are scheduled to speak on the financial viability of the media at a conference organised by the International Centre for Investigative Reporting (ICIR). The conference is part of activities marking the 10th anniversary of ICIR. In a statement shared with TheCable, ICIR said the discussion would centre on the revitalisation of the African media space in the wake of the COVID pandemic and the effects of dwindling revenues from advertising. According to Dayo Aiyetan, founder of ICIR, “the time is now to have a conversation on the future of the media in Africa, particularly its viability and profitability”. “Many news organisations are not profitable because of dwindling sales and ad revenue. Many media companies cannot pay salaries and are laying off staff. The media in Nigeria is haemorrhaging,” he added. Tshepo Mahloele, chairman of Arena Holdings, will deliver the keynote address at the event. Other speakers include Chris Anyanwu, chief executive officer (CEO) of Hot FM; Kabir Yusuf, chief executive officer (CEO) of Daily Trust newspapers; and Abigail Ogwezzy-Ndisika, a professor of mass communication at the University of Lagos (UNILAG). Martins Oloja, managing director of Guardian Newspaper Limited, will moderate the conversation, while Eugenia Abu, a renowned TV personality, will compère the event. The conference will hold on June 22 at the Transcorp Hilton Hotel in Abuja.
