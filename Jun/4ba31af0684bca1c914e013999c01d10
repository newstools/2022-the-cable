Bala Mohammed, governor or Bauchi, has presented 60 cars to LG coordinators in the state for “outstanding performance”. In a post on his Facebook page on Sunday, the Bauchi governor said the gesture is in appreciation of the efforts of the LG coordinators. “Today, I donated 60 brand-new cars to critical stakeholders in the 20 local government areas of the state. The gesture was to appreciate their outstanding performance and tremendous support to my administration,” the post reads. “I also pledged to continue to do more even as I acknowledged the success of my administration to the support and sportsmanship of these local government coordinators.” Meanwhile, according to NAN, the governor said the cars will support campaign activities of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) in the state. “We are ready to do better. I charge you all to enter every nook and cranny of the state. We are ready to counter all the lies and false claims opponents are spreading against the party. Nobody can come and deceive our traditional rulers; nobody can come and deceive our youths and nobody can come to deceive the electorate,” he was quoted as saying.
