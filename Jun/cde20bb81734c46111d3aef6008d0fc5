Paul Enenche, senior pastor of Dunamis International Gospel Centre (DIGC), says Nigeria is in a situation where fervent prayers for divine intervention are needed. Enenche said this on Thursday during the daily ‘Early Will I Seek Thee’ morning prayers, ahead of the national healing and deliverance crusade. The cleric said the insecurity across the nation needs God’s intervention, adding that the three-day crusade is organised to seek God’s intervention for Nigeria, especially as the country prepares for the 2023 general election. “Our nation is at a junction where divine intervention is absolutely necessary,” he said. “Massive insecurity, massive instability. And then, we are at the threshold of a political process. “There is no time better than this to make demands for the help of God for a turnaround in our land. “Don’t assume that things would change by themselves. The Bible says if my people that are called by my name shall humble themselves and seek my face and turn from their wicked ways, I will hear them and heal their land. “I believe that as God heals individual and delivers individuals, he would heal the nation as well. “Therefore, I will like to invite you this evening to the FCT Sports Complex and the Old Parade Ground at Area 10 Abuja as we intercede for our nation.”
