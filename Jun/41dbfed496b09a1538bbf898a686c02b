Kashim Shettima, former governor of Borno, says it will be “catastrophic” for the All Progressives Congress (APC) if Bola Tinubu, former Lagos governor, isn’t elected as the party’s presidential candidate. He said this on Friday, while featuring on a programme on TVC. “We are in a democratic situation but I’m afraid it might be catastrophic for the party. I’m not a prophet of doom; I’m an internal optimist. We have done our own bidding and by God’s grace, our candidate will emerge as the presidential flagbearer of the APC  in the next 72 hours,” he said. “It is not a subject of dispute but a question of time. He has paid the price, and yesterday in Abeokuta, he made some remarks that were deliberately distorted and quoted out of context. “Whether they are willing to admit it or not, he played a pivotal role not only in the emergence of President Muhammadu Buhari as the candidate of the APC, but in the ultimate election in 2015.” The former Borno governor added that if Buhari will endorse any candidate, it would be Tinubu. “He is the president of this country. His input is highly essential. We respect and adore him, but we believe at the end of the day, the president is a democrat and he will align himself with the aspirations of his party members,” Shettima said. “People are underrating the president a great deal and they are equally underrating the depth of his friendship with asiwaju Bola Ahmed Tinubu. They have come a long way. The president is a man of honour who is being grossly underrated. “The President Buhari I know sufficiently, if at all the president is going to endorse anyone, that person is going to be asiwaju Bola Ahmed Tinubu. Forget about all the charlatans and distractions and political contractors.”
