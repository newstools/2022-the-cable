Femi Gbajabiamila, speaker of the house of representatives, has asked the committee on police affairs to work towards the rehabilitation of police stations across the country. Gbajabiamila mandated the committee to include funds for the renovation of police stations in the 2023 budget. The speaker gave the directive on Thursday while speaking on a motion sponsored by Manu Soro, a lawmaker from Bauchi. While moving his motion, Soro had called for the rehabilitation of police and Nigerian Security and Civil Defence Corps’ stations in Darazo/Ganjuwa federal constituency of Bauchi state. The legislator had said the police station was destroyed by Boko Haram insurgents in 2013 and has not been rehabilitated since then. Contribution to the motion, Ifeanyi Momah, a lawmaker from Anambra, also demand the rehabilitation of police stations in Ihiala — his constituency. Other lawmakers who supported the motion called for comprehensive rehabilitation of police stations across the country. While raising the issue of funding, Gbajabiamila said the police station in Soro and Ihiala should be rehabilitated through the police trust fund while the house committee on police should work towards the renovation of other police stations across the country. “The chairman of the police committee — during the next budget exercise in September/October, should include the rehabilitation of police stations across the country,” he said. The motion was unanimously adopted when it was put to a voice vote by Gbajabiamila. Security facilities, especially police stations, have been targeted by gunmen across the county, with the south-east reporting most of the attacks in recent months.
