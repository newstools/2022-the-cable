OrderPaper Advocacy Initiative will convene a national dialogue on zonal intervention projects (ZIP), popularly called constituency projects, and election campaigns for legislative positions. The discussion aims to raise public awareness of the electoral promises made by politicians seeking election to the national assembly. The event will hold on Thursday at Transcorp Hilton, Abuja and will feature a panel session comprising members of the national assembly and civil society representatives. Ladi Hamalai, former director-general of the National Institute for Legislative and Democratic Studies (NILDS), will deliver the keynote address. Guests expected at the event include Chukwuka Utazi, chairman, senate committee on communicable diseases; Ibrahim Oloriegbe, chairman, senate committee on health; and Opeyemi Bamidele, chairman, senate committee on judiciary, human rights and legal matters. Catherine Onyeka, OrderPaper’s programme associate, said the dialogue is among activities aimed at contextualising constituency projects in terms of effect and service delivery, as well as piquing and strengthening residents’ interest in participating in the execution. The event, which is supported by the John D and Catherine MacArthur Foundation and the BudgIT Foundation, will also spotlight OrderPaper’s ConsTrack civic tech tool. In line with its mandate, OrderPaper designed and deployed ConsTrack to promote citizen participation and interface with elected representatives in the choices and implementation of constituency projects across Nigeria. The objective of the mobile application is to engender inclusiveness, transparency, and accountability in the constituency project scheme.
