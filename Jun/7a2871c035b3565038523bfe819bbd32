Ekiti voters will on Saturday decide the next governor of the state in a poll that may set the tone for the 2023 general election, particularly on the performance of the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC). To succeed Kayode Fayemi as governor, 16 political parties are fielding candidates. Will Abiodun Oyebanji, the candidate of the All Progressives Congress (APC), successfully fend of the challenge by Segun Oni, former governor of the state and candidate of the Social Democratic Party (SDP), to retain the governorship for his party? Will Olabisi Kolawole, candidate of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP), pull a surprise? There will be scrutiny of INEC in terms of availability of materials, performance of technology in accreditation, timely voting, collation and announcement of results. Security agencies will also be under watch as they try to keep the peace, law and order. In text, video, audio and photo, TheCable crack team of reporters will provide blow-by-blow reporting LIVE. The team is led by Mansur Ibrahim, a veteran of election coverage who has been criss-crossing the country reporting governorship and presidential elections. Others in the team are Taiwo Adebulu, Dyepkazah Shibayan, Ebunoluwa Olafusi, James Ojo and Kunle Daramola.
