Several residents have been reportedly killed after gunmen invaded Igama communty in the Okpokwu LGA of Benue state. Buildings in the community were also said to have been razed in the attack, which occurred on Sunday. Confirming the attack to TheCable, Catherine Anene, Benue police spokesperson, said police operatives have been deployed to the area. She, however, said there was no official report yet on the number of casualties. “A team was sent to manage that incident. I have not received details of it, but I’m aware that there was an attack in Okpokwu. I want to get an official report from officers on the ground before I can talk on casualties,” she said. When asked if the police had confirmed if properties were set ablaze, she said details were yet to be provided to her office. “I don’t have that detail. They only confirmed to me that there is an attack and that they are moving in. I’m still expecting report from them.” The development comes amid a spike in attacks on Benue communites in recent months. In March, scores of persons were killed in Guma, Kwande and Gwer west LGAs of the state, when gunmen invaded communities in the areas.
