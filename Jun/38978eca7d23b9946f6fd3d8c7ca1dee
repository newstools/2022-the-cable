Salah, who also won the award in 2018, expressed his excitement at being recognized by his fellow professionals. “It’s a great honour to win a trophy,” the 29-year-old said. “Individual or collective and this one is big so, very happy and very proud of that. This one is a really good one to win, especially because it’s voted by players. “It shows you that you’ve worked really hard and you get what you worked for. I have my room with trophies in a cabinet and I made sure that I had another space for one more. I always keep space and just try to imagine that the trophies are going to come.” In a season Liverpool failed to claim the EPL title on the final day of the season, Salah scored 23 goals to finish the season as joint EPL top goal scorer and also added 14 assists.
