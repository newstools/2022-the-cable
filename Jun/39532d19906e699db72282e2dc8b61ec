Sunday Dare, minister of youth and sports development, on Tuesday, congratulated Nigeria’s U-17 men’s team for qualifying for next year’s CAF U-17 Nations Cup in Algeria. The Golden Eaglets beat the Young Elephants of Cote d’Ivoire 3-1 in the first semifinal of the WAFU B U-17 tournament in Cape Coast, Ghana. “I salute your fighting spirit and determination. I commend your coaches, officials and the Nigeria Football Federation for laying the foundation for this success,” Dare said in a statement. “I urge you to finish this assignment the same way your seniors, the Flying Eagles, did in Niamey, Niger Republic last month. Go and win the final and I know you can do it. You are great Nigerian ambassadors already and we will be waiting to receive you with the trophy after the final.” The Uduka Ugbade-inspired Nigerian cadets overcame the first-minute deficit from the penalty spot to overpower the Ivorians who are defending champions with three brilliant goals. Two of the goals came from the expertly taken free kicks by the outstanding Emmanuel Michael. Apart from securing Nigeria’s place in the WAFU B U-17 final, the Eaglets’ victory also confirmed Nigeria’s berth in Algeria’s 2023 CAF U-17 Nations Cup. The final of the WAFU B U-17 event will be played in Cape Coast, Ghana on Friday.
