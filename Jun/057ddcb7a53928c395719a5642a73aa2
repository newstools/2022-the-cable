Hadiza Balarabe, deputy governor of Kaduna, says Nasir el-Rufai, the state governor, promotes gender inclusion in his political appointments. The deputy governor said this on Wednesday, after the swearing-in of political appointees in the state. She said Kaduna is the best place in Nigeria to be a woman, as 53 percent of the state’s commissioners are women. “Women make up about 53 percent of the appointed commissioners in Kaduna state. This is undoubtedly the best in Nigeria and any sub-national in Africa,” she said. “As of now, Kaduna state is the best destination to be a woman in Nigeria. “This is the first time that a woman will be presiding over the ministry of local government affairs as its commissioner in the history of this state. Before now, it has been the special preserve of men. “Only Malam Nasir El-Rufai can easily dislodge traditionally-held positions that hold back progress and development, like the male ownership of the ministry of local government. “He has done that with so many issues since he became the governor of Kaduna state.” She also advised the female appointees not to disappoint the governor, but to help “keep the doors open for more women to come in, not only in Kaduna state but in other states of Nigeria”. “Continue to contribute to the development of our people as you have been doing. It is your previous performances that earned you these positions,” she added. The newly sworn-in appointees include: Umma K. Ahmed as commissioner for local government affairs, and Aminu Abdullahi Shagali as special adviser on political matters.
