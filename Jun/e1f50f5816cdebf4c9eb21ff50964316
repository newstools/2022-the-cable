Yakubu Ajaka, deputy national publicity secretary of the All Progressives Congress (APC), has asked Rabiu Kwankwaso, former governor of Kano, to return to the ruling party. Ajaka said Kwankwaso, presidential candidate of the New Nigeria Peoples Party (NNPP), has a better chance of becoming Nigeria’s president “in future”. Speaking with journalists in Abuja on Sunday, the deputy spokesman said the former Kano governor needs a party like the APC to achieve his ambition. “That is why I said it’s not too late for him to return to the APC,” he said. “That is where he naturally belongs and has an assurance of becoming a president one day, and not his current sectional NNPP. “Although, some people might be deceiving him by calling him Mr. President already but just one or two states in the north-west cannot make him a president. “Kwankwaso needs a national party like APC to achieve his presidential ambition. So, I plead to him to do the needful before it’s too late.” Ajaka said Peter Obi, presidential candidate of Labour Party (LP), is enjoying social media frenzy but would need the general acceptability of the country to win the election in 2023. “Just like Kwankwaso, Peter Obi is only enjoying sectional sympathy but a real presidential candidate needs to enjoy acceptability from all parts of the country,” he said. “We believe that Peter Obi should enjoy his social media frenzy for now before the real campaign starts very soon.” Ajaka said his party will defeat the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) and its presidential candidate, adding that the opposition party “cannot go beyond coming second at any election”.
