The south-west presidential hopefuls on the platform of the All Progressives Congress (APC) are expected to have a meeting today. According to The PUNCH, the meeting is scheduled for 8pm at the residence of Olusegun Osoba, former governor of Ogun state. The development comes after the APC rounded off the screening of its presidential hopefuls. On Friday, John Oyegun, chairman of the screening panel, announced that 10 aspirants out of the 23 presidential hopefuls that participated in the exercise were shortlisted from participating in its special convention to pick a standard-bearer. However, Oyegun did not mention the names of the shortlisted hopefuls. The presidential hopefuls from the south-west include Bola Tinubu, former governor of Lagos; Vice-President Yemi Osinbajo; Kayode Fayemi, governor of Ekiti, and Ibikunle Amosun, former governor of Ogun. Others are Dimeji Bankole, a former speaker of the house of representatives; Robert Borrofice, senator representing Ondo north, and Tunde Bakare, serving overseer of The Citadel Global Community Church. South-west governors are also expected to attend the meeting. Yinka Oyebode, Fayemi’s spokesman, could not confirm the news when contacted by TheCable. “I cannot confirm. I will get back to you if the meeting holds,” he said. Jubril Gawat, senior special assistant to Babajide Sanwo-Olu, Lagos governor, also said he “has no information yet on the meeting.” The APC presidential primaries will hold from June 6 to 8.
