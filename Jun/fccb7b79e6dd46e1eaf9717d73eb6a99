Although 23 presidential hopefuls were screened by the John Oyegun-led panel, two out of the 23 — Abubakar Badaru and Ken Nnamani — withdrew from the race. The Oyegun-led panel shortlisted 13 presidential hopefuls for the “safe list” while 10 of them did not make the shortlist, but the party’s national chairman clarified that no hopeful was disqualified and that the Oyegun’s categorisation is a mere “grading system”.
