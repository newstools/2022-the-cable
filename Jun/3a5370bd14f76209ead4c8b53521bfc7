There was tension at Jakande estate, located at Isolo axis of Lagos state after a pedestrian was reportedly killed in an accident. After the accident, which reportedly occurred on Thursday, a mob was said to have descended on okada riders in the estate. Many motorcycles were burnt during the chaos. Reacting to the incident in a statement, Benjamin Hundeyin, Lagos police spokesperson, said officers arrived the scene to rescue the okada rider accused of killing the pedestrian, from being lynched. “It is important to clear the air on what’s going on at Jakande Estate/Isheri Road. This morning, a motorcycle rider veered off the road and hit a pedestrian,” the Lagos police spokesperson said. “Unfortunately, the pedestrian fell and died on the spot. People around decided to lynch the motorcycle rider. The Police arrived at the scene on time and rescued the motorcycle rider from lynching. “The Police immediately took the rider to hospital for treatment and evacuated the pedestrian. Before the Police arrived back at the scene, an angry mob was already burning the motorcycles left behind by the fleeing riders. “The Lagos State Police Command condemns jungle justice in very strong terms. Anyone found engaging in such would be dealt with in accordance with the law. Meanwhile, officers are on ground and normalcy has returned to the area.” The development comes days after a ban on the operation of commercial motorcycles in six LGAs in the state took effect. LGAs affected by the ban include Ikeja, Surulere, Eti Osa, Lagos Mainland, Lagos Island and Apapa. However, Jakande estate, Isolo, is not located in the affected LGA.
