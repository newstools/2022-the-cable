A federal high court in Lagos has refused to hear the cases filed by Malcolm Omirhobo for appearing before the court dressed as a ”juju priest”. Last Thursday, Omirhobo appeared before the supreme court in the same costume. The lawyer had said he was exercising his fundamental rights following the recent verdict of the apex court which affirmed the wearing of hijab in schools. On Monday, the human rights lawyer appeared before Tijani Ringim, the judge, dressed the same way sparking reactions from some lawyers who argued he could not be heard. But Omirhobo argued that the constitution says otherwise and he could choose to appear that way. “My Lord, the rules cannot supersede the Constitution of the Federal Republic of Nigeria,” he said. After listening to his argument, Ringim directed Omirhobo to address the court on why he should be heard the way he was dressed on the next adjourned date. The court ordered that the address must not be more than five pages with authorities cited, adding that it must be filed before the adjourned date. “You cannot address the court like this as a professional. I will adjourn your matter and you come and address the court if the rules allow you to appear in court like this,” the judge said. Omirhobo’s first suit, FHC/L/CS/929/2022, was against the federal government of Nigeria and others. His second suit; FHC/L/CS/1392/2021, was against the Nigeria Army and two others. Both were not heard. The judge adjourned the hearing to October 10, 2022.
