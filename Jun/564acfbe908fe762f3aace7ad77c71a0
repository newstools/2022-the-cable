The Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) says it has extended the period for the collection of permanent voter cards (PVCs) in Osun state. The extension comes ahead of the state governorship election scheduled for July 16. In a statement on Saturday by Oluwaseun Osimosu, the commission’s public affairs officer, INEC said the extension was to ease collection of PVCs for voters. “INEC wishes to inform the public, most especially all eligible voters who are yet to collect their Permanent Voter Cards that they can collect their PVCs at the registration areas (wards) from June 22 to June 26,” the statement reads. “The collection would be between 9 a.m. and 3 p.m. daily. “Those coming for their card collection are to come with their registration slip, issued to them during registration exercise, in exchange for the PVCs.” The commission added that collection by proxy is not allowed. Osimosu also noted that “PVC collection is free”, and urged those yet to collect their voter cards to use the opportunity of the INEC extension period. The INEC official also said its policy of “no PVC, no voting” still subsists, adding that INEC would ensure that all votes count during the governorship election.
