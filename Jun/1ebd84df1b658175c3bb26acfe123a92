Our attention has been drawn to publications by Ibadan-based blogs purporting that Teslim Folarin, the governorship candidate of the All Progressives Congress (APC), has sued TheCable newspaper for N10 billion over a “libellous story”. While we await official communication from Folarin’s lawyers, we want to assure our readers and well-wishers that at no time did TheCable publish the story being attributed to us. Those who read and follow TheCable are well aware that we do not publish celebrity gossips beyond what they make public via their social media handles. Even the language and style of the report in question are distinctly different from TheCable’s. While we thank those who have been contacting us out of concern, we assure everyone that our lawyers will mount a robust defence against the false accusation, and any forgery, in a court of law.
