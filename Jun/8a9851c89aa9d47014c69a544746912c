Abdullahi Ganduje, governor of Kano, has congratulated Bola Tinubu, former Lagos governor, on clinching the presidential ticket of the All Progressives Congress (APC). Tinubu polled 1,271 votes to defeat 13 other presidential hopefuls at the APC primary, which was concluded on Wednesday. In a statement by Abba Anwar, his chief press secretary, Ganduje said the victory recorded by Tinubu at the primary shows that the latter is highly accepted in the north. The Kano governor also said the development will further strengthen the structure of the party and bring dissenting voices back into the fold. “Asiwaju Bola Ahmed Tinubu’s landslide victory in the just-concluded presidential primary election of the All Progressives Congress (APC) shows his high degree of acceptability in the north, as a bridge builder,” the statement reads. “This patriotic decision will further cement all parts of the country. “President Buhari’s role in making sure that democratic principles are safeguarded in the process is highly commendable and exemplary.”
