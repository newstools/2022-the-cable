The command said forest guards and neighbourhood watch personnel assisted the police in rescuing the victims. Daniel Ndukwe, police spokesman in the state, said the victims were abducted on June 19 while they were praying. “The seven persons included a couple, alleged to have been abducted by unidentified armed men while they went to pray at one ‘Mount Calvary’ located in a forest at Awhum community of the same Udi LGA,” NAN quoted him as saying. “They were abducted on June 19 at about 6.30p.m while praying. “The Command has launched a discreet investigation to fish out the perpetrators.” There has been an increase in reports of abductions across the country in recent times.
