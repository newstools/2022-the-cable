Babagana Kingibe, former secretary to the government of the federation, says Bola Tinubu, former governor of Lagos, is Nigeria’s next president. Tinubu won the presidential ticket of the All Progressives Congress (APC) at the Eagle Square, Abuja, last Wednesday. He got 1,271 votes to defeat 13 other presidential hopefuls. A few days before the APC presidential primary election, Tinubu had sparked controversy when he said (Emi lo kan) — that it was his turn to be president because he had helped President Muhammadu Buhari to win the presidential election in 2015. Since winning the APC presidential ticket, the former Lagos governor has been meeting party stalwarts to seek support ahead of the 2023 elections. Speaking in a meeting with Tinubu at the weekend, Kingibe said the former Lagos governor will be Nigeria’s next president because of his sacrifices.

For all your sacrifices, for all your effort, God will reward you this time.” Kingibe was the running mate of MKO Abiola in the 1993 presidential election, but later worked under the military government of Sani Abacha after the June 12 presidential election was annulled.
