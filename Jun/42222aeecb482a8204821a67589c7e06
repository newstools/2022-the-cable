The police command in Niger has confirmed the abduction of two residents of Doma village in Lapai LGA. Wasiu Abiodun, the command’s public relations officer, said on June 22, the kidnappers abducted two victims working on a farm in Duma village, Lapai. He said the abductors “disappeared into the forest in Rafin-Daji, Abaji area”. “Unfortunately, police tactical team with some vigilante members who were on a rescue operation, engaged the kidnappers while one of the vigilante members lost his life,” he said. He said the police teams are already on the trail to apprehend them. Abiodun appealed to residents, especially rural dwellers, to remain calm as the police and other security agencies would not relent in the fight against banditry in the state. He also urged residents to support security agencies by giving intelligence information that could aid in apprehending criminal elements in the state. He urged them not to hesitate to report any person or group of persons with gunshot injuries to the nearest security outfit for necessary action.
