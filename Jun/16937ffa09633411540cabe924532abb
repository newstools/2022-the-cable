Uyi Akpata, president of the Nigeria Cricket Federation (NCF), has arrived in Kigali in Rwanda to support the national women’s team at the ongoing Kwibuka T20 cricket international tournament. Upon arrival on Thursday, Akpata also watched the Female Yellow-Greens’ last round-robin match which they lost to Rwanda. According to him, the team’s participation was part of NCF’s grand plan for future development. “We lost today and I am sure the technical team has their notes full. The interesting dimension is that we have a couple of players here that will form the core of Nigeria’s under-19 team and this experience will surely be an asset to them,” Akpata said. The Female Yellow-Greens started the event with three back-to-back wins over Brazil, Germany, and Botswana. The team, however, suffered defeats in their last four outings against Uganda, Kenya, Tanzania, and Rwanda. Nigeria won the toss and elected to field against the host country on Thursday, holding the Rwandans to a 91 for the loss of seven wickets at the end of the first inning. But the Nigerians soon struggled to a 68 total with four wickets in hand to lose in the second inning. Nigeria will face Brazil for its last match, seeking placement for the fifth and sixth place team at the tournament. Leke Oyede, Nigeria’s coach, said the team hopes to build on their performance at the tournament. “We are hoping to give a decent ending to this series with a good show in our last match against Brazil,” Oyede said.
