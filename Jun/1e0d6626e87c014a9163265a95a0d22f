Ahmad Yarima, former governor of Zamfara and presidential hopeful seeking the ticket of the All Progressives Congress (APC), has condemned the recent attack on a church in Owo, Ondo state. Several persons were killed, while others sustained injuries, when gunmen attacked the St. Francis Catholic Church in Owo. Reacting to the development in a statement issued on Monday by Olumide Lawal, his media aide, Yarima described the attack as “senseless, unwarranted and unprovoked massacre by agents of darkness”. “Senator Yarima said he was highly disturbed and piqued by the senseless killing of innocent citizens who came purposely to worship God, but met their untimely death in such a tragic circumstance, that sent jitters to the spines of their fellow Nigerians,” the statement reads. “Senator Yarima, therefore, calls on all and sundry to be on their guard all round the clock and poll resources together to ensure effective intelligence gathering to nip in the bud, the barbaric activities of people with dark souls and evil practices, before they could put them into practice. “Senator Yarima, therefore, enjoined all security apparatus to be out in place to ensure that the perpetrators of the heinous crime at Owo are speedily arrested and brought to justice. “The first executive governor of Zamfara state condoles with the Catholic parish, the people of Owo, the families that lost their beloved ones in the dastardly act, and complete recovery for those receiving medical attention in various hospitals, occasioned by various degrees of injury sustained during the massacre. “Senator Yarima prays for peace to reign in the country.”
