Lionel Messi provided two assists as Argentina defeated Italy 3-0 in the highly-anticipated Finalissima clash played at Wembley Stadium on Wednesday night. The Argentine captain was a menace throughout the encounter, assisting goals for Lautaro Martinez and Paolo Dybala. Angel di Maria was also on the score sheet. The Finalissima, previously known as the Artemio Franchi Cup, is a one-off match between winners of the Copa America and European championship — the continental titles in South America and Europe respectively. While Argentina are current Copa America champions, Italy won the rescheduled Euro 2020 last year. Martinez opened the scoring on 28 minutes when he was given the simple task of tapping into an empty net after Messi forced his way into the penalty area. The Inter Milan striker would set up Di Maria to chip Gianluigi Donnarumma, Italy goalkeeper, for the second on the stroke of halftime following another good run from Messi. Argentina continued their total domination in the second half and were only prevented from increasing their tally by Donnarumma’s saves. The former AC Milan shot-stopper was, however, powerless to stop Dybala from making it a 3-0 win, with the departing Juventus player finding the bottom corner with the final kick of the match. The win means Argentina retain the intercontinental title last played in 1993 while the Argentines also preserved their 32-match unbeaten streak against the poor Italians in front of over 87,000 fans.
