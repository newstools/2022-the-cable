Hoodlums on Sunday reportedly attacked a bus carrying journalists in the convoy of Bola Tinubu, APC presidential candidate. The attack was said to have happened while Tinubu’s convoy was leaving the palace of Rilwan Akiolu, Oba of Lagos. Tinubu was said to have visted the Oba of Lagos shortly after arriving in the city from Abuja. The hoodlums were said to have wielded cutlasses and sticks, and threw stones at the convoy. Tinubu was accompanied by Babajide Sanwo-Olu, governor of Lagos, and his Kano counterpart, Umar Ganduje, on the visit to the Oba. Tinubu won the presidential ticket the APC on June 8. His visit to Lagos which has been dubbed “homecoming” by his supporters is said to be his first since clinching the ticket. Below are photos of the damaged press bus. <img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-714294" src="https://f5p3e9e4.stackpathcdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/WhatsApp-Image-2022-06-19-at-7.00.07-PM-300x225-1.jpeg" alt="" width="300" height="225" srcset="https://f5p3e9e4.stackpathcdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/WhatsApp-Image-2022-06-19-at-7.00.07-PM-300x225-1.jpeg 300w, https://f5p3e9e4.stackpathcdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/WhatsApp-Image-2022-06-19-at-7.00.07-PM-300x225-1-24x18.jpeg 24w, https://f5p3e9e4.stackpathcdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/WhatsApp-Image-2022-06-19-at-7.00.07-PM-300x225-1-36x27.jpeg 36w, https://f5p3e9e4.stackpathcdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/WhatsApp-Image-2022-06-19-at-7.00.07-PM-300x225-1-48x36.jpeg 48w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" /> <img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-714295" src="https://f5p3e9e4.stackpathcdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/WhatsApp-Image-2022-06-19-at-7.00.09-PM-750x430-1.jpeg" alt="" width="750" height="430" srcset="https://f5p3e9e4.stackpathcdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/WhatsApp-Image-2022-06-19-at-7.00.09-PM-750x430-1.jpeg 750w, https://f5p3e9e4.stackpathcdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/WhatsApp-Image-2022-06-19-at-7.00.09-PM-750x430-1-300x172.jpeg 300w, https://f5p3e9e4.stackpathcdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/WhatsApp-Image-2022-06-19-at-7.00.09-PM-750x430-1-24x14.jpeg 24w, https://f5p3e9e4.stackpathcdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/WhatsApp-Image-2022-06-19-at-7.00.09-PM-750x430-1-36x21.jpeg 36w, https://f5p3e9e4.stackpathcdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/WhatsApp-Image-2022-06-19-at-7.00.09-PM-750x430-1-48x28.jpeg 48w" sizes="(max-width: 750px) 100vw, 750px" /> <img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-714296" src="https://f5p3e9e4.stackpathcdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/FVpAiE5XoAwH4wz.jpg" alt="" width="650" height="430" srcset="https://f5p3e9e4.stackpathcdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/FVpAiE5XoAwH4wz.jpg 650w, https://f5p3e9e4.stackpathcdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/FVpAiE5XoAwH4wz-300x198.jpg 300w, https://f5p3e9e4.stackpathcdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/FVpAiE5XoAwH4wz-24x16.jpg 24w, https://f5p3e9e4.stackpathcdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/FVpAiE5XoAwH4wz-36x24.jpg 36w, https://f5p3e9e4.stackpathcdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/FVpAiE5XoAwH4wz-48x32.jpg 48w" sizes="(max-width: 650px) 100vw, 650px" />
