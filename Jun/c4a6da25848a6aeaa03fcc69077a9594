Ahmad Lawan, senate president, says Bola Tinubu, former governor of Lagos, deserves the presidential ticket of the All Progressives Congress (APC). In a letter of congratulations to Tinubu, the senate president, who also contested the presidential ticket, expressed satisfaction with the conduct of the primary. He added that the outcome of the primary showed that Tinubu is the popular choice of the APC. “As Your Excellency is aware, I offered myself alongside your good self and other patriotic members of the party to fly its highly coveted flag in the 2023 presidential election,” the letter reads. “I did so in the belief that I have the knowledge base, ideas, experience and desire to provide leadership for our dear country at these most trying times. “However, the outcome of the election process has shown that Your Excellency is the popular choice of our party for that assignment. “I do not have an iota of doubt in the wisdom of that decision by our Party’s delegates from across the country. “Your glittering track record of public service, foresight and grit in party building and administration, as well as the courage you continue to demonstrate in fighting for the entrenchment of democracy in Nigeria make you worthy of the high esteem and trust of our party members everywhere in Nigeria as exhibited at the National Convention. “It is on this note that I heartily congratulate you on your well-deserved victory at the primary. “I have no doubt that with your credentials, experience, antecedents and political sagacity, our great party will go into the 2023 contest confident of victory.” Lawan said he would remain committed to the party at all times and will always be available to work for its success.
