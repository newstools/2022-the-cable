Donald Ojogo, former commissioner for information and orientation in Ondo, says explosives were used in the Owo church attack. On Sunday, St Francis Catholic Church in Owo, Ondo state was attacked by gunmen during service. The gunmen were said to have detonated explosives before firing at the congregants. Many worshippers were killed in the attack, including children and women. Explosives were said to have been used in the attack. Speaking on Sunrise Daily, a Channels Television programme, Ojogo said many of the victims may have died while trying to run away from the point where explosives were used. “There is a clear evidence that explosives were also used but after the explosives, from what we gather from some of the survivors, they said while they were running outside, as a result of the explosives that were used in the church, they were just being shot at,” he said. “So, it was at the cause of the stampede that most of these persons died.” The former commissioner described the late arrival of the police to the scene as unfathomable, adding that a police station is two kilometres away from where the attack happened. He said for adequate protection of citizens, the federal government must submit to demands for state policing. “The nearest police station to that place is two km. There is a police station not far from the Olowo palace, and this happened not far from the palace,” he said. “These gunmen shot for more than 20 minutes and the police didn’t show up. This is the reason we need state police. “If we are truly going to practice true federalism, then each state should have its police to be able to stop such incidents.”
