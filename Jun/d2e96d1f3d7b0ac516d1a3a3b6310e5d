The Real Madrid supporter and honorary member was however made to fight for the second set, needing to win the last five games to take a 2-0 set lead before blistering through the final set in 35 minutes without dropping a game. Speaking after his anticipated victory, Nadal thanked the rapturous crowd while stating his intention to “keep fighting” despite rumours of retirement. “Merci, merci beaucoup. It is completely amazing, the things that are happening this year,” he said. “For me personally, it is very tough to describe the feelings that I have. I never believed I would be here at 36 being competitive… one more final. I don’t know what can happen in the future but I am going to keep fighting to try to keep going, so thank you.” Raphael Nadal, injury-ravaged in recent years, has never lost a French Open final.
