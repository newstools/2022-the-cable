A commander of the civilian joint task force (JTF) has been reportedly killed, following an attack by gunmen on Sabon Gero area of millennium city, Kaduna metropolis. The gunmen were said to have also abducted 16 persons, including a medical doctor and six members of his family, during the attack which occurred on Tuesday. However, six of the abductees were reportedly rescued by members of neighbouring communities who were alerted about the incident. The JTF commander and his team were said to have responded to the attack in the area, but were shot at by bandits. “The bandits opened fire and hit the commander of the JTF on the leg and he fell down, and they shot him on the head,” a resident, who didn’t want to be named, said. “A resident was also hit by a bullet and he died on the way to the hospital. “They kidnapped 16 people but six were rescued. The medical doctor who was abducted with six members of his family seemed to be the target of the terrorists. “The situation could have been worse if neighbouring communities, who were alerted about the attack, had not mobilised to chase the terrorists. The neighbouring communities were able to rescue six of the abducted people.” Mohammad Jalige, spokesman of the Kaduna police command, did not respond to calls when contacted for reaction on the incident.
