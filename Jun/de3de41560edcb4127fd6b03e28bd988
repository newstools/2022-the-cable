Over the past few days, multiple social media posts, especially on Facebook, had claimed that Peter Nwachukwu, husband of late Osinachi, popular gospel singer, has been sentenced to death by hanging. Osinachi, renowned for her hit song ‘Ekwueme’ was alleged to have been a silent victim of domestic assault from Peter. The gospel singer, who passed away on April 8, was initially thought to have died of throat cancer. But associates claimed it may be connected to an assault by her husband who was later arrested. Her death had stirred outrage, with many Nigerians calling on relevant authorities to ensure justice is served. The federal government had recently filed charges of culpable homicide against Peter before a high court in Abuja. The charges were filed under sections 104 and 379 of the Administration of Criminal Justice Act 2015 and Section 221 of the Penal Code, and the Violence Against Persons Prohibition Act (VAPP). However, some social media users had circulated a post claiming the court has sentenced Osinachi’s husband to death. The post was widely shared on Facebook and Twitter. <img class="alignnone size-large wp-image-706875" src="https://f5p3e9e4.stackpathcdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/Screenshot_20220601-214606-696x1024.png" alt="" width="696" height="1024" srcset="https://f5p3e9e4.stackpathcdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/Screenshot_20220601-214606-696x1024.png 696w, https://f5p3e9e4.stackpathcdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/Screenshot_20220601-214606-204x300.png 204w, https://f5p3e9e4.stackpathcdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/Screenshot_20220601-214606-16x24.png 16w, https://f5p3e9e4.stackpathcdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/Screenshot_20220601-214606-24x36.png 24w, https://f5p3e9e4.stackpathcdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/Screenshot_20220601-214606-33x48.png 33w, https://f5p3e9e4.stackpathcdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/Screenshot_20220601-214606.png 720w" sizes="(max-width: 696px) 100vw, 696px" /> Gossip Mill Biafra, a Facebook page with over 58,000 followers, published the viral post.

In the Nigerian justice system, the court trial of an alleged offender usually takes different stages. The stages include but are not limited to: arraignment, acceptance of plea, hearing, presentation of evidence, adoption of final written addresses, conviction and sentencing. TheCable reviewed credible media reports published regarding Peter’s case and findings showed that the federal government has only filed a 23-count charge against him, and he has not been arraigned in court. VERDICT The viral post of Osinachi’s husband being sentenced to death by hanging is false.
