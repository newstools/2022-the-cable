Afenifere, a Yoruba socio-political group, says the attack on St Francis Catholic Church in Owo, Ondo state, shows the failure of the federal government in securing lives and property. Gunmen had attacked the Catholic church while the Sunday mass was nearing its conclusion. Many people were killed in the attack, including children and women. The gunmen were said to have detonated explosives before firing at the worshippers. In a statement signed by its secretary-general, Sola Ebiseni, Afenifere said the incident is an “irrefutable sign of the failure” of the government. “In all of these, the Federal Government of Nigeria, which against federal precepts, continues to monopolise security and its architecture, has proven most helpless and irresponsible in securing life and property, an irrefutable sign of the failure of the Nigerian State,” the statement reads in part. Afenifere said the Nigerian government should be held accountable for the carnage. “The World be told to hold the Federal Government of Nigeria responsible for the ensuing consequences of this deliberate assault on the will of the Yoruba people for peace in our land in our unstoppable strives for development matching with the rest of the civilised world. We say in clear terms that the noiseless glides of the Amotekun is no sign of fear and that this stamp on the tail of the viper is one too many,” the group said. The socio-political group also commiserated with the families of the victims who lost their lives in the incident.
