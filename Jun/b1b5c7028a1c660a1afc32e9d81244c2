The Yoruba Leadership and Peace Initiative (TYLPI) says the attack on St. Francis Catholic Church in Owo, Ondo state, is a “grievous and barbaric” violation of Yorubaland, which will not go unchallenged. Gunmen attacked the Catholic church on Sunday, and killed several worshippers, including children. The gunmen were said to have detonated explosives before firing at the worshippers. In a statement signed by its director of publicity, Tunde Ipinmisho, TYLPI said the incident underscores the growing inability of the government to secure the country. “Government must take decisive steps to restore law and order in the country, especially now that preparations are on for a general election and a national headcount,” the group said. “The security situation must become the government’s topmost concern, as the very nature of some of the recent incidents throws a big challenge to the nation’s unity and continued existence. “Beyond the usual routine approach to investigation and the apprehension of crime suspects, the security agencies must put all their resources into tracking and apprehending those behind the dastardly attack of the Owo church. “The security challenges facing the country are the very reasons the government needs to listen to and address the calls for the restructuring of the country to give more powers to the sub nationalities.” The group also sympathised with Rotimi Akeredolu, governor of Ondo, and residents over the incident, and prayed that normalcy would soon return to Owo.
