A domestic violence and sexual offences court in Ikeja, on Wednesday, sentenced one Ayodele Bailey to life imprisonment for defiling a 15-year-old girl. Abiola Soladoye, the judge, said the case of defilement against the convict was proved by the prosecution. “The convict is rough and selfish. The survivor gave her testimony truthfully, cogently, positively and brilliantly. She was brave,” NAN quoted the judge as saying. “The story of the defendant was full of lies. He is a reckless and ruthless defendant. “He is hereby found guilty as charged. He is sentenced to life imprisonment without an option of fine.’’ The judge also ordered that the name of the convict should be written in the register of sexual offenders in the state. According to NAN, the prosecution presented two witnesses against the defendant during the trial. Olusola Soneye and Olufunke Adegoke, members of the state’s prosecution team, said the convict committed the offence on December 18, 2017, in Alaka, Mushin, Lagos. The prosecution said the survivor had visited her grandmother and was playing with other children outside the house when the convict lured her into an uncompleted building and defiled her. The prosecution said the offence contravened the provisions of section 137 of the Criminal Law of Lagos State, 2015.
