Sunday Dare, minister of youth and sports development, has inaugurated the interim management committee (IMC) to “revamp basketball from the grassroots”. The minister inaugurated the 10-man IMC in Abuja on Saturday. Last month, Dare announced that President Muhammadu Buhari had agreed to withdraw Nigeria from competing in international basketball competitions for the next two years. He said the ban is part of efforts by the government to rejig the sport’s architecture in the country. The minister said a committee would be put in place to oversee the advancement of the game in Nigeria. Speaking at the inauguration, Dare tasked the committee members to attract sponsors and ensure the development of the Nigerian basketball leagues. “The terms of reference of the committee are to draw up programmes that will revamp basketball from the grassroots,” he said. “Attract corporate sponsors and revive the moribund domestic leagues for the development of the game within two years. “Ensure the development of basketball facilities in the entire country, and any other thing that will facilitate the development of basketball in Nigeria. “I, therefore, charge you all to carry out this enormous task with the utmost sense of responsibility, bearing in mind you cannot afford to fail in this national assignment.” The minister also advised the team “not to get entangled with federation politics”. The committee is chaired by Henry Nzekwu, while other members include Udon Ubon Humapwa,  Frank Jituboh and Adamu Ahmed. Others are Peter Nelson, Rahinatu Garba, Aderemi Adewunmi, Oluchi Nzekwe, Seni Adio, and Zenith Bank representative. Nigeria’s withdrawal from international basketball competitions has been confirmed by FIBA, and the body has invited Mali as a replacement for D’Tigress at the upcoming 2022 Women’s World Cup in Australia.
