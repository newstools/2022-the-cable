Ujiri is currently involved in building 100 standard basketball courts across Africa through the Giant of Africa Foundation which he co-founded. The first set of the courts have been fully developed and handed over to communities and schools across the continent in the last quarter of 2021. The foundation has donated courts in Nigeria, Burkina Faso, Kenya, Cote d’Ivoire, Rwanda and Senegal between September 2021 and May this year. Ujiri was also among top figures who earlier this month urged the federal government to reverse its decision to withdraw the country from international basketball. The Nigerian was the first African to lead a North American major-league sports team after being named the Raptors’ president and general manager in 2013.
