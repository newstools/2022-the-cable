Tinubu, in a congratulatory message by Tunde Rahman, his media spokesperson, said Sanwo-Olu had exceeded expectations from his tenure. He said Sanwo-Olu’s achievements were numerous to mention, noting that this had garnered him the love and adoration of the people of Lagos, young and old, male and female. The former governor of Lagos described Sanwo-Olu as “a man of high intellect, deep political acumen, and exceptional character”. “Governor Sanwo-Olu’s exceptional leadership and steadfast dedication to the task of bettering the lives of Lagos residents are showcased daily in the smoothness with which the administration of the state now runs,” Tinubu said. “He is, indeed, a prime exemplar of the excellence upon which our beloved state prides itself. “The governor has demonstrated uncommon compassion and humility as well as a strong will and steely determination. “He has risen to every challenge placed before him.
