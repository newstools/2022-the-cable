Adamu Abdullahi, national chairman of the All Progressives Congress (APC), says he is committed to the presidential campaign of Bola Tinubu. The APC chairman and the party’s national working committee (NWC) members met with Tinubu in Abuja on Thursday. At the meeting, Adamu said the ruling party “will deliver” the former Lagos governor as president in 2023. He said: “Actions speak louder than words. We are here to join our brother, to congratulate him, and to assure him… this is our project. By the grace of God, we will deliver him as president of Nigeria in 2023.” The APC chairman said he and the NWC members have become the “foot soldiers” of Tinubu. “You have come a long way; you have seen it all. I can tell you that we have a commitment beyond description, a commitment to deliver you as president,” he said. “Our party has spoken loud and clear, and delivering the will of the people, our delegates have given you the mandate to lead. “We are all now your soldiers. We will follow you to the nooks and crannies of this country. We will not rest on your oars until we have delivered you as president.” Similarly, northern APC governors also visited the presidential candidate of the ruling party in his residence. Days leading to the APC presidential primary, the northern governors had declared their support for a power shift to the southern region. They also countered the decision of Adamu to declare Senate President Ahmad Lawan as the consensus candidate. At the primary, Tinubu polled 1,271 votes to defeat 13 other presidential hopefuls. Rotimi Amaechi, former minister of transportation, polled 316 votes, Vice-President Yemi Osinbajo got 235 votes, while Lawan secured 152 votes. Rochas Okorocha, Tein Jack-Rich and Tunde Bakare got zero votes; Chukwuemeka Nwajiuba got one vote; David Umahi polled 38 votes; Ogbonnaya Onu got one vote; Yahaya Bello polled 47 votes, and Ben Ayade got 37 votes.
