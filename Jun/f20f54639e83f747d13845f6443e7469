Rotimi Amaechi, presidential hopeful, has condemned the attack on a church by gunmen in Owo, Ondo state. On Sunday, St Francis Catholic Church in Owo was attacked by gunmen while mass was in progress. Many — including women and children — were killed in the attack. In a statement, the former transportation minister described the incident as “a senseless murder of innocent citizens”. “I feel so sad and livid that these criminals are so emboldened to carry out these barbaric attacks on the people in broad daylight. Our security agencies have to put heads together and smoke out these monsters and ensure they are punished, immobilized and totally flushed out,” the former Rivers governor said. “They must also in partnership with our government, step up intelligence and work round the clock to nip such acts of terror in the bud. “May the souls of the departed rest in the bosom of the Lord. I also pray for the families, the church, the people and the Government of Ondo State to find strength in the midst of the sorrow and pain.”
