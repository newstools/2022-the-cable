Rauf Olaniyan, the deputy governor of Oyo state, has defected to the All Progressives Congress (APC). His defection ends weeks of speculation about the deputy governor’s membership in the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP). During an interaction with journalists on Sunday, Olaniyan said his decision to cross-carpet was informed by calls from his supporters who were unhappy with his exclusion from the affairs of the PDP and the state. The deputy governor said his decision would not affect his relationship with Seyi Makinde, the Oyo governor. There has been a rift between the governor and his deputy for more than a year, with leaders in the deputy’s camp accusing Makinde of breaching an agreement made before the last election that brought them in. They also alleged that Makinde did not involve Olaniyan in the affairs of the state. Olaniyan was a governorship aspirant in the African Democratic Congress before the party entered into an alliance with the PDP ahead of the 2019 election. By virtue of the alliance, it was agreed that Olaniyan would drop his governorship ambition and become the running mate to Makinde. In recent weeks, there had been reports that the deputy governor would leave the PDP but he recently debunked the rumours, stating that he would remain in the party. A few days ago, Makinde replaced Olaniyan with Bayo Lawal as his deputy for the 2023 governorship election in the state.
