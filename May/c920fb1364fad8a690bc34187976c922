President Muhammadu Buhari, on Thursday, held a meeting with Vice-President Yemi Osinbajo shortly before the former departed for the African Union (AU) meeting in Malabo, Equatorial Guinea. From May 25 to 28, the AU is hosting two summits in Malabo — the ‘Extraordinary Humanitarian Summit and Pledging Conference’, as well as the ‘Extraordinary Summit on Unconstitutional Changes of Government in Africa’. The meeting between Buhari and Osinbajo, which held at the president’s office, comes amid preparations for the All Progressives Congress (APC) presidential primary scheduled to hold from May 29 to 30, While there isn’t yet official information on what was discussed during the meeting, TheCable understands that part of the discussions focused on the forthcoming presidential primary. According to sources, Buhari is expected back in the country on the eve of the APC presidential primary. Although it isn’t yet clear if Osinbajo — an APC presidential hopeful — spoke with the president on his recent consultations with party delegates and stakeholders across the country, a source said there was a possibility that the matter also formed part of the discussions. Meanwhile, Buhari is yet to reveal who he would prefer as his successor, but according to sources, “it’s very unlikely that the VP would have gotten in the race without the backing of his principal.”
