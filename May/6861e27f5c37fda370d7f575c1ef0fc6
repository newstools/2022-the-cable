Godswill Akpabio, outgoing minister of Niger Delta affairs, says it is time to “propagate Buharism”. Akpabio spoke on Friday at a valedictory session for outgoing members of the federal executive council (FEC). The ministers are leaving the cabinet of President Muhammadu Buhari to pursue their political ambitions. On Wednesday, Buhari directed all members of his cabinet seeking elective office in the 2023 elections to resign on or before May 16. Speaking on behalf of the outgoing ministers, Akpabio thanked the president for giving them the opportunity to serve and contribute their quota to nation-building. He described working with Buhari as a “fantastic and knowledgeable experience”, adding that as they step aside, he and his colleagues will continue to be disciples of the president. “As we step aside from FEC, I want you to know that you have disciples in us. I want you to know that it is time for us to propagate Buharism,” Akpabio said. “I want you to know that we are going to be working closely with the minister of information and culture to take your message of transformation, love, patience, and administrative sagacity to Nigerians.” Akpabio described leaving the president’s cabinet as a thing of “sadness and joy”. “Sadness in the sense that we are going to miss the continuous daily and weekly interaction with a father and learning from him,” he said. “Joy, because we now have an opportunity to go to the wider audience in Nigeria to speak more of your achievements for this country. ” While lauding the president’s patriotism, Akpabio said “Buhari is the best president Nigeria could ever have at a time of difficult circumstance”. “May one of us succeed you in order to continue the good legacies you have laid on ground,” he added. “We have seen and know your vision. We know where you want the country to be.”
