Liverpool and Tottenham played out a 1-1 draw in their English Premier League (EPL) encounter at Anfield stadium on Saturday night. Luiz Diaz cancelled Heung-Min Son’s opener for Tottenham as Liverpool crucially slipped up in the title race. The keenly contested encounter produced several chances but without a goal for either side in the first half. Antonio Conte’s men took the lead 11 minutes into the second half when Son finished off a sweeping counterattack to punish Liverpool’s uncharacteristically disorganized defence. The quadruple-chasing side, however, recovered from going behind and equalized on 74 minutes, with Diaz’s shot taking a deflection before finding the back of the net. The visitors then held on to deny Liverpool the winner, hurting their hosts’ title chance. Liverpool remain unbeaten in 16 EPL matches. With the draw, they now top the EPL with 83 points and on goal difference, ahead of Manchester City who play on Sunday. In other matches, Brighton thrashed Manchester United 4-0 to record their highest ever EPL win in their history. Three of the goals came in the second half as Man United appeared to have conceded the highest number of goals in their Premier League history. Watford’s relegation from the EPL was also confirmed following a 1-0 loss at Crystal Palace. RESULTS
