The Nigerian Army, Nigeria Police Force (NPF), Nigeria Security and Civil Defence Corps (NSCDC), and Civilian Joint Task Force (CJTF) say they will embark on a show of force within the Maiduguri metropolis, Borno state. TheCable understands that the decision was reached at a meeting held at the Borno police command. The meeting was attended by the Garrison Commander 7 Decision, other heads of other security agencies, leaders of the Christian Association of Nigeria (CAN), and Chief Imams, among others. According to Zagazola Makama, a counterinsurgency expert in Lake Chad, the show of force is a result of rumours of a planned protest over an alleged blasphemous statement made against the Prophet Muhammed (S.A.W) by a lady on her Facebook page. The lady, Neomi Goni, while arguing on Facebook with a fellow user of the platform, reportedly made a blasphemous statement that went viral, with residents and youths calling for her arrest and prosecution. Neomi was said to have immediately deleted her Facebook account. Zagazola said, “according to competent security sources who were present during the meeting, it was discovered that Noemi was not in Borno when she made the statement but only attended one of the institutions in the state and had since left the state”. The expert said security agencies had also moved to seal the former compound occupied by Neomi to avoid a breach of security.
