The Man, the Soldier, the Patriot, biography of Lt. Gen Ibrahim Attahiru has five chapters which trace the provenance of the late chief of army staff, his family life, and his exploits as a soldier. It reveals details of the principles that guided his life with copious testimonies from people who had personal and professional relationships with him. The book also has a dedicated tribute section where schoolmates, friends, acquittances and former teachers spoke about the late military officer. Ibrahim died on active service in a plane crash at the Kaduna International Airport alongside 10 other top military officers and men on May 21, 2021. He was appointed by President Muhammadu barely four months earlier. He had immediately assured Nigerians of the Nigerian Army’s capacity to restore end insecurity and restore citizens’ confidence in the country. Many Nigerians regarded his short reign as significantly eventful, a reason for which many people look forward to his posthumous biography.
