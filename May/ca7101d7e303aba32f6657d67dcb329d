Tanko-Yakasai was sacked by Ganduje in February 2021, for making “continued unguarded comments” and criticising President Muhammadu Buhari. He had also accused the APC government of failing to protect the lives and property of Nigerians in the wake of kidnappings and gunmen attacks across the country. While leaving the APC in March, Tanko-Yakasai said the party had failed to fulfil its campaign promises to Nigerians.
