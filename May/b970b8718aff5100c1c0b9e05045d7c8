Datti Baba-Ahmed, a chieftain of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) who had expressed his interest in contesting the Kaduna governorship seat, has withdrawn from the race. Baba-Ahmed had, in January 2022, announced his intention to contest the governorship election when he submitted his letter of interest to the PDP leadership in Kaduna. However, hours before the party’s governorship primary is scheduled to hold, the PDP chieftain says he is no longer interested in contesting. While the primaries for candidates for house of representatives and senate have been conducted, the PDP governorship primaries are slated for Wednesday across the country. In a letter addressed to Hassan Hyet, chairman of the PDP in Kaduna, Baba-Ahmed said the current process in relation to the primaries do not align with his vision as a politician. “Credible first-hand reports have apparently proved that anticipated changes in our politics are yet hold and lessons yet unlearnt as evidenced in the ongoing primaries, needless to give specifics,” the letter reads. “These are inconsistent with my purpose of being in politics. “I consequently hereby respectfully withdraw from the 2023 governorship contest of Kaduna State under our great party, the PDP. I, however, remain loyal and supportive. “I pray for the day we get our politics right for the sake of Nigeria.” With Baba-Ahmed’s withdrawal from the race, six aspirants will slug it out at the primary scheduled to take place at the Ahmadu Bello stadium in Kaduna. The remaining aspirants include Isa Ashiru, the party’s flag-bearer in 2019; Sani Sidi, a former director-general of the National Emergency Management Agency (NEMA); Shehu Sani, a former senator; Mukhtar Yero, a former governor; Sani Abbas, a lawyer; and Haruna Saeed, a former accountant-general of the state.
