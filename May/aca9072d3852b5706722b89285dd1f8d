Gunmen have reportedly set ablaze the LGA secretariat of Idemili north in Anambra state. The armed men also razed a magistrate court in the area. Tochukwu Ikenga, Anambra police spokesman, told TheCable the gunmen attacked the structures in the early hours of Monday. TheCable understands that cars and buildings on the premises, including several files, were burnt in the attack. “It took the quick intervention of the police responding team to contain the damage the hoodlums planned in the secretariat,” Ikenga said. “Unfortunately, some of the offices and office vehicles inside the LGA were affected by the fire. Meanwhile, no life was lost and normalcy has been restored in the area.” The development is the latest in a string of attacks on the state’s government infrastructure. In recent times, residents in the south-east, especially in Anambra and Imo have been targeted by gunmen, but a recent trend has seen the assailants target government structures. In March, the secretariat of Nnewi south LGA in Ukpor, Anambra state, was burnt down by gunmen. A week later, the attackers set ablaze Aguata,  LGA headquarters where Charles Soludo, governor of Anambra, hails from.
