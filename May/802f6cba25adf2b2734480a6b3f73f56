The Lagos police command say its operatives have arrested one John Greg, a Lebanese, who allegedly hit a resident identified as Omotomi Akinsanya, while driving against traffic. On Wednesday, a Twitter user, @wellzpapi, in a series of tweets, narrated how Greg allegedly used his car to hit Omotomi at the Victoria Island axis of Lagos. The Twitter user claimed that the incident happened when the Lebanese was driving against traffic, also known as one-way, at a top speed, adding that the victim is in a critical condition at the Lagos University Teaching Hospital. The incident sparked outrage on social media, followed by calls on the authorities to ensure justice for the victim. In Lagos, driving against traffic, popularly known as one-way driving, is an offence liable to a three-year jail term and forfeiture of the vehicle. Giving an update on the incident, Benjamin Hundeyin, Lagos police spokesperson, in a series of tweets on Thursday, said the Lebanese drove away after the incident but he was chased down. Hundeyin also said the embassy of Lebanon has been informed about the incident, adding that the vehicle used by Greg has been impounded. “On May 4, 2022 at about 0745hrs, a middle-aged Lebanese by name John Greg ‘m’ drove a Toyota 4Runner recklessly and against traffic on Sanusi Fafunwa Road, thereby hitting one Omotomi Akinsanya ‘f’ which resulted in serious injuries to her leg,” Hundeyin wrote. “He sped off but was chased and arrested. Suspect in our custody. Vehicle impounded and in our station. Victim undergoing treatment at LASUTH. Victim’s family duly informed. Embassy of Lebanon duly informed. Investigation ongoing.”
