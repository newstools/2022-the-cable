Dana Air says it is experiencing a scarcity of aviation fuel across airports in Nigeria, which has led to recent flight delays. The airline said this in a statement on Wednesday, signed by Sukhjinder Mann, CEO of Dana Air. In the statement, titled ‘Looming fuel scarcity’, the airline restated its commitment to maintaining reliable flight schedules and promised competitive airfares for passengers. “Unfortunately, we are again witnessing the scarcity of Jet A1 fuel across the airports in Nigeria, which has, in some cases, caused recent flight delays,” Dana Air said. “Our commitment towards offering a convenient and reliable schedule has never been in doubt and has always been centred on setting new standards in customer experience and redefining air travel. This communication is to reassure you that we have the commitment of our fuel partners to service our requirements and that we will continue to offer you competitive fares for your business and leisure travels.” It also said it was committed to maintaining safety standards and operational efficiency. Dana Air’s recent outcry over the scarcity of aviation fuel comes two days after it pulled out of the planned industrial action by Airlines Operators of Nigeria (AON). Most airlines in Nigeria are also known for flight delays and cancellations. On Friday, the AON announced its decision to suspend flight operations from Monday, May 9, 2022, owing to the high cost of aviation fuel. They said the Jet A1 fuel had increased to N700 a litre from N500; a situation the airline operators said would dangerously eat into their profit margins and could drive them out of business. Following government’s intervention AON, however, suspended the planned strike on May 8, 2022.
