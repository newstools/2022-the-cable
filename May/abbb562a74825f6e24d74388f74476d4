Tochukwu Ikenga, Anambra police spokesman, says the command has not arrested any suspect linked to the death of Okechukwu Okoye, lawmaker representing Aguata II constituency. Okoye, an indigene of Isuofia, the same community as Chukwuma Soludo, governor of Anambra, was kidnapped in Aguata on May 15 alongside Cyril Chiegboka, his campaign director. Subsequently, the lawmaker’s headless body was found in Nnobi area of the state. Shortly after this, Soludo had offered N10 million reward to anyone with useful information on the killers of Okoye. Over the weekend, there were reports that the police had arrested the suspected killer of the lawmaker in Imo state. Speaking on the development, Ikenga said the police command in Anambra does not have any suspect linked to the incident in custody. “The command wants to use this opportunity to let the members of the public know that the trust bestowed on the police will not be taken for granted, especially as it regards unmasking the identities of the persons involved in the murder of the lawmaker in the state,” he said. “We have no suspect in custody yet, but investigation is still ongoing and soon we will get back to the members of the public on the development.” When TheCable reached out to Michael Abattam, the Imo police spokesperson, he said no such arrest was recorded by the state command. “We didn’t arrest any suspect linked to killing of the lawmaker,” he said.
