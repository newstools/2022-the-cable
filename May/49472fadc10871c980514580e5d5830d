The 2022 survey was conducted between March and April 2022 and yielded over 80,000 brand mentions and over 3,500 unique brands. “This year, brands like Dangote, MTN, GTbank, Coca-Cola, Glo, Jumia, and Nasco were among the Top 100 brands in Africa,” the statement reads in part. “Also, the Nigerian doyenne of marketing, founder and chairman of Troyka Group, Dr. Biodun Shobanjo and GT Bank’s Group CEO, Segun Agbaje, were awarded the inaugural Africa Brand Leadership Excellence awards for inspiring brand-led excellence that drives the growth of made in Africa brands.” Delivering the keynote speech at the event, Biodun Shobanjo, founder and chairman, Troyka Group, said the Brand Africa survey is an awakening for advertising and marketing communications professionals to create campaigns that stir the hearts of the consumers. “When we creatively get consumers to feel something about a brand then we would have successfully created advertising that resonates,” Shobanjo said. On her part, Tosin Adefeko, chief executive officer and founder, AT3 Resources, said: “Today presents an opportunity to celebrate African brands, African leaders, and African corporates who continue to contribute their quota to the economy via a brand led agenda. “I am excited that African brands are now taking charge towards fulfilling the African Union agenda for a peaceful and prosperous Africa. “The Brand Africa event is in its 12th year but the first in Lagos so it is an honour and privilege for us at AT3 Resources to curate, co-ordinate and provide strategic counsel to the Brand Africa team; strategic communications and media interventions form the core of our offerings to stakeholders in the Nigerian market and platforms such as this give us opportunities for expression.”
