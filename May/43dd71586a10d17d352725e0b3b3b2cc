Arsenal scored a second-half winner to defeat West Ham United 2-1 in the English Premier League (EPL) encounter on Sunday. The Gunners needed two headed goals from Rob Holding and Gabriel Martinelli, the central defenders, to overcome the home side, thus maintaining their grip on the final UEFA Champions League qualification spot. Holding rose highest to nod in Bukayo Saka’s corner kick on 39 minutes after which Martinelli did the same on 55 minutes for what proved to be the match-winner. Jarrod Bowen had earlier equalised on the stroke of halftime with a deflected low shot. The win takes Mikel Arteta’s men to 63 points and fourth position, two ahead of Tottenham who remain fifth despite defeating Leicester City 3-1 earlier in in the day. Heung-Min Son (brace) and Harry Kane scored for the Lillywhites while Kelechi Iheanacho, Super Eagles forward, scored Leicester’s consolation. The race for the EPL title also continued over the weekend with Manchester City, the league leaders, and challengers Liverpool both securing wins away from home. While Liverpool scored an early goal to overcome Newcastle 1-0, Man City trounced Leeds 4-0 to push the Whites towards more relegation trouble. At the other end of the table, Norwich became the first team to suffer relegation from the EPL this season after losing 2-0 at Aston Villa, while Watford are on the brink, no thanks to another demoralising 2-1 loss at home to Burnley. Everton, another relegation-threatened side, held on to a lifeline thanks to a surprise 1-0 win over third-placed Chelsea at Goodison Park.
