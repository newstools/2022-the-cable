Vice-President Yemi Osinbajo says the killing of Harirat Jubril and her children in Anambra state is a demeaning and callous act. Gunmen killed Harirat and her children in a community in Orumba north LGA of the state over the weekend. The killings have since sparked outrage. In a statement on Wednesday, Laolu Akande, Osinbajo’s spokesman, quoted the vice-president as saying there is no excuse for the killings. According to Akande, the presidential hopeful spoke with journalists shortly after meeting with delegates of the All Progressives Congress (APC) in Makurdi, Benue state. “What took place in Anambra with the killing of a woman and her children demeans us all. It is such a callous act and so brutal,” Osinbajo was quoted as saying. “I think that we must be very careful, as a people, with this type of killings that are going on, especially where it is obviously to create such horror, annoyance and create a situation where we begin to have ethnic conflicts again and all that. “And I think we must all be careful and condemn it in the strongest possible terms; there is no excuse for it whatsoever. We must not allow a situation where we get to the point where we even countenance individuals who can do this sort of thing. “How does anyone kill a woman and her children? I think it is such a terrible tragedy condemnable by all. Mr President has spoken about it and I just want to join my voice with those of others who are completely outraged by it.”
