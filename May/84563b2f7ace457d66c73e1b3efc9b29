President Muhammadu Buhari is currently meeting with outgoing ministers at the presidential villa in Abuja. On Wednesday, the president directed all members of his cabinet seeking elective office in the 2023 elections to resign on or before May 16. The directive is in line with the provisions of section 84(12) of the electoral act which states that: “No political appointee at any level shall be a voting delegate or be voted for at the convention or congress of any political party for the purpose of the nomination of candidates for any election.” The president had asked the national assembly to delete the section but the legislature refused to. Ministers at meeting are Chris Ngige, minister of labour and employment; Rotimi Amaechi, transportation minister; Paulen Tallen, minister of women affairs, and Godswill Akpabio, minister of Niger Delta affairs.
