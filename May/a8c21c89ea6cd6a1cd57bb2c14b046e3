Bola Tinubu, a chieftain of the All Progressives Congress (APC) and presidential hopeful, says his chances of winning the ticket of the party are high. According to NAN, Tinubu said this on Sunday during his visit to Taraba to meet with APC delegates in the state. “My chances of winning the ticket are incredibly high and I am very confident. I am sure I can and I will win it,” he  said. Speaking on the possibility of a consensus arrangement, Tinubu said he would prefer a democratic process on the selection of the choice of who would become the APC flagbearer in the 2023 presidential election. “I want democracy; I am voting for democracy — one man, one vote,” he said. Tinubu, who announced his intention to contest the presidency in January 2022, recently received the APC presidential nomination and expression of interest forms from the Tinubu Support Group (TSG). The support group, led by James Faleke, a member of the house of representatives, picked up the form for Tinubu in Abuja on Friday. The former Lagos governor is up against Vice-President Yemi Osinbajo, David Umahi, governor of Ebonyi; Chris Ngige, minister of labour; Yahaya Bello, governor of Kogi; Rotimi Amaechi, minister of transportation, among others, for the APC ticket.
