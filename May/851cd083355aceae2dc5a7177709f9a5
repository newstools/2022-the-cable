President Muhammadu Buhari has condemned the beheading of two soldiers in Imo state. An army couple — Gloria Matthew and Audu Linus — were attacked on Saturday by gunmen in Imo. They were said to be on their way to fulfil their traditional wedding rites when they were shot and beheaded. Condemning the development in a statement issued on Wednesday by Garba Shehu, presidential spokesman, Buhari described the killing of the soldiers as “barbaric”. “On behalf of the government and the entire nation, President Muhammadu Buhari expresses deep condolences to the Nigerian Army and the families of Master Warrant Officer Audu Linus and his partner, Private Gloria Mathew, who were beheaded after being shot by the terrorist group, the Indigenous People of Biafra, IPOB, on Saturday as confirmed by the Nigerian Army,” the statement reads. “The corpses were inhumanely treated and gleefully posted on social media platforms. “The President joins fellow citizens in expressing deep sense of shock and condemns the barbarism of the perpetrators of this unfortunate incident, and similar acts of violence against law enforcement agents, describing it as alien to all cultures and civilisations.” Buhari also urged community leaders to “speak with one voice, to show that the entire country is one against this cruel and barbaric act of violence”. Describing the incident as “unacceptable”, he added that security agencies have been directed to “do their utmost in apprehending the perpetrators of these barbaric acts and bring them to justice”.
