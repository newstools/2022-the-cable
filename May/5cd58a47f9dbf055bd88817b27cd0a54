A woman and her four children have been killed by gunmen in Anambra state. The incident was said to have taken place in a community in Orumba north LGA of the state over the weekend. Confirming the development on Tuesday, Tochukwu Ikenga, Anambra police spokesperson, said investigation into the incident has commenced. “Investigation has since commenced and our deployment is very strategic and intelligent-driven aimed at unraveling the identities of these perpetrators,” he said in a message sent to TheCable. The killing of the woman, who is said to be a resident of Hausa extraction, has elicited criticism in the light of recent attacks across the state by gunmen. Echeng Echeng, Anambra police commissioner, on Tuesday, paid a visit to the Hausa community in the LGA. In his remarks during the visit, Echeng said the police will ensure adequate security for the community. Also reacting to the development in a statement issued on Tuesday, Christian Aburime, spokesman to Chukwuma Soludo, governor of Anambra, condemned the killing, but said it had no religious or ethnic undertones. “While it is true that there is general insecurity across the country, there is no targeted religious or ethnic killings in Anambra State. As a matter of fact, Anambra indigenes have suffered more casualties as a result of the unfortunate killings,” the statement reads. He also said the state is stepping up efforts to tackle insecurity. “It is on record that Ndi Anambra and people of the North and other parts of the country who live and do business in the state, not only share common values, but have always lived at peace with each other in the state,” he said. “Governor Soludo’s administration has not only demonstrated commitment in tackling insecurity but has continuously reassured both indigenes and non-indigenes in the State of their protection and safety.”
