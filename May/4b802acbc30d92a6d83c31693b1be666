Aminu Tambuwal, Sokoto governor, has withdrawn from contesting the presidency on the platform of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP). Tambuwal, one of the presidential hopefuls in the race, announced his withdrawal at the national convention of the party on Saturday. He asked his supporters to support the aspiration of former Vice-President Atiku Abubakar. Earlier, the Sokoto governor had said he possesses all the qualities needed to be president of Nigeria, describing himself as a bridge between the young and the old. “We are compelled to rescue this country and rebuild it together,” he told the delegates. Tambuwal’s withdrawal from the race came shortly after Nwachukwu Anakuenze, another presidential hopeful, announced his decision to withdraw from the race. “Finally, I’m sorry to let you know that I’m withdrawing from the race today, because why we came was because the power was supposed to be zoned to the south and south-east,” he said. “That changed and the constitution of PDP hasn’t changed. And I got the delegates’ list only two days ago, with no phone numbers. We don’t have anybody to reach. “I want my delegates to support the best candidate that will unite Nigeria and do something for everybody.”
