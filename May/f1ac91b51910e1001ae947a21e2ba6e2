The United Nations information centre (UNIC), in collaboration with the Media Awareness and Information for All Networks (MAIN), has organised a training for journalists on reporting about sustainable development goals (SDGs). The two-day event, which held between May 10 and May 11 in Lagos, featured paper presentations, group sessions, as well as discussions on “sustainability journalism”. In his remarks, Ronald Kayanja, UNIC director, spoke on the need for countries, communities and individuals to understand the importance of promoting sustainable development. Oluseyi Soremekun, UNIC national information officer, explained the social, economic and environmental dimensions of the 17 SDGs, adding that when journalists write, the eventual outcome should focus on the implementation of SDGs. Lai Oso, chairman of MAIN, in his presentation, highlighted the importance of projecting SDGs within media reports, in line with efforts to promote sustainable development. In his presentation, Jide Jimoh, associate professor of the school of communications, Lagos State University (LASU), spoke on the impact of climate change on SDGs, adding that journalists should always endeavour to ensure that the language of reporting is accessible to as many persons as possible, irrespective of educational background. There were also presentations by Ganiyat Adenle, a lecturer at the Lagos State University, on the impact of gender equality on SDGs; Simisola Oso of the department of microbiology, LASU, spoke on managing waste in Lagos; and Solape Hammond of the Lagos office of the SDGs and investments, who was represented by Abosede George, highlighted the Lagos government’s efforts on SDG implementation. At the end of the training, 59 journalists from online, electronic and print media in Lagos were decorated as champions of SDGs and inducted into the Nigeria Network of Sustainable Development Journalists (NNSDJ). Gbenga Omotosho, Lagos commissioner for information and strategy, represented by Olusina Thorpe, permanent secretary in the ministry, decorated the journalists with SDG wheel-pins. Also present were representatives of the office of the senior special assistant to the president on SDGs (OSSAP-SDGs).
