The Nigeria Centre for Disease Control (NCDC) says there have been 15 confirmed cases of monkeypox in the country in 2022. The agency said this in a statement on Thursday. It said since the re-emergence of monkeypox in Nigeria in September 2017, the country has continued to record sporadic cases of the disease from states across the country. It added that between September 2017 and April 30, 2022, a total of 558 cases and eight deaths have been confirmed across 22 states. “Of these, 15 cases have been confirmed in 2022 alone — this does not constitute an outbreak,” the statement reads. “We re-assure Nigerians of the NCDC’s capacity to effectively diagnose and respond to cases of Monkeypox. “The National Reference Laboratory (NRL) in Abuja has the capacity to test for cases of Monkeypox with a quick turn-around time. We urge anyone who has fluid-filled body rashes (vesicular rash), enlargement of glands and other symptoms of monkeypox stated below to report to any public health facility near them for proper diagnosis and care.” On the case of monkeypox recently detected in the United Kingdom in an individual said to have travelled from Nigeria, the NCDC said it was officially notified by UK authorities of the case of monkeypox on May 7. The agency said the individual is a UK resident who arrived in Nigeria on April 20, 2022, and travelled to Lagos and Delta states during the time spent in Nigeria. The agency said the individual departed Lagos on May 3, 2022, and arrived in the UK the next day. “While in Nigeria, the case did not report being in contact with anyone with symptoms of monkeypox or other illness with rash,” the statement reads. “The diagnosis of monkeypox (West African clade) was confirmed by PCR in the UK on 6th May, 2022. The patient is currently stable and receiving care in the UK.” The NCDC added that it is investigating the incident in collaboration with the ministries of health in Lagos and Delta states.
