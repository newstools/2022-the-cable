The death toll from the collapsed building in Ebute-Meta, Lagos state, has risen to eight. Ibrahim Farinloye, south-west zonal coordinator of the National Emergency Management Agency (NEMA), confirmed the casualty figure on Monday. The deceased include five males and three females. The three-storey building collapsed on Sunday night, trapping many in the rubble. Earlier, two bodies, that of a mother and child, were recovered from the debris. About 23 occupants of the building have been rescued. According to Farinloye, rescue operations are ongoing at the site of the incident. Operatives of the Lagos State Fire and Rescue Service, the Lagos State Ambulance Service (LASAMBUS), and the Lagos State Building Control Agency (LASBCA) are at the scene to rescue trapped victims. The building collapse is the second in the Yaba-Ebute-Meta axis in the past two months. On February 13, a three-storey building collapsed in the Onike area of Yaba, leading to several casualties. The developer of the project was said to have returned to the site despite a stop-work order on the structure.
