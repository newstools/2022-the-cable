Blessing Oborududu has secured a record eleventh consecutive gold medal at the ongoing 2022 African Wrestling Championship (AWC) in Morocco. Oborududu defeated Menatalla Ahmed Osman Mostafa Badran of Egypt in the final of the women’s under-68kg category at El Jadida on Saturday night. Ranim Saidi of Tunisia won the bronze after beating DR Congo’s Rose Kabeya Tabora. Oborududu, the Olympic silver medalist, has been the dominant force at continental level. The 33-year-old now has 11 gold medals at the African championships since her maiden title in 2010. Meanwhile, Odunayo Adekuoroye will be hoping to claim her sixth continental title on Sunday in the women’s 59kg category. The World championship silver medallist will hope to top the podium in the build-up to the Birmingham 2022 Commonwealth Games, where she will seek a third consecutive title.
