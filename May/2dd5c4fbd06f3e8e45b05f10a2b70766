Olabisi Kayode, the candidate of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) in the June 18 Ekiti governorship election, is trailing the flagbearers of the All Progressives Congress (APC) and the Social Democratic Party (SDP), according to a recent survey conducted for Anap Foundation by NOI Polls. In a press released signed by Atedo Peterside, president and founder of Anap Foundation, Abiodun Ayobami Oyebanji (APC) and Olusegun Adebayo Oni (SDP) are running “neck and neck”. Most of the polled voters indicated they would vote for either Oyebanji or Oni but the actual percentages were not disclosed in the statement. “However, it is important to note that a whopping 33% of those polled are still undecided as to their choice of candidate; and it is believed this proportion of voters would be critical in deciding who eventually wins the coveted seat,” the statement reads. “While the survey results show that youths between the ages of 18-25 years are more inclined to vote for Olabisi Kayode, (they also had the largest proportion of undecided (50%) it also shows that a larger range of youths aged 26-35 & the next age bracket 36-45, are more inclined to vote for Olusegun Adebayo Oni.” While as many as 93 percent of registered voters polled have their permanent voter cards, 79 percent of them said that they were “absolutely certain” that they will vote in the lection. “Even if the voters only partially live up to their claim, then the pointers are that voter apathy may not rear its ugly head in the same magnitude as it did in the Anambra Governorship elections where approximately 90% of the registered voters failed to vote on election day,” the statement noted.
