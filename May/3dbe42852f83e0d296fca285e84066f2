The jersey worn by Diego Maradona, the late Argentinian football legend, against England in the 1986 World Cup has sold for a world record £7.1 million at an auction at Sotheby’s in London. The final price makes the shirt the world’s most expensive piece of sports memorabilia. Maradona wore the shirt in the quarterfinal against England, and got a brace for Argentina as the South Americans won 2-1. The first is one of the most controversial goals in football. Maradona leapt into a floating cross and punched the ball past England goalkeeper Peter Shilton. The goal was later dubbed the “hand of God.” His second goal was named Goal of the Century by FIFA. Maradona dribbled through the England team and lobbed it over a prone Shilton to give Argentina a 2-0 lead. Maradona, who died in November 2020, exchanged his shirt with England’s Steve Hodge after the game. The former Tottenham midfielder thereafter placed the jersey up for auction. It has now surpassed the previous record for a match-worn jersey, which was the £4.4 million paid in 2019 on Babe Ruth’s 1928-1930 New York Yankees jersey and the £7 million paid for the original hand-drawn Olympic manifesto that was sold in New York that same year. Maradona was regarded as one of the greatest footballers in the game’s history.  He was inspirational for Argentina as they went on to win the 1986 World Cup.
