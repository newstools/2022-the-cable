The Kaduna chapter of the Christian Association of Nigeria (CAN) has condemned the killing of a woman and her children in Anambra state. The incident was said to have taken place in a community in Orumba north LGA of the state over the weekend and has elicited criticism from many Nigerians. The woman, identified as Fatima, was said to be a northerner resident in Anambra. In a statement on Tuesday, Joseph Hayab, CAN chairman in Kaduna, said the association has read the story of the killing of with “sadness and disappointment”. “Life in our country has become so cheap with the raising of many evil criminal groups in every part of the country,” the statement reads. “CAN sees the massacre of Fatima, her unborn child, and four children by criminals and terrorists in Anambra as bad for Nigeria’s peace and unity. “CAN cannot keep quiet when evil is destroying the land. We all must know that when there is an injury to one, then that injury is to all and evil only triumphs when good people keep quiet and look the other way. “CAN therefore is urging the federal government to go after Fatima’s murderers and all others who have killed any Nigerian from any region or of any identity. “Until our government and our law enforcement agencies go after all criminals and murderers and justice is seen to have been done on all murderers, this evil will not stop and the murderers will not see their crime as evil, but instead, they will smartly make us fight amongst ourselves and pay less attention to their crime. “CAN, Kaduna state, commiserates with Fatima’s family and prays to God for comfort. “CAN will also continue to preach peace, pray for peace, and speak truth to power and against every wrongdoing in Kaduna state and Nigeria as a whole, because we believe that an injury to one is an injury to all. “May God deliver Nigeria from bloodthirsty criminals.”
