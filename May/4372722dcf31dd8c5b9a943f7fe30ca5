Anyim Pius Anyim, presidential hopeful on the platform of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP), says he will stabilise Nigeria within six months if elected. The former senate president said this when he paid a visit to Sule Lamido, former governor of Jigawa, in Dutse, the capital of the state. Anyim said stabilising the country will enable it to thrive and prosper. “We must agree on the things that divide us. We must come to terms with what works for us. I will provide the platform to midwife this consensus,” he said. “We will all work together to make Nigeria great again. I will provide that distinctive leadership that will build consensus across the country and reconcile Nigerians. “I promise that within the first six months of my administration, I will stabilise this country and prepare it for growth, peace and prosperity.” Anyim, who spoke to party delegates in the state before heading to see Lamido, promised that if elected president, he will expand the state’s agricultural initiative. “Jigawa state, besides agricultural produce, has a lot more to export to other parts of Nigeria,” he said. In April, while addressing the national working committee (NWC) of the PDP in Abuja, Anyim said he should be recalled if he fails to perform after one year. The former secretary to the government of the federation had said he has the experience to lead the country to glory if elected president. “Mr. Chairman, if I run this country for one year and you don’t see the difference between light and darkness, recall me,” he had said.
