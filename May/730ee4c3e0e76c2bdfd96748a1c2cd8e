Frank Nweke II, a former minister of information, has won the All Progressives Grand Alliance (APGA) governorship primary in Enugu state. In April, Nweke declared his intention to contest the Enugu governorship seat on the platform of APGA – after defecting from the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP). The former minister polled 273 votes to defeat his closest rival, Jeff Nnamani, an executive director (strategy) at Total Nigeria Plc, who scored 267 votes. Uchenna Okogbuo, chairman of the electoral committee, declared the result of the election on Sunday. Others contenders who took part in the election include Udeh Donatus (two votes), Nwegbo Uchenna (nine votes), and Ozoemena Obi Donatus (four votes). There were a total of 555 accredited voters out of the 732 delegates that took part in the exercise. Also, there was no invalid vote. The former minister also took to his official Twitter page to announce his victory. “I am honored to accept the nomination of the All Progressives Grand Alliance #APGA as the party’s flagbearer for the 2023 gubernatorial election in Enugu State,” the tweet reads. “I thank all the Enugu APGA delegates for the faith shown in me and in my vision for Enugu. #Okeifufe2023 #Enugu2023.” Nweke is a Nigerian politician who was minister of youth, minister of information and then minister of information and communications during the second term of former President Olusegun Obasanjo.
