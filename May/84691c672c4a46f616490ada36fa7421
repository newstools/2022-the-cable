Tein Jack-Rich, founder of Belemaoil Producing Limited and presidential aspirant on the platform of the All Progressives Congress (APC), has formally declared his presidential bid. Speaking on Friday at his official declaration in Abuja, Jack-Rich said if elected president, he would be pragmatic in addressing the challenges confronting the country. The presidential hopeful also said he would not take loans to execute projects for the country. “I am not going to take a single loan during my presidency. The reason we are struggling with inflation is because we are not consuming what we are producing,” he said. “I will create smart jobs and will develop the oil and gas industry and optimise the oil and gas in the country. “My presidency will strengthen our value system. We will create 26,000 jobs in each LGA on the first day in office. “I will make it happen. When I create 26,000 direct opportunity jobs on the first day in office in the 774 LGAs, within one year, poverty will flee.” The presidential hopeful also said if elected, the country’s economic resources would be used for the people. “You need a president that can think for you, not himself. You need a president that will ensure the wealth in Niger Delta is not for the region alone but a president who can utilise it for the benefit of all,” he said. “With the Jack-Rich presidency, we will produce more, plan more and be respected in the community of nations. We will strengthen our currency and create jobs for youths.”
