Flying Eagles of Nigeria have won the WAFU B U20 Championship after defeating the Young Squirrels of Benin Republic 3-1 in the final. The match was played on Friday night at the Stade General Seyni Kountché in Niamey, the capital of the Niger Republic. Tolulope Ojo of Remo stars was the standout performer who earned himself the man of the match award. His 38th-minute opener began what will culminate into a historic night for the Eagles. Ojo also made it two for Nigeria in the 62nd minute, while Ibrahim Muhammad, a forward who plays for Maikunkele FC, made it 3-0 with 16 minutes to go when he cleverly won the ball — as the Beninoise goalkeeper tried to launch an attack — and then heaved it over the goalie’s head. The Beninoise scored a consolation goal with a few minutes to the end — but it was too little and late to spur any resurgence as Nigeria went on to lift the zonal cup. Nigeria and the Benin Republic will fly the WAFU B zone’s flag at the 2023 Africa U20 Cup of Nations (AFCON) in Egypt billed for February 18, to March 12. The top four teams from the championship will qualify for the FIFA U20 World Cup held in Indonesia later that same year.
