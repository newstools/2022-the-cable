The Lagos government has ordered the immediate stoppage of approval for structures above three floors in Ebute Metta east and west axis of the state. Idris Salako, the state commissioner for physical planning and urban development, in a statement on Wednesday, said the decision followed an audit of buildings in the area. He said the low-lying nature of Ebute Metta and its negative impact on some of the buildings, most of which showed severe defects, made it mandatory for the government to apply special measures to save lives and property. “The soil and topography, the low water level and effects, as well as the inability of structures in this area to bear loads above three floors, were considered in arriving at this decision,” Salako said. “The Lagos State Physical Planning Permit Authority (LASPPPA) has been directed to henceforth stop taking applications for approval above three floors in the area. “To guarantee safety of lives and property by ensuring that we put a halt to lives being cut short by incidents of building collapse, the government has been compelled to invoke the relevant sections of the Lagos State Urban and Regional Planning and Development Law 2019, as amended, to address the crisis.” The commissioner called for the understanding of stakeholders, adding that the decision is in the best interest of the state. On May 1, a three-story building collapsed in the area, killing 10 people, while 24 persons were rescued. Within the last three months, the building collapse was the second in the Yaba-Ebute Metta axis. Days before the latest incident, a three-story building had collapsed in the Ebute Metta area of the state, resulting in the death of several persons.
