Ohanaeze Ndigbo, apex socio-political organisation in the south-east, says no politician of south-east extraction should accept to be running mate to any presidential candidate in 2023. George Obiozor, president-general of Ohaneze Ndigbo, said this on Thursday at the Imeobi Ohaneze Ndigbo meeting in Enugu. Obiozor said the clamour for an Igbo to be elected president of Nigeria is justified and a project to which every Igbo must commit. “All the double dealings about zoning and rotation of power are orchestrated conspiracy to deprive the south-east of the right to produce the president,” he said. “I encourage all the presidential aspirants from the zone to remain focused, tenacious and optimistic.” He explained that the political action committee (PAC) of the Ohaneze Ndigbo would meet eminent Nigerians to persuade them on why a politician from the south-east should be elected as president of Nigeria. Obiozor also lamented the effects of the sit-at-home observed on Mondays in the region, saying the south-east is recording huge losses. “Ndigbo has tried severally to persuade the youths to realise the consequences of their actions,’’ he added. Among prominent lgbo leaders in attendance at the meeting were John Nwodo, former president-general of the group; Victor Umeh, former national chairman of the All Progressives Grand Alliance (APGA); and Peter Umeadi, former chief judge of Anambra.
