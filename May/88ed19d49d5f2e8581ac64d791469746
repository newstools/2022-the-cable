Karim Benzema scored the winning goal as Real Madrid rose from the ashes to overcome Manchester City 3-1 in the second leg of their UEFA Champions League (UCL) semi-final encounter at the Santiago Bernabeu on Wednesday night. The enthralling encounter, in which Real Madrid looked buried until the final minutes, sees the 13-time UCL winners advance into the final of the competition. Riyad Mahrez’s goal had put Man City in a commanding position before Rodrygo’s brace in the final minutes and Karim Benzema’s penalty in the first half extra-time put the visitors to the sword and send Real Madrid to the final of this year’s Champions League. Speaking after the match, Carlo Ancelotti, Madrid coach, said: “What happened tonight also happened against Chelsea, but it’s really difficult to say why. It’s the big history of this club, which helps us to keep going when things are gone. “The game was close to finished, but we were able to find some energy. We played a good game against a really strong rival. Psychologically we were better in extra time. “I never thought we had lost, I had no time to think about it. I am really happy to be in Paris against a really great rival. I think it will be a fantastic game of football.” This will be the 17th final for Real Madrid as they face Liverpool in Paris on May 28 in a repeat of 2018 final. The defeat prevents a fourth all-English final and is yet another heartache for Man City and their manager Pep Guardiola — in their quest to claim the Champions League trophy.
