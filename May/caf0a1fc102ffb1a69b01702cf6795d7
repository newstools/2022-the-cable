Manchester City won the English Premier League (EPL) title following a come-from-behind 3-2 victory over Aston Villa at the Etihad Stadium on the final day of the league. The win on Sunday sees Pep Guardiola’s Man City successfully defend their EPL title, making it the Abu Dhabi-backed side’s sixth league title. Matty Cash and Philipe Coutinho had given Aston Villa a 2-0 advantage before Man City scored three times in five minutes late in the second half. A brace from Ilkay Gundogan, a substitute, and Rodi helped City snatch victory from the jaws of defeat and with it the EPL title. A nervous Man City fell to Cash’s header in the 37th minute before Coutinho doubled Steven Gerard’s side’s lead in 69 minutes. The introduction of Gundogan changed the dynamics of the encounter, with the German international heading into the net before Rodri drilled in the equalizer two minutes later. Gundogan completed the comeback from Kevin de Bruyne’s cross to send the fans into frenzy mode as Guardiola’s side clinched the club’s fourth title in five years, punctured by the 2020 triumph of Liverpool, who finished second despite a 3-1 win over Wolves. Manchester City finished the league with 93 points, one point ahead of Liverpool in second place. Elsewhere, Tottenham won 5-0 at Norwich to secure the fourth position and qualified for next season’s UEFA champions league ahead of Arsenal who also won 5-1 against Everton at the Emirates stadium. At the bottom of the table, Burnley lost 2-1 at home to Newcastle United to suffer relegation into the championship as Leeds United saved their EPL status with a 2-1 win at Brentford. RESULTS
