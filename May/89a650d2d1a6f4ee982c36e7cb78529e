The Economic and Financial Crimes Commission (EFCC) says its operatives invaded the home of Rochas Okorocha, former Imo governor, over his refusal to appear during trial. Earlier on Tuesday, operatives of the EFCC had besieged Okorocha’s house, located at 3, Nyase close, off Ontario crescent, Maitama, Abuja, to arrest him. The senator representing Imo west, however, declined, insisting that he will not submit himself to the anti-graft agency without a warrant. In a statement on Tuesday, Wilson Uwujaren, EFCC’s spokesperson, said the invasion of the senator’s home was linked to the agency’s case against him. “The move followed the refusal of the former governor to honour invitations after jumping the administrative bail earlier granted him by the commission,” the statement reads. “EFCC had on January 24, 2022 filed a 17-count criminal charge bordering on diversion of public funds and properties to the tune of N2.9 billion against Okorocha. “The case was assigned to Honourable Justice Inyang Ekwo of the federal high court, Abuja but attempts to arraign Senator Okorocha were twice stalled owing to the absence of the ex-governor who evaded service of processes. “At the last adjourned date, March 28th, 2022, Justice Ekwo before adjourning until May 30th, 2022, had warned that it was “the last adjournment I shall grant in this matter”. “In the circumstances, the commission is left with no option than to effect the arrest of Senator Okorocha and bring him to trial.”
