Kautukari, a community in Chibok LGA of Borno state, is currently under attack by suspected fighters of the Islamic State of West Africa Province (ISWAP). A resident told TheCable that the insurgents invaded the community around 6pm on Tuesday and started shooting randomly. The suspected ISWAP fighters are reportedly setting houses ablaze while locals are fleeing into the bush for safety. Soldiers stationed at a military forward operation base (FOB) in Kada, two kilometres away from Kautukari, were said to have been dislodged. TheCable, however, understands that troops have been mobilised from the army’s 117 battalion in Chibok town to the area. Kautukari is 17km away from Chibok town. Efforts to reach Onyema Nwachukwu, army spokesman, for comments on the incident were not successful as he didn’t respond to calls or text message. Meanwhile, the development comes months after suspected Boko Haram insurgents attacked Kawtakare, Korohuma and Pemi in Chibok LGA. Four persons were reportedly killed in the attack while a total of 110 building were set ablaze by the insurgents. During the attack on January 14, the insurgents were said to have invaded the area with different of weapons and started shooting sporadically. “They first went to the market area as today is our market day, and they looted almost everything,” one of the villagers had said. “After that, they set the market on fire. And then they started burning the houses. They also burnt this big church in the village.”
