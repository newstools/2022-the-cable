A Kano high court has sentenced Ibrahim Khalil, a 19-year-old Kano resident, to death for kidnapping and killing Ahmad Ado, his five-year-old nephew. Ado was said to have died after his mouth and nose were sealed with a tape when he was abducted. The five-year-old was later reportedly buried him in a shallow grave. Usman Na’abba, the presiding judge, while giving the ruling on Monday, sentenced Khalil to death by hanging. Lamido Sorondinki, prosecution counsel, told the court that Khalil killed his nephew in 2019 at Karkasara quarters in Kano. According to the prosecutor, the offence is contrary to sections 274 and 221 (a) of the Penal Code. “The defendant kidnapped his sister’s son, Ado, and in the process, used a seal tape to cover his nose and mouth, resulting in suffocation leading to his death,” Sorondinki told the court. “He buried him in a shallow grave at Sabuwar Sheka, Kano.” The prosecution also brought three witnesses before the court, and presented four exhibits to prove its case against the defendant. However, according to NAN, Khalil pleaded not guilty to the charges. The judge, however, said the prosecution proved it case against the defendant. The development comes months after Abdulmalik Tanko, a teacher in Kano, was arrested over his alleged involvement in the kidnap and killing of Hanifa Abubakar, a five-year-old pupil. The pupil was reportedly kidnapped in December, and her abductors were said to have asked for N6 million ransom. Tanko, who confessed to the murder when he was paraded by the police, said he killed Hanifa because she recognised him. However, after he was arraigned, Tanko pleaded not guilty to the charges filed against him.
