Bashir Ahmad, personal assistant to President Muhammadu Buhari on new media, has lost his bid to represent Gaya/Ajingi/Albasu constituency of Kano state in the house of representatives. Ahmad, a member of the All Progressives Congress (APC), had contested against Mahmud Gaya, the lawmaker who currently represents the constituency in the house of representatives. According to the result announced after the conclusion of the primary exercise, the presidential aide secured a total of 16 votes, while Gaya polled 109 votes. A breakdown of the result, as announced on Friday night, showed that Gaya secured 45, 36, and 28 votes in Gaya, Ajingi, and Albasu LGAs, respectively, while Ahmad got one, 11 and four in the three areas. With the result, Gaya secured the APC ticket to seek a second term in the house of representatives in the 2023 elections. Ahmad was said to have left the venue of the primary before the conclusion of the exercise. Speaking on the development in a statement on his Facebook page, the presidential aide said he left the venue of the primary over security concerns. “As an aspirant, I left the venue of primary election for Gaya, Ajingi and Albasu Federal Constituency, because of the security of our majority delegates. If want to compete with the best, thugs shouldn’t be part of any election,” he wrote.
