The police service commission (PSC) has confirmed the promotion of Ibrahim Magu, former acting chairman of the Economic and Financial Crimes Commission (EFCC), to the position of assistant inspector-general of police (AIG). Ikechukwu Ani, PSC spokesperson, announced the development in a statement issued on Monday. “The eight Commissioners of Police promoted to AIGs were; CP Mustafa Magu Ibrahim who is the most senior in the CP cadre and who missed the last two promotions after returning to the Police; Abraham Egong Ayim; Okunlola Kola Kamaldeen; Andrew Amieengheme; Akeera Mohammed Younous; Celestine Amechi Elumelu; Ngozi Vivian Onadeko and Danladi Bitrus Lalas (Airwing),” the statement reads. The development comes amid Magu’s expected retirement from the Nigeria Police Force (NPF), having clocked the mandatory retirement age of 60 on May 5. In July 2020, when Magu was still at the helm of affairs in the EFCC, he was arrested, detained, and suspended as the acting chairman of the anti-graft agency — after he appeared before a panel probing allegations of gross misconduct The panel, led by Justice Ayo Salami, subsequently recommended Magu’s removal as EFCC boss “for failing to properly account for N431,000,000.00 security votes/information fund released to the office of the Executive Chairman of EFCC between November 2015 and May 2020”. The panel further recommended that Magu should be referred to the inspector-general of police (IGP) for “necessary disciplinary action”, and that he should be prosecuted over the alleged offences. Despite the recommendation of the panel, Magu resumed duties at the police headquarters as commissioner of police — his rank before he was appointed acting EFCC chairman. In July 2021, TheCable had reported that Magu was being considered for promotion to the rank of AIG despite the report of the Salami panel.
