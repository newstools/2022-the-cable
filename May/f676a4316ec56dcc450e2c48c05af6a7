Samuel Kanu, prelate of the Methodist Church Nigeria (MCN), has regained freedom from captivity. The prelate was abducted by gunmen on Sunday afternoon along the Enugu-Port Harcourt expressway in Umunneochi LGA of Abia state. Dennis Mark, the bishop of Owerri, as well as another cleric, were also kidnapped during the attack. Earlier on Monday, Michael Akinwale, secretary of conference, MCN, in a statement, said the abductors demanded a ransom of N100 million. “The devastating news of the abduction of our prelate, the bishop of Owerri, and the prelate’s chaplain has left everybody in shock,” Akinwale had said. “This is a period of trial in which the church must cry out that ‘the Lord that answereth by fire’ must be our God to destroy all the manipulations of the adversary. Let us all arise and cry out to the Lord! “As we engage in prayer warfare, this serves to notify you that the abductors have demanded a ransom of N100 million.” Geoffery Ogbonna, police spokesman in Abia, confirmed the release of the clerics to TheCable on Monday evening. “They have regained their freedom this evening,” Ogbonna said. It is, however, not clear if ransom was paid for the release of the abductees.
