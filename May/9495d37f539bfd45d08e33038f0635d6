A federal high court in Abuja has further shifted the case of Nnamdi Kanu, leader of the Indigenous People of Biafra (IPOB), to June 28. Binta Nyako, the presiding judge, had earlier fixed May 26 for the continuation of the trial. However, in a statement on Wednesday, Ifeanyi Ejiofor, one of Kanu’s lawyers, said he received a notice from the court that the judge is “indisposed”. “Please be informed that we have just received communication from the federal high court’s registrar, notifying us that the court will no longer be sitting tomorrow,  May 26, 2022, on Onyendu Mazi Nnamdi Kanu’s case,” he said. Kanu was re-arraigned on an amended 15-count charge bordering on treasonable felony. However, on April 8, the judge struck out eight of the 15-count charge. While counts 6,7,9,10,11,12,13 and 14 were struck out, the defendant is to stand trial on counts 1,2,3,4,5,8 and 15. Also, Mike Ozekhome, Kanu’s lead counsel, had moved an application for bail. He begged the court to consider the deteriorating health condition of the defendant. But ruling on the bail application on May 18, the judge held that “the application is premature and refused with liberty to refile and reapply”. Nyako recalled that she granted the defendant bail in April 2017 after which he jumped bail. She said until the defendant addresses the court on why he jumped bail for over four years, she will not grant any bail application.
