Ebelechukwu Obiano, wife of Willie Obiano, former Anambra governor, has won the Anambra north senatorial primary of the All Progressives Grand Alliance (APGA). According to Ikenna Osuji, the returning officer of the primary election committee, Obiano polled 152 votes to defeat Primus Odili, her husband’s former chief of staff, at the election held on Sunday at the Chuba Ikpeazu stadium in Onitsha. Odili polled 120 votes, while two other aspirants, Sam Onwuteaka and Tony Nnacheta, got two votes each. The poll, according to Osuji, was calm, with delegates and candidates behaving in an orderly manner. Obiano is seeking the Anambra north senatorial seat which is currently held by Stella Oduah, former aviation minister. While declaring her senatorial bid in March, she said her decision to run for the office is because of “pressure from my people”. Obiano said contesting the office in the general election “is the will of God”. Meanwhile, the party’s primary for the senatorial district of Anambra south was inconclusive. A new date is yet to be fixed. The Anambra south district election is being contested by Chris Azubogu, Akachukwu Nwamkpo, and Ben Nwankwo.
