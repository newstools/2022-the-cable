Matthew Kukah, Catholic bishop of Sokoto diocese, has debunked the viral posts on social media that his residence has been set on fire in Sokoto state. On Saturday, some rioters had taken over major roads in Sokoto over the arrest of the suspected killers of Deborah Samuel, a female student of Shehu Shagari College of Education. A mob killed Deborah over alleged blasphemy on Thursday. Some social media users have shared different posts, including videos and pictures, allegedly from the unrest in the state. Catholic Broadcast Commission, Nigeria, a Facebook page with over 90,000 followers, made a post earlier in the day that Kukah’s house has been set ablaze by the rioters. “Carnage in Sokoto today: Aftermath of violent protest in Sokoto today. Holy Family Catholic Cathedral, Bishop Kukah’s house and Catholic Pastoral Centre which were built with over N1 billion naira have been burnt down by hoodlums who are protesting the arrest of those who murdered Miss Deborah Yakubu,” the post read. <img class="alignnone size-large wp-image-698961" src="https://f5p3e9e4.stackpathcdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/IMG-20220514-WA0015-661x1024.jpg" alt="" width="661" height="1024" srcset="https://f5p3e9e4.stackpathcdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/IMG-20220514-WA0015-661x1024.jpg 661w, https://f5p3e9e4.stackpathcdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/IMG-20220514-WA0015-194x300.jpg 194w, https://f5p3e9e4.stackpathcdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/IMG-20220514-WA0015-15x24.jpg 15w, https://f5p3e9e4.stackpathcdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/IMG-20220514-WA0015-23x36.jpg 23w, https://f5p3e9e4.stackpathcdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/IMG-20220514-WA0015-31x48.jpg 31w, https://f5p3e9e4.stackpathcdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/IMG-20220514-WA0015.jpg 697w" sizes="(max-width: 661px) 100vw, 661px" /> The post has generated over 460 comments, 400 shares and 560 likes.
