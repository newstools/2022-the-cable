Samuel Ortom, governor of Benue state, has won the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) ticket to contest for a seat in the senate. The governor will fly the PDP flag in the Benue north-west senatorial district election in 2023. Ortom, on Monday, clinched the party’s senatorial ticket unchallenged. The Benue governor was first elected on the All Progressives Congress (APC) ticket in 2015 but was re-elected in 2019 on the PDP platform. Similarly, Ibrahim Dankwambo, former governor of Gombe state, won the ticket to represent the PDP in the Gombe north senatorial district poll. Habu Zarma, the returning officer, said Dankwambo emerged the winner of the exercise after Bayero Nafada, a former deputy speaker of the house of representatives, and Hamma Saleh withdrew from the race. He said all the 144 delegates who took part in the exercise voted for the former governor. Dankwambo was the governor of Gombe state from 2011 to 2019. Meanwhile, Darius Ishaku, Taraba state governor, has also secured the PDP ticket to contest the Taraba south senatorial district election. Like Ortom, the Taraba governor was also unchallenged in the election. In Jigawa, Ibrahim Saminu Turaki, a former governor of the state, won the PDP ticket to represent the party in the Jigawa north-west senatorial election next year.
