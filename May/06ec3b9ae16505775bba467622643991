Peter Obi, former governor of Anambra, has been declared the winner of the Labour Party (LP) presidential primary. The former Anambra governor won the LP presidential primary, which took place in Asaba, Delta state, on Monday. He was declared winner of the primary around 4:50pm. Pat Utomi, a professor of political economy, Eragbe Anselm, national youth leader of LP, as well as Olubusola Olufolake, had earlier stepped down from the presidential race. On Friday, the former Anambra governor joined LP, hours after announcing the resignation of his membership of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP). He said his decision to join LP aligns with the interest of Nigerians across different sectors, adding that he wants to take the country from consumption to production. “Therefore, I have chosen a route that I consider to be in line with our aspirations and my mantra of taking the country from consumption to production; and that is the Labour Party which is synonymous with the people, workers, development, production, securing and uniting Nigerians as one family,” Obi had said.
