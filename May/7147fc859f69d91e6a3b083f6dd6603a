Abdullahi Ganduje, governor of Kano, has obtained the senatorial form of the All Progressives Congress (APC). The 72-year-old politician will be vying to represent Kano north senatorial district at the red chamber. The seat is presently occupied by Barau Jibrin. On May 8, Ganduje had endorsed Nasiru Gawuna, his deputy, to become the next governor of the state, while Murtala Garo, former commissioner for local government and chieftaincy affairs, was reportedly selected to be Gawuna’s running mate in the 2023 governorship election. Ganduje was deputy to Rabiu Kwankwaso from 1999 to 2003 and 2011 to 2015. He later succeeded his principal in 2015 and he is to complete his two terms as governor on May 29, 2023.
