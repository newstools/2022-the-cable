Bitcoin, the world’s largest crypto by market cap, has dropped 5 percent to $29,594. On Monday, the bitcoin price dropped below the $40,000 benchmark to $32,832. In July 2021, bitcoin had sold at $29,806 and experienced an upward movement until November when it dropped again. According to CoinMarketCap, the price of bitcoin stands at $29,594 on Thursday at 17:00 GMT+1. Stability in the price of bitcoin has been a struggle, as it keeps bouncing between beating the benchmark and maintaining it. Lately, the price of bitcoin has been floating within $30,000, which has caused more worries about the risks of larger losses as it keeps falling below expectations. Similarly, more coins have dropped lower in less than 48 hours. Ethereum (ETH) fell 16 percent to $1,949, Shiba Inu (SHIB) dropped 22 percent to $0.00001067, and Solana (SOL) sold at $45. The dip affects the global cryptocurrency market cap which fell to $1.27 trillion and has wiped more than $1.5 trillion from the overall crypto market. The crypto market is said to be affected by the Russian-Ukraine crisis, and Covid-19 in China among other reasons. Also, more countries have restricted cryptocurrency transactions. The Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN) had placed a ban on cryptocurrency transactions in Nigerians. The apex bank claimed that they are largely used in terrorism financing, and money laundering, considering the anonymity of virtual transactions.
