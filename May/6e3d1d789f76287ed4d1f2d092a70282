Asisat Oshoala, Super Falcons striker, is the joint top scorer in the women’s Spanish Primera Division. The 27-year-old Nigerian achieved the feat despite missing three months of the season due to recurring injuries. She scored 20 goals in 19 league appearances for Barcelona Femeni and will share the award with Geyse Ferreira of Madrid CFF, who netted 20 goals in 27 appearances. Oshoala is now the first African woman to win the highest goalscorer gong in the Spanish Primera Division since it began in 2011. ᴘɪᴄʜɪᴄʜɪ @AsisatOshoala pic.twitter.com/kPiEekKy6j — FC Barcelona Femení (@FCBfemeni) May 15, 2022  The feat was confirmed on Sunday after Barcelona Femeni finished the season with a perfect tally of 30 wins — with no loss or draw. They defeated Atletico Madrid 2-1 at Estadi Johan Cruyff. Oshoala was introduced in the 63rd minute for Jenifer Hermoso, but she could not add to her tally of goals. Irene Paredes put the Blaugranes ahead in the 11th minute, while Aitana Bonmati made it 2-0 in the 23rd minute. Although Amanda Sampedro pulled a goal back for Atletico in the 64th minute, it was not enough to spoil the perfect season of the Blue and Red ladies — a season where they scored 159 goals and conceded only 11. Oshoala switched to Barcelona from Arsenal in July 2019.
