Shehu Kura, Kano commissioner for finance and economic development, has resigned from his position. A statement by Muhammad Garba, Kano commissioner for information, made available to TheCable on Thursday, indicated that Kura was appointed as commissioner at the request of Ibrahim Shekarau, former governor of Kano, after the 2019 elections. The former commissioner has also defected from the All Progressives Congress (APC) to the New Nigeria Peoples Party (NNPP) — hours after Shekarau joined the NNPP. TheCable had reported that the former Kano governor joined NNPP after months of leadership tussle with Abdullahi Ganduje, governor of Kano. Speaking on his decision to defect, Shekarau had said he joined the NNPP over the failure of the APC national leadership to address the underlying issues that led to the emergence of factions in the state chapter of the party. According to the statement issued by Garba on Thursday, Kura had previously served as commissioner for planning and budget. Meanwhile, TheCable understands that Kura has been selected as consensus candidate to represent Kura/Madobi/Garun Malam federal constituency on the NNPP platform in the 2023 general election. Aside from Shekarau and Kura, Abdulmumin Jibrin, a former federal lawmaker and APC stakeholder in Kano, also recently defected to the NNPP. Prior to his defection, Jibrin had been at the forefront of the presidential campaign for Bola Tinubu, an APC chieftain.
