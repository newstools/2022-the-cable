Ibikunle Amosun, former Ogun state governor, has declared his intention to run for president in 2023 on the platform of the All Progressives Congress (APC). The senator announced his presidential bid at an event in Abuja on Thursday. His declaration comes a day after Adams Oshiomhole, former APC national chairman, and Kayode Fayemi, governor of Ekiti, announced their presidential bid. “My wide range experiences in both the private and public sector in political parties and political alliances in two of the three branches of government, that is the legislative and executive arm, and also at every level of government have given me the requisite insights and political vision and deep understanding and strength of Nigeria’s diversity adequate to provide the needed leadership that will galvanise our country to achieve our manifest destiny as the leading nation, not only in Africa but in the black world,” he said. “Today, I’m formally announcing my candidacy for the presidential ticket of our great party, the All Progressives Congress and the presidency of the federal republic of Nigeria. “I am so conscious of the immensity of the task that lies ahead in our country and the magnitude of the sacrifice anybody who wishes to lead our country into the next phase must make. “This is to honour the historic call and duty to honour the next phase of our collective journey to national glory. It is a duty to renergise our faith in the future of country even in the face of threats to our national sovereignty by insurgents and terrorists.  A duty to renew hope in our collective destiny even in the light of some doubts expressed and mobilised about our shared faith. “I’m therefore confident in the future of this country and the great possibilities that lie ahead for us as a free people.”
