The second episode of Our Two Kobo, ‘Domestic Violence, Divorce and the Burden of Religion’, centres on the roles played by religion, society and the law in cases of domestic violence in Nigeria. Drawing insight from the death of Osinachi Nwachukwu, a gospel singer alleged to have been abused by her husband, Jam Jam and The Honourable raise questions on if divorce should be ruled out in an abusive home on the basis of religious beliefs, at what point in a marriage an abused partner should call it quits, and the complicity of the family system and society in silencing abuse victims. They also discuss the provisions of the law as it relates to domestic violence and provide a list of non-governmental organisations (NGOs) that an abused partner can reach out to for help.
