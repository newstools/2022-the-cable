Atiku Abubakar, former vice-president, says he will address the issue of devolution of powers if he becomes president in 2023. Atiku spoke on Saturday when he visited Abeokuta, the Ogun capital, to seek the support of delegates ahead of the presidential primary of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) scheduled for May 28. He met with  PDP leaders, including Ladi Adebutu, Ogun governorship aspirant, and Sikirullahi Ogundele, the state party chairman. The former vice-president said he is better qualified to be president due to his experience and maturity, adding that if he is voted into power, he would also focus on unity, security, economy, and education. “I promise to give every part of this country a sense of belonging as we did in the past,” NAN quoted him as saying. “When we came to power in 1999, we experienced lack of unity and the first thing we did was to form a government of national unity which engendered the peace we needed for successful governance. “I am going to tackle insecurity because once you tackle insecurity, there will be peace and when there is peace, you can now begin to implement economic reforms which will create jobs and bring about development. “I am also going to tackle the issue of decentralisation or rather, devolution of powers to the state and the local governments.” Speaking further, Atiku also explained why he did not visit Ogun during the 2019 presidential primary of the PDP. “I was angry with you people because you allowed outsiders from the south-west region to manipulate you and dictate the way you ran your affairs,” he said. “As long as there is disunity, you will continue to lose election in Ogun. “Ogun has provided political leadership for the entire nation several times and you are too politically sophisticated and advanced to allow outsiders to interfere in your affairs. “I am, however, happy because you are now united and I urge you to sustain this unity.”
