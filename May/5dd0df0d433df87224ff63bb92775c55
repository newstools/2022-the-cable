Mary Ikoku, chief executive officer (CEO) of Access Development Initiative, who is seeking to be elected into the house of representatives, has asked delegates of the All Progressives Congress (APC) to vote for her. Ikoku is seeking to represent Ohafia/Arochukwu federal constituency of Abia state in the lower legislative chamber. Speaking at a meeting with leaders of her party in Ohafia on Thursday, the hopeful said if elected, she would attract projects to the area. The hopeful said she intends to establish an ICT hub in the constituency. “When you look at what our people are going through, it brings tears to the eyes. For instance, the only road that connects these two brothers has become a reproach, standing as a division to us,” she said. “It has degenerated from a road to a meter path that commuters are scared of plying. We will ensure that this road is fixed. “I flew into Uyo airport from Abuja after my screening and came by road all the way from Uyo airport, it was a freeway all through Akwa Ibom, but once we entered Abia state, we were greeted by bad roads. Why must our state be replete with bad roads? “As your representative in this constituency, projects will get to you. Our people in Ohafia and Arochukwu local governments will all bountifully benefit from the Constituency Projects. “Regarding our youth, you have to squarely address the problem of unemployment facing our youth before you start blaming them for what they are not doing well. We intend to launch IT hubs in this constituency.” Ikoku said she would focus on education, employment and empowerment, if elected.
