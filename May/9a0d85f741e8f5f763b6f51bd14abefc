Sunday Dare, minister of youth and sports development, has described Bayelsa state as the “wrestling glory of Nigeria” The minister said his comment was based on the state’s tradition of producing great wrestling talents and champions over the years. Dare, who was a special guest at the closing ceremony of the 1st Governor Diri National Wrestling Classics in Yenagoa on Tuesday night, said: “The wrestling glory of our country Nigeria is planted solidly in Bayelsa state. We have seen our stars come from the nooks and crannies of this state.” Last year, Bayelsa-born Blessing Oborududu became the first-ever Nigerian wrestler to win an Olympic medal after getting a silver medal in the 68kg class at the Tokyo 2020 games in Japan. The 10-time African champion Oborududu followed the footsteps of Daniel Igali, fellow Bayelsan and Nigeria Wrestling Federation (NWF) president, who won an Olympic gold medal for Canada at the Sydney 2000 Games, having previously represented Nigeria at different international competitions. “We have seen this state attract some great talents from across the country, and the Governor Diri National Classics is a testimony to that fact that Bayelsa State is the wrestling industry for Nigeria,” Dare also said. The minister, who commended the Bayelsa governor for his continuous investment in wrestling and other sports, also expressed confidence that the champions at the tournament would give Nigeria quality representation at the 2022 African Championships in Morocco later this month, and the Commonwealth Games in Birmingham in July.
