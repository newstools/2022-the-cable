Nigeria’s Remo Stars table tennis team was defeated 3-0 by the ENPPI sporting club of Egypt in the final of the 2022 ITTF African club championship. The Egyptian side leveraged their experience and exposure to make a light work of the Nigerians in the one-sided encounter at the Molade Okoya Thomas Hall, Teslim Balogun Stadium, on Wednesday. Buoyed by the brilliance and composure of Antoine Hachard, a Frenchman who captained the team, ENPPI exploited the inexperience and developing skills of the Nigerian side led by 17-year-old Taiwo Mati. Omeh Amadi was defeated 3-2 by Egypt’s Naom Ahmed in the first game of the match before Hachard thumped Mati 3-0. Solake Azeez failed to build on his first victory to capitulate 3-1 to Hussein Momen as the North Africans finished with a clean sweep. IUG Douala of Cameroon claimed bronze after defeating the Nigeria Security and Civil Defence Corps (NSCDC) team in the third-place match. In the women’s category, NSCDC’s fortune was reversed as they defeated Ocean Front 3-2 to claim the gold medal. Esther Oribamise and Fatima Bello exhibited elite mentality, placing them as two of the best home-based Nigerian female table tennis players. They held firm to rebuff the formidable challenge of Odusanya Abosede, Ojomu Ajoke and the 16-year-old Aiyelabegan Sukurat. With the completion of the club championship, ITTF Africa Cup is billed to commence also in Lagos, with Aruna Quadri, Funke Oshonaike, Edem Offiong, and Rilwan Akanbi expected to represent Nigeria.
