Ahmed Idris, the accountant general of the federation, has been suspended indefinitely by Zainab Ahmed, the minister of finance, budget and national planning. This is coming two days after his arrest by the Economic and Financial Crimes Commission (EFCC) over an alleged N80 billion fraud. In a letter dated May 18, 2022, Ahmed said the suspension “without pay” was to allow for “proper and unhindered investigation” in line with public service rules. He is not expected to come to the office or contact any official in his office except for any disciplinary hearing that may be advised. Idris was arrested in Kano state by the anti-graft agency. The EFCC said it is investigating the accountant-general over the alleged misappropriation of funds. The agency said it picked up Idris after he failed to respond to invitations by the commission to answer questions over the allegation. “Operatives of the Economic and Financial Crimes Commission, EFCC, on Monday, May 16, 2022, arrested serving Accountant General of the Federation, Mr. Ahmed Idris, in connection with diversion of funds and money laundering activities to the tune of N80billion (Eighty Billion Naira) only,” EFCC said. “The Commission’s verified intelligence showed that the AGF raked off the funds through bogus consultancies and other illegal activities using proxies, family members and close associates. “The funds were laundered through real estate investments in Kano and Abuja. “Mr. Idris was arrested after failing to honour invitations by the EFCC to respond to issues connected to the fraudulent acts.”
