President Muhammadu Buhari has commended the military on the security operations in the north-west targeted at ending banditry in the zone. States across the north-west have recorded attacks by bandits, which have led to killings, kidnappings and destruction of property, while hundreds of people have been displaced. According to a statement issued on Sunday by Garba Shehu, presidential spokesman, Buhari asked the troops to sustain the momentum, especially in Zamfara, in order to end the activities of bandits. While speaking on the anti-banditry operations, the president said although “there appears to be relative calm” in Zamfara, “with situations returning to normal in most parts and the rural communities ready to live their lives normally again”, incidents have been recorded in some communities. “We mustn’t allow the return of days when the bandits had a free hand to do as they wished,” he was quoted as saying. “The rural folk in Zamfara and elsewhere must be allowed to have peace. Therefore, the momentum that has been developed must be sustained in order to bring closure to the activities of these murderers.” Buhari also commiserated with the victims of recent attacks in Zamfara, adding that “the combined efforts of the federal and state governments must do all that can be done to bring an immediate end to the horrific killings”.
