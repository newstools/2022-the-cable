Mohammed Yohanna, north-east zonal chairman of the association of hunters/vigilantes, says members of his team have killed a Boko Haram commander and his deputy in Borno state. Yohanna, who said this on Tuesday in an interview with journalists, said there was a clash between insurgents and the hunters at Shaffa Taku village of Damboa LGA in Borno on Monday. He added that a motorcycle and an AK-47 rifle were recovered from the insurgents. “We acted on intelligence that was given by volunteers who hinted me about the movement of the insurgents who have been terrorising their communities in the last two weeks,” he said. “Upon receiving the information, I mobilised my team and stormed the spot in the evening at Shaffa Taku, which is a deserted community in Damboa. “Luckily, we sighted the terrorists numbering more than 20, riding on motorcycles. We engaged them in a gun battle, and we were able to kill the commander and his deputy, while several others fled with gunshot wounds. “We also recovered one motorcycle and one AK-47 rifle from the terrorists. I have informed the authorities of the 231 battalion in Biu, and we are going to meet today for onward handing over of the recovered AK-47 rifle and the motorcycle.” Yohanna also said the hunters recently apprehended some persons who allegedly supplied food items to insurgents. According to him, the suspects were found with the sum of N6.05 million at a village in Hawul council area. He said the arrested persons have been handed over to troops in Biu for further action.
