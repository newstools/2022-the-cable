Members of the house of representatives are scheduled to hold an emergency plenary on Monday. According to a statement issued on Saturday, Yahaya Danzaria, clerk of the house, said the legislators will discuss critical national issues. “This is to inform all Hon Members, staff, media and the general public that the House hereby recalls all Hon. Members for an emergency plenary session against Monday, 9th May, 2022 at 2:00pm,” the statement reads. “It is particularly intended to discuss critical issues of national importance. “The House regrets any inconvenience this short notice would have caused.” TheCable understands that part of the discussions at the emergency plenary will focus on the plan by domestic airlines to shut down flight operations from Monday over the hike in fuel price. Although the lower legislative chamber can hold plenary sessions on any given day, it isn’t very common for members to hold plenary on Monday. Tuesday, Wednesday and Thursday are the known days for plenary sitting. The last plenary session was held last Wednesday and the legislators were scheduled to resume sitting on May 24. Four executive bills — the Terrorism (Prohibition and Prevention) Act (Repeal and Enactment) Bill, 2022; Money Laundering (Prohibition) Act (Repeal and Enactment) Bill, 2022; Public Interest Disclosure and Protection Bill, 2022; and Witness Protection and Management Bill, 2022 were passed by the lawmakers before the adjournment of plenary.
