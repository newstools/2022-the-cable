Flying Eagles of Nigeria have beaten  Ghana 2-0 in their WAFU zone B U-20 championship opening game in Niamey, Niger. The Ladan Bosso boys dictated the pace from the blast of the whistle at the Stade Seyni Kountche on Sunday evening. Ibrahim Muhammad opened the scoring for the Flying Eagles in the 5th minute of play. Substitute Ahmad Abdullahi thereafter doubled the lead in the 78th minute to ensure that the Nigerian team took all the points. The Nigerian team will take on Burkina Faso in their second group B clash at the same venue on Wednesday. The Flying Eagles are the record winners of the U20 Africa Cup of Nations (AFCON), having won it seven times. They, however, missed out in the last edition in Mauritania. The next U20 AFCON tournament will take place in Egypt from February 18, 2023 to March 12, 2023. The top four teams from the championship will qualify for the FIFA U20 World Cup held in Indonesia later in that same year.
