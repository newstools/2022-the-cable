Sunday Onuoha, bishop of the Methodist Church Nigeria (MCN), has declared his intention to contest the Abia governorship in the 2023 elections. He announced his intention at a media briefing on Friday. The cleric, who said he had consulted widely before taking the decision, added that he would contest on the platform of the African Democratic Congress (ADC). Speaking at the media briefing, which also had his supporters in attendance, Onuoha said he has the needed experience to govern Abia. “I assure you that I do not take your support for granted. Change is possible, but it is a journey we must all must be resolute to take,” he said. “Unanimous in our belief that your call for me to contest will not be wasted, we will win together and hold ourselves and our hands in victory as I work to give our dear state, Abia state, positive transformation. “Without sounding immodest, I am that governor Ndi Abia have been praying and waiting for. I have garnered wealth of experience in administration, business, public and private sector, and of course, in religious sector, which is my place of primary assignment, calling and ministry.” He also described himself as “God’s own son to govern God’s own state”, adding that the process of choosing leaders in the past has been done wrongly. “Our leadership recruitment process has been wrongly driven. The hour has come to liberate Abia state. The time is now,” he added.
