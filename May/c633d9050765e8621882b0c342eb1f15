Cristiano Ronaldo has been named the English Premier League (EPL) player of the month for April. The 37-year-old was announced the gong winner in a post on the league’s verified Twitter page on Thursday. He beat seven others — including Kevin De Bruyne, Gabriel Jesus, Son Heung-min, Thiago, Nathan Collins, Bruno Guimaraes, and Leandro Trossard — to be crowned the best player in the English top-flight league last month. Cristiano Ronaldo is the @EASPORTSFIFA Player of the Month for the second time this season #PLAwards | @Cristiano | @ManUtd pic.twitter.com/lkryrExtoD — Premier League (@premierleague) May 12, 2022  The forward has now won player of the month for a sixth time, overtaking Wayne Rooney’s five to become the most of any Manchester United player in the competition. Ronaldo was the only light for the Red Devils in a bleak month of April that saw the Old Trafford side pick just four points from five matches. The Portuguese international scored five times in four games, including a crucial one to ensure a point against Chelsea FC. The six-time Ballon D’Or winner scored his 100th Premier League goal in a 3-1 defeat to Arsenal, while he also marked his 50th club hat-trick in a 3-2 win over Norwich City. He is now just one win away from joining the duo of Harry Kane and Kun Aguero at the summit of POTM awardees.
