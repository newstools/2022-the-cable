Asisat Oshoala, FC Barcelona Femeni striker, has returned to the fold of the Super Falcons of Nigeria for the upcoming 2022 Africa Women Cup of Nations (AFCON) in Morroco. According to the list released by the Nigeria Football Federation (NFF) on Monday, Randy Waldrum, Falcons’ head coach, invited 32 players to the team’s camp ahead of the competition. Oshoala, who recently became the first African woman to win the highest goalscorer gong in the Spanish Primera Division, led the list of invitees, having missed out on the team’s double-header friendlies with Canada to injury. TheCable had earlier reported how the 27-year-old was stripped of the team’s captaincy due to poor performance and rebellion. Also on the list are Chiamaka Nnadozie, Onome Ebi, Rasheedat Ajibade, Toni Payne, Francisca Ordega and Desire Oparanozie. The training camp will open on June 18 in Morrocco. The squad is expected to undergo two weeks of training before the final team is announced. The 12th AWCON is billed to hold from July 2 to 23, with Nigeria in Group C alongside South Africa, Botswana and Burundi.
