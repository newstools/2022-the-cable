The Kaduna airport has resumed flight operations two months after shutting down over an attack by gunmen. Faithful Hope-Ivbaze, acting general manager, corporate affairs, Federal Airports Authority of Nigeria (FAAN), confirmed this to TheCable on Monday. Hope-Ivbaze said flight operations commenced today. “Flight operations to Kaduna airport have commenced today with Azman Air,” she said. In March, TheCable reported how gunmen attacked the airport and killed a security guard. They were, however, repelled by security operatives. On its official Twitter account, Azman Air announced the resumption of flights to the Kaduna airport, making it the first airline to resume operations on the route since the incident. The airline had halted flight operations into Kaduna following the attack. “Azman Air landed at Kaduna Airport today 23rd May, 2022, to the elation and cheers of passengers, stakeholders, and staff,” Azman Air tweeted. “It was a defining moment for the aviation community as the airport is reopened after being closed for two months. It’s so exciting to be back!” Azman Air landed at #Kaduna Airport today 23rd May, 2022 to the elation and cheers of Passenger, Stakeholders and Staff.
