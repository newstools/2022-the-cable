Aminu Tambuwal, governor of Sokoto, has relaxed the 24-hour curfew imposed on the state following protests by youths. Some Muslim youths, on Saturday, took to the streets in Sokoto metropolis to protest against the arrest of the suspected killers of Deborah Samuel, a female student of Shehu Shagari College of Education. A mob had killed Deborah over alleged blasphemy on Thursday. Her killing sparked outrage and condemnation across the country, with Nigerians asking the government to fish out the perpetrators of the crime. Subsequently, the police command in Sokoto announced the arrest of two suspects in connection with the killing. But on Saturday, the Muslim youths protested the arrest of the suspects and asked the police to release them. In a statement issued on Monday, Isah Galadanci, commissioner of information, said Tambuwal ordered the relaxation of the 24-hour curfew following a security report. The commissioner added that the development will enable people to carry out their “legitimate businesses”. “Sequel to the briefing by the Security Heads in the State, the State Governor, Rt Hon Aminu Waziri Tambuwal, CFR Mutawallen Sokoto has ordered the relaxation of the 24-hour curfew in force in Sokoto metropolis,” the statement reads. “The revised curfew will now be from dusk to dawn in Sokoto township. This is with a view to afford people the window to pursue their legitimate businesses and other means of livelihood.” The government advised residents to “maintain peace in this regard, as it will not condone any breach of law and order in the state”.
