TheCable’s team of the week is set up in a 3-5-2 formation with Napoli’s Victor Osimhen and former Nasarawa United hotshot Silas Nwankwo leading the line. There are also places for Kelechi Iheanacho, Moses Simon, Joe Aribo, and Samuel Chukwueze. Francis Uzoho – Omonia Nicosia In a relegation play-off that Omonia Nicosia needed to win against Doxa, Francis Uzoho was brilliant behind the sticks for the visitors. Zaidu Sanusi – FC Porto The hosts ran riot over Vizela with their Nigerian import exploding at the flank. Semi Ajayi – West Bromwich Albion Tackles, clearances, and awareness. The lanky defender stood tall against Reading attackers. Calvin Bassey – Rangers He was peerless against Celtic. Moses Simon – Nantes The speedy winger tormented the opposition defence and was rewarded with two goals. Samuel Chukwueze – Villarreal Another day for the forward to increase his stock and he did so with a spectacular performance against Alaves. He was rewarded with a goal. Joe Aribo – Rangers Aribo once again proved his mettle with excellent passes and crosses in the 1-1 draw against Celtic. Alhassan Yusuf – Royal Antwerp Highly rated Yusuf peppered every Royal Union SG player that came his way. Just like his mentor Kante, the Hearts product covered every blade of the pitch. Kelechi Iheanacho – Leicester City Senior Man Kels looked sharp for the Foxes and netted their consolatory goal against Spurs. Victor Osimhen – Napoli Striker Osimhen was at his best once again as his team thrashed Sassuolo 6-1. He scored and created an assist. Silas Nwankwo – Mjallby When Mjallby needed someone to inspire them, Silas Nwankwo was the man as he netted a brilliant solo winner against Helsingborg.
