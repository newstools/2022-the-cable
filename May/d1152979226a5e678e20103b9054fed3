Vice-President Yemi Osinbajo says the federal government is making efforts to “re-engineer” the country’s security framework. Osinbajo said this on Friday during his courtesy visit to Anambra and Enugu states, where he met with delegates of the All Progressives Congress (APC). According to him, the effects of the government’s efforts will soon become evident. “Re-engineering of the security architecture, with the view to be more effective on the ground, we will begin to see the fruits of that, especially with the acquisition of more platforms – mobile platforms, air platforms, and, of course, technology, that will be useful in resolving some of these problems,” he said, according to a statement by Laolu Akande, his spokesman. Osinbajo also said more will be done to enhance security, adding that to improve the capacity of the Nigerian military, “technology would be useful and deployed to resolve the problem of insecurity”. He also told the delegates, that he believes that God made him the vice-president so he can later serve as the president. “As for my experience in government, after serving as vice-president and being exposed to several aspects of governance by President Muhammadu Buhari, I know that God made this possible so that I would serve the people as president,” he said. During the visit, Osinbajo also met with Chukwuma Soludo, governor of Anambra, and Ifeanyi Ugwuanyi, Enugu governor.
