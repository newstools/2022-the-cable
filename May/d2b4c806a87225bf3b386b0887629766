President Muhammadu Buhari says his administration’s investment in education is laying a solid foundation for younger generations in the country. According to a statement on Thursday by Femi Adesina, presidential spokesman, Buhari said this in his address to mark Children’s Day celebrated annually on May 27. Adesina said the president recognises the place of education in the development of every country and is therefore committed to seeing a further significant reduction in the number of out-of-school children. The president said his administration will continue to work hard to ensure that every child has access to education, which prepares them for a bright future. “He acknowledges that while education of the Nigerian child will remain on the front burner for this government, other issues – healthcare, protection from harm, drugs, cultism, child trafficking and abuse, domestic violence – are equally receiving needed attention from the government,” the statement reads. The spokesman added that Buhari believes that Nigerian children deserve a safe country where they can grow, and emerge as successful leaders in different fields of endeavour. “With our investments in infrastructure, youth development, education, Information and Communication Technology, Digital Economy, Culture, Arts and Entertainment in the last seven years, I believe we are laying a solid foundation for a better quality of life for future generations in the country,” Buhari was quoted as saying.
