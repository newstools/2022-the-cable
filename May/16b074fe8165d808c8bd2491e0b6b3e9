BY TERSOO ADAGHER One month into office, the Controller General of the Federal Fire Service, Jaji Olola Abdulganiyu MNSE, MIFire.E, COREN has matched his words with action as he is seeing to be assiduously working, not just to better position the Service for efficient and effective service delivery but through his actions, reassured Nigerians that safety of lives and property remains paramount on his agenda and in no distant time, his administration will reduce or prevent fire occurrences in the country. These were part of his words during his decoration as Controller General of the Service on April 28, 2022. He was appointed by President Muhammadu Buhari (GCFR) to take over the baton of leadership at the Federal Fire Service on April 22, 2022. Until his appointment, Abdulganiyu was the Deputy Controller General (DCG) in charge of administration and supplies in the Federal Fire Service. Since assumption of duty, his courage, strength, brilliance, dogged tenacity and vision which is already glaring in the eyes of the public is worth commending. Being mindful of the strategic vision of the Service which is geared towards achieving its mandate in the most effective manner, Abdulganiyu swung into action and rolled out immediate areas of interest when he assumed office. This includes; This he said was in recognition of the world of difference that his predecessor, Dr Lima Ibrahim, who he described as a mentor, leader and friend had put in during his time to move the Service forward which he also promised to tap from his resourcefulness and build on his legacies towards making the Service better than he met it. Similarly, while speaking recently on the need to boost the morale of officers for efficient response to fire incidents as the world marked the International Firefighters’ Day on May 4, 2022, Abdulganiyu called for empathy and goodwill for firefighters across the globe, saying rather than attack a firefighter at fire scenes, the public should rather learn to appreciate, support and celebrate them. In his words: “As we mark the International Firefighters’ Day, I call on all and sundry to join hands with the Federal Fire Service to ensure the safety of lives and property. For a fireman to risk his life, staying up round the clock attending to life-threatening situations without a commensurate reward system is not motivating. It does not only affect the efficiency but it destroys productivity”. “Straight from the field, we have had reports of exposures of our men to generic triggers of post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) as first responders to traumatic scenes. In some cases, they get away with serious respiratory challenges, and near-death explosions of gas cylinders just to mention a few. The degree to which our firemen are exposed to hazards on a daily basis each time they combat a fire or are out on a rescue operation is phenomenal. “Therefore a show of empathy and goodwill will go a long way to lift the spirits of these firefighters to continue in the line of sacrifice and love for the country, to save lives and property, especially on a day like this”, he said. Born on August 13, 1965, to the family of Alhaji Umar Olola Jaji in Ilorin, Kwara state, Abdulganiyu who is from a humble background but got determined from his childhood to pursue his dreams, started his educational career at Alore L.S.M.B School, Ilorin, Kwara state where he obtained his First School Leaving Certificate.
