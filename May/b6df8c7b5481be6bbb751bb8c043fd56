Kevin De Bruyne scored four goals as Manchester City won 5-1 at Wolverhampton Wanderers in their English Premier League (EPL) encounter on Wednesday night. The champions scored in both halves to claim vital points that maintained their three-point lead at the top of EPL and moved them closer to defending their title with two matches left to the end of the season. De Bruyne opened the scoring in seven minutes, slotting home a Bernardo Silva pass. He then restored the lead five minutes after Wolves equalized, finishing off the rebound from a saved shot. The Belgium international completed his hat-trick with a curling strike in 24 minutes before rounding off his goalscoring exploit on 60 minutes with a shot into the bottom corner. Raheem Sterling completed the rout as Man City moved to 89 points from 36 matches, two games away from clinching a sixth EPL title. In other matches of the night, Chelsea won 3-0 at ten-men Leeds United to cement the third place, thanks to goals from Mason Mount, Christian Pulisic, and the improving Romelu Lukaku. RESULTS
