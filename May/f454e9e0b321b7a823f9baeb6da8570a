Babagana Zulum, governor of Borno, has visited Kala-Balge LGA, where several residents were killed by insurgents recently. Insurgents said to be loyal to a Boko Haram faction attacked residents who were reportedly in a deserted village in the community, and killed over 30 persons. On Sunday, Zulum, who was accompanied by Dige Muhammed, majority leader of Borno house of assembly, and Zainab Gimba, a federal lawmaker, met with the community members. In his remarks, he advised residents to desist from going to deserted villages, especially to scavenge for metals. “The insurgents and their collaborators used to scavenge for metals and other abandoned household materials in deserted villages. These serve as raw materials for their fabrications. I urge you to desist from going to such places,” he said. Zulum also held a meeting with Mohammed Jibrin, the military’s commanding officer in Kala-Balge. As part of the visit, the governor inspected the public health facilities in the community, and promised to double the salaries of health workers willing to remain and work in the community. “Any health worker that is willing to work here, we will double his or her salary and we will, insha Allah, make sure that there is a routine shift to allow them to visit families,” he said. Zulum also gave a two-month deadline for the reopening of the completed hospital and schools, as well the completion of ongoing projects in Rann, the headquarters of the LGA.
