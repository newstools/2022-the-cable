Abdulmumin Jibrin, a former member of the house of representatives and director-general of the Tinubu support group council, has announced his decision to leave the All Progressives Congress (APC). TheCable understands that Jibrin decided to leave the party after another face-off with Abdullahi Ganduje, the governor of Kano state. Jibrin had wanted to contest for a seat in the house of reps on the party’s platform but was reportedly blocked by Ganduje with whom he had been having a running battle for five years. In a statement on his social media handles on Saturday, Jubrin said he will announce his new political party in the next 24 hours. “I have done my best for APC. It’s time to move on. I will announce my new political party within the next 24 hours insha Allah. I will make a formal statement in due course. Hon Abdulmumin Jibrin,” the politician tweeted. I have done my best for APC. Its time to move on. I will announce my new political party within the next 24 hours insha Allah. I will make a formal statement in due course. Hon Abdulmumin Jibrin — Abdulmumin Jibrin (@AbdulAbmJ) May 7, 2022  Jibrin was elected to the lower legislative chamber in 2011 and 2015. He fell out with the leadership and was suspended and removed from plum committees in 2016. He was re-elected in 2019 but was sacked by a court in what he believed had the signature of Ganduje. Afterwards, President Muhammadu Buhari appointed him as an executive director in the Federal Housing Authority (FHA). In February, a FHA disciplinary panel summoned him over alleged misconduct. “In furtherance of the above the governing board at its 3rd Regular meeting held on Tuesday 2nd February, 2022 had set up an investigative/Disciplinary Panel to investigate all the alleged serious misconducts leveled against you,” the panel had written him. Meanwhile, Jibrin’s announcement also comes hours after he shared photos of him campaigning for Tinubu in front of a crowd of supporters in Kano state.
