The home of Mahinda Rajapaksas, Sri Lanka prime minister, was on Monday, set on fire by a group of anti-government protesters. According to the BBC, this came hours after Rajapaksas resigned in response to calls for his ousting, owing to an economic crisis. The nation is facing its worst economic crisis since gaining independence from Britain in 1948. Since last month, there have been protests over rising prices and power cuts. Sri Lanka was placed under curfew after the violent clashes between Rajapaksa supporters and anti-government protesters in Colombo, Sri Lanka’s capital. The resignation move by Mahinda, which was made in an attempt to pacify the protesters, had failed as crowds raided his residence on Monday. He was, however, evacuated to safety. Police and riot squads were said to have been deployed, and tear gas and water cannon were fired. The protesters retaliated, attacking government supporters and targeting ruling party MPs. Seven people are said to have died and more than 190 injured since Monday. Mahinda’s house in Kurunegala was also reportedly set on fire by the protesters. More than 50 houses of politicians were said to have been burnt overnight. In the north-east, protesters reportedly gathered in front of Trincomalee Naval Base after reports that Mahinda Rajapaksa had gone there with family members upon escaping from his Colombo residence.
