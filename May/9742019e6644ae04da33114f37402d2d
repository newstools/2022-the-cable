Abdullahi Sule, governor of Nasarawa, has declared his intention to seek re-election in the 2023 general election. He announced his intention on Tuesday at an event held in Lafia, the Nasarawa capital. While receiving the nomination and expression of interest forms of the All Progressives Congress (APC), which was presented to him by support groups, Sule said his achievements are enough to secure victory for him in the 2023 general election. “Our work is enough to deter any opposition,” he said. Presenting the forms, Murtala Abubakar, senior special assistant (SSA) to the governor on sustainable development goals (SDGs), who represented the support groups, said the supporters decided to purchase the form for Sule in recognition of his efforts to develop the state and ensure continuity. Among those present at the declaration were Emmanuel Akabe, Nasarawa deputy governor; John Mamman, Nasarawa APC chairman, lawmakers from the state, as well as support groups.
