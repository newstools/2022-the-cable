Calvin Bassey, Super Eagles defender, has been named in the 2021/22 UEFA Europa Leagues team of the season. The ultimate team was announced via the UEFA’s Europa League’s Twitter account on Friday. Bassey was phenomenal for Ranger FC as the Scottish giants raced to the final of the Europa League, playing 14 games at the heart of the team’s defence. The 22-year-old was also the standout performer for Rangers in the final as they lost to Eintracht Frankfurt of Germany 5-4 on penalties — following a 1-1 scoreline and extra time. The 2021/22 Europa League team of the season was selected by UEFA’s technical observer panel. Bassey is placed on the left side of a three-man defence of the 3-4-3 formation.
