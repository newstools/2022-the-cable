Victor Mbaoma, Super Eagles forward, says the team is out for revenge against Mexico in their upcoming friendly game. Mbaoma, Enyimba’s prolific striker, spoke with TheCable on Saturday at the team’s Adolphus hotel in Dallas, Texas, ahead of the encounter which will be played at the AT & T Stadium in Arlington. The 25-year-old said the three-time African champions are out to redeem their bragging rights against the South American side when they file out at 1:08 am on Sunday morning Nigerian time. The last time Mexico played Nigeria was in a friendly in July 2021, which the home-based Super Eagles team lost 4-0 at the Memorial Coliseum in Los Angeles. “It is revenge time for what Mexico did against us in last year’s friendly game,” Mbaoma told TheCable. “The last year game was somehow for the team. We lost 4-1 and that really was bad. But this time around we are out to avenge the loss. “With the caliber of players we have in camp for this game? We are out to win against the El Tri of Mexico.” The 2022 FIFA World Cup bound Mexican side will be gunning for a seventh win in twelve games against Nigeria. The Super Eagles will after the clash with Mexico square it up against Ecuador on June 2 in New Jersey. It is the team’s first gathering and run-out since narrowly missing a ticket to the FIFA World finals in Qatar at the end of March.
