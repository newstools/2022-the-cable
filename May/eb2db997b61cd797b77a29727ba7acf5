Gunmen have killed Zakari Kigbu, a former federal commissioner of the National Population Commission (NPC). Kigbu was said to have been killed at his residence in Azuba community near Lafia, the Nasarawa capital, on Sunday. Ramhan Nansel, Nasarawa police public relations officer (PPRO), said the gunmen invaded the victim’s residence at about 12:30am and shot him, while two of his children were abducted. The police spokesman said upon receiving report of the incident, Adesina Soyemi, the commissioner of police, immediately deployed security personnel comprising operatives of the anti-kidnapping unit and police mobile force to the scene. Nansel added that the CP has also visited the scene for on-the-spot assessment. “The police will carry out a comprehensive investigation to unravel, arrest and prosecute those behind the dastardly act,” the police spokesman said. He also called on members of the public to avail the force with useful information that could lead to the rescue of the abducted victims and arrest of the perpetrators. The development comes amid attacks on residents of the state in recent months. Days before the latest incident, Muhammad Shehu-Baba, chairman of Keffi LGA in Nasarawa state, and Tanimu Mohammed, his aide, were abducted, while Alhassan Habib, a police orderly, was killed. Shehu-Baba and Mohammed have, however, regained their freedom.
