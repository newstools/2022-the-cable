Abbas Masanawa says he has resigned as the managing director of the Nigeria Security Printing and Minting Company (NSPMC). Last week, Masanawa obtained his expression of interest and nomination forms to contest the All Progressives Congress (APC) governorship ticket in Katsina. His resignation followed the directive by President Muhammadu Buhari asking appointees seeking elective offices to resign on or before May 16. The president’s directive is in line with section 84(12) of the Electoral Act 2022, which retricts political appointees from participating as delegates or aspirants at political party primaries. Speaking with journalists in Abuja on Monday, Masanawa said he has complied with the directive of the president. The governorship hopeful also said Godwin Emefiele, governor of Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN), has received his resignation letter. “Absolutely, I have abided completely with the presidential directive. And I’ve resigned my appointment as the managing director, and chief executive officer of Nigeria Security, Printing and Minting,” he said. “I sent in my resignation through the chairman of the board, who also happens to be the governor of the Central Bank of Nigeria. “The governor of the central bank is the chairman of the board of Nigeria security, printing and minting. I have surely done that.”
