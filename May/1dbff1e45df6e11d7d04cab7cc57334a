The Christian Association of Nigeria (CAN) has called on President Muhammadu Buhari to secure the release of Samuel Kanu, prelate of the Methodist Church Nigeria (MCN). He was said to have been kidnapped on Sunday along Enugu-Port Harcourt expressway in Umunneochi LGA of Abia state. Dennis Mark, the bishop of Owerri, as well as another cleric, were also said to have been abducted during the attack. In a statement signed by Adebayo Oladeji, special assistant to Samson Ayokunle, CAN president, the association condemned the abduction of the prelate and asked Buhari to give an express order to the security agencies to free him immediately. CAN also asked Buhari to put an end to the incessant abduction of clerics and other Nigerians. “If a great Servant of God of Uche’s calibre could be kidnapped like a three-year old baby on a major road without any resistance from the Police, it speaks volume of what our security architecture has become,” the statement reads. The association said no fewer than 10 clerics have been kidnapped in 2022  and none was rescued by the security agencies. It said: “In two instances, the victims were killed by their captors unfortunately!” “This is no more a country one can be proud. No reasonable government can continue to leave the citizens in a terrible state of insecurity as we are presently. This situation is not good for our nation at all. “We, once again, call on President Muhammadu Buhari to do all within his powers to get these servants of God released very soon and unhurt. “This administration must redeem its image of widespread insecurity by bringing sanity to this situation before leaving office. “To those who are holding these Servants of God, we appeal to them to let go of them because they are not responsible for whatever reasons that made them criminals. We call on Christians and other well meaning Nigerians to join us in praying for their release immediately.”
