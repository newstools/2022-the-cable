The Economic and Financial Crimes Commission (EFCC) says its operatives have arrested one Baron Nnamdi, identified as an outdoor advertisement executive, over political messages that appeared in two billboards in Enugu, bearing the logo of the commission. Wilson Uwujaren, EFCC spokesperson, said this in a statement issued on Sunday. Nnamdi, the alleged designer, printer and owner of the billboards, was arrested by the commission on Saturday. The anti-graft agency said two “super 48 sheet billboards” located at Otigba and Zik avenue junctions in Enugu bore “offensive” messages using the name of the EFCC to “threaten” some politicians in the state in the build-up to the 2023 general election. One of the messages reads: ‘2023: Enugu PDP Learn from 2007 Election… EFCC is Coming with Koboko on Corrupt Candidates’. Uwujaren said the suspect claimed that he was contracted by a media aide to a former deputy governor of the state, who is interested in contesting in the 2023 polls, to carry out the campaigns. According to the commission, Nnamdi also claimed he was paid N160,000 for the one-week campaign, and that the aide supplied him with the messages, EFCC logo and pictures of operatives used for the billboards. “Following his arrest, operatives of the commission visited the two sites and pulled down the offensive advertisements,” the statement reads. “Meanwhile, the commission warns politicians to play by the rule and refrain from dragging the EFCC into the political fray. “It reiterates that, apart from issues of economic and financial crimes which fall within its purview, the commission has no role in the political process and should not be distracted. “It stated further, that it will not hesitate to bring the full weight of the law to bear on errant politicians who continue to impersonate the commission and its operatives.”
