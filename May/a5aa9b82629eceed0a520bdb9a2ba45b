Bola Tinubu, a chieftain of the All Progressives Congress (APC) and presidential hopeful, on Monday, appeared before the party’s screening panel. The screening committee, chaired by John Oyegun, concluded the first phase of the exercise on Monday night. Twelve aspirants were screened on Monday, and the remaining 11 are scheduled for the exercise on Tuesday. After his screening, Oyegun and Tinubu posed for photographs. Tinubu and Oyegun have been at loggerheads in the past over various issues including accusations in 2018 over the former’s efforts at reconciling party members, as well as the circumstances around the 2020 governorship election in Edo state. According to a statement by Bayo Adenuga, spokesman of the Tinubu campaign organisation, when he appeared before the panel, the former Lagos governor highlighted his achievements and why he is fit to be president. “Tinubu impressed the panel during the screening process with the way and manner he answered and provided insight into many of the questions asked,” the statement reads. “Some of the questions bordered on his upbringing, educational and professional background. He confidently told the panel why he is qualified to fly the flag of APC as its presidential candidate. “He cited his success as governor of Lagos State, his raising the internal revenue generation of the state from a paltry N600M monthly, which has now grown to N51Billion today. “He also cited his invitation to Enron to begin the first state-backed power generation in Nigeria and how Nigeria will need to take the power transmission lines as a highway. “Tinubu in his answers demonstrated vast knowledge in economic management and perfect understanding of Nigeria’s political economy. “The screening committee expressed satisfaction with Tinubu’s knowledge of the economy and sociopolitical issues that are affecting the country.” See photos below. <img class="aligncenter wp-image-706035"
