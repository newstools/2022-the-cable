The Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) has dismissed the claim that Mahmood Yakubu, its chairman, may join the race for president. Owing to the report that Godwin Emefiele, governor of the Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN), is nursing a presidential bid and coupled with the growing list of presidential hopefuls, some Nigerians have insinuated that the INEC chairman may soon join the race. But reacting to this insinuation on Sunday, Rotimi Oyekanmi, spokesperson of the INEC chairman, said as a rule, Yakubu remains an umpire in the electoral process of the federation. He said the proposition is absurd, adding that the INEC chairman will not delve into matters at variance with the law, morals and principles. “Our attention has been drawn to innuendos in certain quarters that Nigerians should not be surprised if the INEC chairman joins the presidential race or urging him to do so. It is a preposterous proposition. It will not happen,” he said. “The chairman remains an umpire committed to free, fair and credible elections. “His constitutional responsibilities as the chief electoral commissioner the federation and returning officer for the presidential election are onerous for him to comtemplate straying into extraneous matters at variance with the law, morality and his personal principles. “The chairman will continue to discharge his duties without affection for, or illwill against, any political party or candidate.”
