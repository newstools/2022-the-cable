Sunday Dare, minister of youth and sports development, on Wednesday, congratulated the national U-20 team for qualifying for the final of the WAFU U-20 Championship in Niamey, Niger Republic. The Flying Eagles beat Cote d’Ivoire 2-1 after extra time on Tuesday evening in a tightly contested semi-final encounter to book a place in Saturday’s final as well as qualify for the CAF U-20 Africa Cup of Nations (AFCON) in Egypt in 2023. “Your hard-earned victory over Cote d’Ivoire in the semi-final and your performances in the earlier games against Ghana and Burkina Faso have shown what is possible when a team plays with focus, determination and discipline,” Dare said in a statement. “We are so proud of you all players and coaches, and also happy with the results so far. We are solidly behind you. However, this is not the time to rest on your oars. The journey ahead of you is a long one. “Go all out on Saturday, win the WAFU U-20 trophy, and then we will begin to prepare for the U-20 AFCON next year and be among the four African representatives at the World Cup proper.” The Flying Eagles, who had earlier beaten the defending champion Ghana 2-0 and drew 2-2 with Burkina Faso, will face the Benin Republic in Saturday’s final in Niamey.
