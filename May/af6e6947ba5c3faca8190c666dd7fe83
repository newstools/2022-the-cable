Abdulmuminin Usman, Emir of Katsina, says he supports the presidential bid of Vice-President Yemi Osinbajo. Usman said this when Osinbajo visited him at his palace in Katsina on Saturday. The traditional ruler said the vice-president has the capacity to govern the country. “Take it from me, we are behind you; we will try as much as possible; someone with experience is a better person than someone who is very new to the administration; so you are on board already,” NAN quoted him as saying. “You need some touches; the touches you need are consultations; we are the grassroots; you consult the traditional institution; you go with them. “I really pray with all my heart that you succeed; that you carry on where your predecessor stopped and Allah will help you “I know you are a quiet man; a pastor, you know God; you know how to go with Him; we will pray for you Insha Allah but in your mind take it; this is a work that must be done.” On his part, Osinbajo said his current position and having served as acting president have given him the experience to govern Nigeria. “I have put myself forward to run as President of the Federal Republic of Nigeria and to succeed by the Grace of God, our very able President, Muhammadu Buhari when on May 29, 2023, he leaves office for a new government,” he said. “I put myself forward for the reason that I have served under his tutelage for the past seven years and on some occasions, I have also acted as president. “During that period, the president has exposed me to all that there is to know about governing a complex and diverse country such as ours. “I want to say that I have learnt; there is considerable experience; and the key issues that concern our country today, issues of security, issues of the economy are issues that I believe we can do very well and I am in a position to do quite a lot on.”
