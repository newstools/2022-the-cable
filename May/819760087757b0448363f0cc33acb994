Nasir el-Rufai, governor of Kaduna, says Bola Tinubu, presidential hopeful on the platform of the All Progressives Congress (APC), will get the support of Kaduna during the party’s primary. El-Rufai said this on Thursday after APC delegates expressed their intention to support the presidential ambition of Tinubu. The Kaduna governor had earlier said he would rally round any candidate supported by the delegates, and thanked Tinubu for visiting Kaduna, and for remembering the state during its trying moments. “You are the first presidential aspirant to come to Kaduna. You are not taking us for granted. We will not forget that,” el-Rufai said. “You have spoken to our people. They appear convinced, and when the people of Kaduna give their word, sir, you can rest assured of our support. “We keep to our words and ensure that as we intend to keep our promise. We will also want you to promise to deal with insecurity, infrastructure and support agriculture and empowerment.” Earlier in his remarks, Tinubu said if elected, his leadership will bring an end to banditry and killings. “Governance is not about your physical strength. It is not about wrestling; it is about thinking, We are going to use the brain to bring development and innovations to Nigeria,” Tinubu said. “I am the best of all of them. In terms of experience, private sector, governance, we joined hands together to form APC, We have never failed, and we will not fail. Our broom will sweep them away. I know the road; follow the man who knows the road.” “The textile industry will be back, farmers will be safe and food security will be enhanced.”
