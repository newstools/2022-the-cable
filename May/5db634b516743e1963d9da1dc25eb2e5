Anthony Albanese has been sworn in as Australia’s 31st prime minister. He was sworn in by David Hurley, Australia’s governor-general, at the government house in Canberra on Monday. Albanese, the Labour party leader, had defeated Scott Morrison and his coalition in the federal election held on Saturday, ending the coalition’s hold on power for nearly nine years. Albanese was sworn into power along with his deputy leader Richard Marles, and three senior members of the new Labour cabinet. Marles was sworn in as the minister for employment and deputy prime minister, Penny Wong as the minister for foreign affairs, Jim Chalmers as the treasurer and Katy Gallagher as the minister for finance and attorney-general. The ceremony was fast-tracked as the prime minister is expected to fly out to Japan on Monday to take part in a meeting of the Quad security partnership in Tokyo, Japan. Speaking to the press in Canberra, Albanese said his party will meet on Tuesday next week to finalise the composition of his cabinet, which would then be sworn in on Wednesday. Marles will serve as the acting prime minister until Albanese’s return.
