A two-storey building collapsed on Chris Igadi Street in Ago Palace Way area of Lagos state on Saturday. There was no casualty from the building collapse which happened around 3 am. Operatives of the Lagos State Fire and Rescue Service, the Lagos State Ambulance Service (LASAMBUS), and the Lagos State Building Control Agency (LASBCA) were deployed in the scene shortly after the incident. Speaking on the incident, Olufemi Oke-Osanyintolu, permanent secretary of Lagos State Emergency Management Agency (LASEMA) confirmed that no casualty was recorded from the incident. He said the house had given signs of caving in, which helped the occupants to evacuate the building early. Osanyintolu said the site of the collapsed structure had been handed over to the Lagos State Building Control Agency (LASBCA). “The agency responded to the collapsed two-story building on Chris Igadi Street, off Ago Palace Way, opposite Kilimanjaro/ AP filling station, around 3am this morning,” he said. “On arrival, information gathered from the residents revealed that the building gave signs several hours before it collapsed. Fortunately, nobody was trapped as all the occupants evacuated the area when the signs began two hours before the collapse. “A headcount of occupants was carried out to ensure no occupants are missing and the remains of the building were cordoned off. The operation was concluded around 5:23 am. The site will be handed over to LABSCA and the Ministry of Physical Planning for further investigation.” This incident comes about a week after more than 20 persons died in the collapse of a three-story building at Ibadan street in Ebute Metta area.
