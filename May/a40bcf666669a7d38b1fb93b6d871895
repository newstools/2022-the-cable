On Saturday, Jibrin, a former house of representatives member, said he was going to announce his new political party soon, adding that he has done his best for the APC. TheCable understands that Jibrin decided to leave the party after a face-off with Abdullahi Ganduje, the governor of Kano. Jibrin had wanted to contest for a seat in the house of representatives on the party’s platform, but was reportedly blocked by Ganduje with whom he had been having a running battle for five years. Earlier on Sunday, Abdullahi Abbas, Kano APC chairman, said Ganduje has commenced efforts to stop the defection of Jibrin from the party. He said Ganduje has asked that the crisis among those seeking to represent Kiru/Bebeji federal constituency be resolved.
