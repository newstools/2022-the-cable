Mohammed Hayatu-Deen, a former managing director of the now-defunct FSB International Bank, says Nigeria needs a president who understands how to run a thriving economy. Hayatu-Deen, a presidential hopeful on the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) platform, spoke on Sunday at a media parley in Lagos. He said Nigeria has been governed by politicians who do not understand the economy which is why “people do not have basic access to the basic needs of life”. “Nigeria needs people who understand what the microeconomic conditions of the country are,” he said. “This is not the time for politics, this is the time for getting people who know what it takes, who understands what makes an economy successful. These are unique times in our history that requires very unique and different kind of managers to fix the country.” According to the economist, “it is a miracle that Nigeria is still standing” despite the several indicators showing that the country’s economy is struggling. While calling on the media to enhance its social responsibility, Hayatu-Deen said the country must be well structured to work optimally. “As we approach these dying hours or days, you have a major responsibility to sensitise the Nigerian people, most especially the delegates in both parties to bring into their own sensibilities to ensure they pick the right candidates,” he said. “You have to do this for us and ensure that Nigeria is rescued. “My aim is to help my nation. No one would accuse me of being a bystander and didn’t join in trying to salvage the nation when it was burning.”
