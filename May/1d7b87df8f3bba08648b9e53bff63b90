To continue to build our nation, we need to invest in developing leadership skills especially amongst young people. With nearly 50% percent of the Nigeria population being talented youth, we believe it’s very important. We launched the Lateef Jakande Leadership Academy, to develop future leaders by equipping them with the pre-requisite skills that would assist them in transitioning into the public sector. Leadership is crucial at all levels within the society.  Our goal is to provide a platform that will provide invaluable exposure, purposeful leadership preparation that will positively impact our youth to cultivate a shared vision that will lead to active citizenship and nation building. At Lagos State, we are building leaders today for a greater tomorrow!” The Fellowship aims to identify the brightest young professionals, at various stages of their career, with a profound sense of purpose.
