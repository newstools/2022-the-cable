Peter Obi, presidential hopeful of the Labour party, has appealed to his supporters to desist from attacking his opponents and embrace the “spirit of sportsmanship”. Since he resigned his membership of the Peoples Democratic Pary (PDP), netizens, who shared his vision to lead Nigeria, have been fiercely criticising other hopefuls. But in a Twitter thread on Sunday, Obi said elections are a democractic contest, and as such, there will always be need for adversaries. He advised his supporters to desist from bickering and vilification and promote behaviour worthy of an ideal democratic contest. “It has been brought to my attention, and I have also observed that some of my numerous supporters are making personal attacks on other aspirants/candidates,” he said. “Whilst thanking you for your support, which I sincerely value and appreciate, I humbly appeal that we all imbibe the spirit of sportsmanship and avoid name-calling or personal attacks on other aspirants and candidates. “The common goal is to make Nigeria better. Elections are a democratic contest and need not be adversarial.” On Friday, Obi said he is not desperate to become Nigeria’s president, but that he is only desperate to see Nigeria work, especially for the youth of the country. The former governor of Anambra resigned his membership of the PDP, the leading opposition party, citing “recent developments” in the party as a reason.
