The All Progressives Congress (APC) has extended the sale of its expression of interest and nomination forms to May 10. The information was contained in a revised schedule of activities released by Suleiman Arugungu, APC national organising secretary, on Wednesday. Following the extension of the sale of forms, there are speculations that more northerners may join the race for the presidency in the 2023 polls. The party has also fixed between May 12 and 14 for congresses to pick delegates who will vote at the state and national level. Argungu said the last day for the submission of completed forms and accompanying documents is now May 11. “Congresses to elect Local Government Area (LGA), State and National Delegates will now be held from Thursday, 12th May to Saturday, 14th May, 2022,” the statement reads. The party’s nomination and expression of interest forms for presidential aspirants cost N100 million, while governorship hopefuls will pay N50 million. The price of forms for persons seeking to contest for seats in state houses of assembly is pegged at N2 million, while that of the house of representatives is N10 million and the senate is N20 million. The primaries for governorship, state houses of assembly, house of representatives, and senate are May 18, 20, 22 and 24, respectively.
