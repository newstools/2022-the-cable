Nasir el-Rufai, governor of Kaduna, has approved the appointment of Umma Ahmed as commissioner for local government. Prior to her appointment, Umma was the administrator of Birnin Gwari local government. Muyiwa Adekeye, special adviser to the governor on media and publicity in a statement, announced the development in a statement issued on Thursday. According to Adekeye, Umma was nominated to replace Shehu Muhammad, who “resigned to pursue political aspiration”. “Hajiya Umma was the Director-General of the Kaduna State Quality Assurance Authority before her posting to Birnin-Gwari,” the statement reads. Aside from the commissioner, Abdullahi Ibrahim, the special adviser on political matters, has been appointed as the new administrator of Birnin Gwari local government. Also, Aminu Shagali, former speaker of the Kaduna house of assembly, will take over from Ibrahim as the special adviser on political matters. Murtala Dabo, chairman of the Kaduna state fiscal responsibility commission, was also appointed as the new special adviser on economic matters. According to Adekeye, Dabo is a former banker, “who has served in several roles in the government since 2015”. Adekeye added that Dabo “will be succeeded in his role by Mohammed Jalal, currently a permanent commissioner in the Fiscal Responsibility Commission”. Also, Francis Kozah has been moved from the assembly service commission to become secretary of the Kaduna State Enterprise Development Agency (KADEDA), while Jibrin Sanusi is the new secretary of the assembly service commission.
