Kayode Fayemi, Ekiti governor and presidential hopeful, says if elected president, he will build on the legacy of President Muhammadu Buhari. Speaking when he visited Babagana Zulum, Borno governor, and All Progressives Congress (APC) members in the state on Thursday, Fayemi said security will be the top of his agenda. “We will build on the legacies of President Muhammadu Buhari and urgently address the identified gaps,” Femi Ige, spokesman of his campaign organisation, quoted him as saying. “Security will top my agenda as a security expert. I have a Ph.D in War studies and I consulted for Nigeria under President Olusegun Obasanjo, I was deeply involved in the resolution of the wars in Sierra Leone, Liberia, Rwanda and Sri Lanka. “We have a template that we’ll use in bringing peace to our people, so that we can farm in peace, school in peace and live in peace. If I can do it outside, why not for the country that has given me everything?” In Yobe, Fayemi told Yobe delegates that he is focused on ensuring that there is peace in the country. “My focus would be on bringing peace to my fatherland and ensuring that the Ibadan man finds home in Sokoto and the Sokoto man finds home in Akure, Abakaliki, Onisha or Owerri,” he said. “The Oweri man must find a home in Damaturu. This is the Nigeria I want to fight for and I’m confident it’s achievable.” On his part, Idi Barde Gubana, deputy governor of Yobe, said the APC in the state will support Fayemi’s presidential bid. “This state is for you,” Gubana said “You are the first to come and as you have remarked, it will be first come first served.”
