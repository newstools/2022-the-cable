Mike Okiro, former inspector-general of police, has narrated how some politicians convinced him to contest for a senatorial seat in Abuja — and collected all his savings. Okiro was an inspector-general of police between 2007 and 2009. He retired from the police force on July 24, 2009, after he clocked 60 years old. In 2010, the former IGP declared his intention to vie for the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) ticket for the federal capital territory (FCT) senatorial seat. But the former IGP was not successful in his bid to secure the ticket. Okiro spoke about his experience on Thursday during a programme organised by New Nigeria Dream Initiative in Abuja. He blamed both politicians and the citizens for the current problems in the country, particularly noting the issue of vote-buying. He asked Nigerians to vote for politicians who will deliver dividends of democracy in 2023, stressing that “enough is enough” of bad governance. “Sometimes, the politicians are at fault but we have more faults than the politicians. I have an experience. But I corrected myself when I said bye-bye to bad things. “I contested election in Abuja here for senate. I was on my own when they called me to come and contest. I said I have just retired, they said no, come and contest. I said okay, I will discuss it with my wife. “So, they would come to me and say we want to go here, bring money, we want to do this, bring money, we want to do that, bring money. I gave all my savings and nothing again to give. “It got to a point they came one day and I said I have nothing to give. They told me the former man was not doing very well and that I should come and salvage the people. The former police boss said such practices encourage corruption while asking the electorate and politicians to “say no to election vote-selling”.
