The Flying Eagles of Nigeria have defeated Cote D’Ivoire 2-1 in the semi-final of the ongoing WAFU B U20 championship in Niamey. The Ladan Bosso boys sailed through to the final of the competition after an explosive encounter with the Ivorian side at the Stade General Seyni Kountché on Tuesday night. Daniel Daga got Nigeria ahead with a header just five minutes into the game. But a few minutes to the half hour mark, the Ivorians equalised from an intelligently taken free kick at the edge of Nigeria’s eighteen-yard box. The 7-time African champions were on rampage in the Ivorians danger area. It, however, proved abortive as the match ended 1-1 at the end of regulation time. During extra time, forward Ibrahim Yahaya got the winner for Nigeria in the 111th minute when he tucked in from the penalty spot to make it 2-1. With the final berth, the Flying Eagles have booked the ticket to next year’s Africa U20 Cup of Nations taking place in Egypt. The Nigerian team will take on Benin Republic in the final on Saturday.
