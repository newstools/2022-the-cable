The All Progressives Congress (APC) has adjusted its schedule of activities for the 2023 general election. In a statement on Wednesday, Felix Morka, APC spokesman, said the special convention to pick the party’s presidential candidate would now hold from May 29 to 30. The ruling party had earlier fixed the exercise to hold between May 30 and June 1. Morka also said the party’s primaries to select candidates for governorship and house of representatives has been fixed for May 26 — the exercise was earlier scheduled for May 20 and May 24, respectively. Also, primaries for senate and state houses of assembly would be held on May 27 — instead of the earlier dates of May 25 and May 22. “The National Working Committee (NWC) of the All Progressives Congress (APC), on Wednesday, 18th of May, 2022, approved an adjusted Timetable/Schedule of Activities for the Governorship, State House of Assembly, House of Representatives, Senate and Presidential Primaries and Appeals as follows; [primary election for] governorship and house of representatives – Thursday, 26th of May, 2022,” the statement reads. “Senate and house of assembly – Friday, 27th of May, 2022. “Special convention for presidential primaries, Sunday 29 – Monday, 30th of May, 2022.” Morka added that election appeals for governorship and house of representatives would be held on May 27, while May 30 has been fixed for appeals on senate and house of assembly matters.
