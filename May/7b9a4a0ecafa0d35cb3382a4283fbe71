Former Vice-President Atiku Abubakar has won the presidential ticket of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP). To clinch the ticket to represent the party in the 2023 elections, he floored Bukola Saraki, former senate president; Emmanuel Udom, Akwa Ibom governor; Nyesom Wike, Rivers governor; Ayo Fayose, former governor of Ekiti; Bala Mohammed, Bauchi governor, among others. Atiku polled 371 votes to emerge the winner, while Wike, his closest challenger, secured 237 votes. Saraki placed third with 70 votes, followed by Udom Emmanuel (38), and Bala Mohammed (20). The special national convention of the opposition party took place in the velodrome of the MKO Abiola Stadium, Abuja. Prior to the commencement of voting, Aminu Tambuwal, Sokoto governor, withdrew from the contest. The Sokoto governor had asked his supporters to support the candidacy of Atiku. In a post on his social media handles after the result was announced on Saturday, Atiku said his focus will be on rebuilding and uniting the country. “Today, the march to rebuild and unite our great country moves forward. I am honoured to be named the presidential candidate of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP),” he wrote. “I look forward to speaking with Nigerians across the country, taking the message of hope and unity as we build one future for one people.”
