Victims Support Fund (VSF), a non-governmental humanitarian organisation, has donated relief materials to Kogi. The organisation owned by Theophilus Danjuma, former minister of defence, made the donations on Friday. VSF presented food items, commissioned solar-powered boreholes and donated medical items to health care centres across the state.  <img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-698974" src="https://f5p3e9e4.stackpathcdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/VSF3.jpeg" alt="" width="1024" height="683" srcset="https://f5p3e9e4.stackpathcdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/VSF3.jpeg 1024w, https://f5p3e9e4.stackpathcdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/VSF3-300x200.jpeg 300w, https://f5p3e9e4.stackpathcdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/VSF3-768x512.jpeg 768w, https://f5p3e9e4.stackpathcdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/VSF3-24x16.jpeg 24w, https://f5p3e9e4.stackpathcdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/VSF3-36x24.jpeg 36w, https://f5p3e9e4.stackpathcdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/VSF3-48x32.jpeg 48w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /> Toyosi-Akerele Ogunsuji, chairperson of the VSF task force, said the gesture was aimed at touching the lives of the rural poor. “We understand there are no internally displaced persons (IDPs) in Kogi state, but because of our dedication and commitment, we are today in Kogi state having initiated projects which will help to touch lives of the rural poor in Kogi,” she said. <img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-698976" src="https://f5p3e9e4.stackpathcdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/VSF1.jpeg" alt="" width="1024" height="683" srcset="https://f5p3e9e4.stackpathcdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/VSF1.jpeg 1024w, https://f5p3e9e4.stackpathcdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/VSF1-300x200.jpeg 300w, https://f5p3e9e4.stackpathcdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/VSF1-768x512.jpeg 768w, https://f5p3e9e4.stackpathcdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/VSF1-24x16.jpeg 24w, https://f5p3e9e4.stackpathcdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/VSF1-36x24.jpeg 36w, https://f5p3e9e4.stackpathcdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/VSF1-48x32.jpeg 48w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /> Edward Onoja, Kogi deputy governor, said the relief materials would go a long way in providing succour and hope to the people of the state.
