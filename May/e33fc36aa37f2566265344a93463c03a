The federal government has directed relevant authorities to ensure necessary tests are carried out on Nigerian athletes before they depart for the 2022 Commonwealth Games. The event is scheduled to hold between July 28 and August 8 in Birmingham, United Kingdom. Sunday Dare, minister of youths and sports development, gave the directive on Tuesday during a meeting with stakeholders of the 2022 Commonwealth Games (CWG) in Abuja. According to Dare, Nigeria will not hesitate to drop any athlete who attempts to tarnish the image of the country at the quadrennial event. Dare said the ministry would work with the Nigerian Olympic Committee (NOC) to ensure that the accommodation, camping, testing, ticketing and kits for the contingent are sorted in good time. On his part, Ismaila Abubakar, permanent secretary at the ministry, said nine federations had been listed to represent Nigeria at the games, comprising 100 athletes in judo, athletics, boxing, weightlifting, table tennis, wrestling, para-table tennis, para-athletics and para-powerlifting. Habu Gumel, president of the Nigerian Olympic Committee (NOC), also said 14 media houses and 701 journalists have applied to cover the games. Simon Ebhojaiye, director of Federation Elite and Athletes Department, (FEAD) and Nigeria’s Chef de Mission to the games, said the official phase of camping would commence from May 30 to July 2. Ebhojaiye added that the Birmingham Games Village would be officially opened on July 22 ahead of the opening ceremony on July 28.
