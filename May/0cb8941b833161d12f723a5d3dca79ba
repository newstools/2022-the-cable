Bisi Kolawole, the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) candidate in the Ekiti gubernatorial election, says there is nothing wrong with godfatherism. Prior to the party primaries, Kolawole was endorsed by Ayo Fayose, former governor of Ekiti, who described him as the “bridge-builder who will usher in a better future in the state”. Following the endorsement, Kolawole edged out Segun Oni, a former governor of the state, at the primaries to clinch the party’s ticket. Speaking in a debate organised by BBC on Thursday, Kolawole said although he has the qualifications that make him a strong contender, he doesn’t see anything wrong in having the support of a godfather. He said it would be unrealistic to think the governorship election can be won without support, adding that such a task cannot be done alone. Kolawole said regardless of the support from a godfather, he has the unique experience in politics and governance that other candidates cannot match. “I don’t see anything wrong in having a godfather. Nobody in life can do without having a backer,” he said. “Only those who are deceiving themselves, a tree cannot make a forest. If you have someone who is ready to support you, there is nothing wrong with it. “But the crux is on the person that is to be supported, is he or she strong? There is no one in Ekiti state that has the amount of experience that I have. “No Ekiti governor has ever been a supervisor, state lawmaker, commissioner and party chairman. In this case, whoever supports me as a godfather knows that I’m capable and strong enough.” On his agenda for the state, Kolawole said his plan is to reshape all critical aspects including economy, education, industrialisation, and particularly security. He said if elected the governor, the state will place attention on securing farmlands and farmers, which will result in productive farming and hasten industrialisation of agriculture.
