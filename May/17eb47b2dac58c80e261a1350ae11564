Nigerian Railway Corporation (NRC) says it has suspended the resumption of train services on the Abuja-Kaduna route. In March, the government suspended operations on the route after an attack on the train by gunmen. Eight passengers died in the attack, while many were kidnapped. The train service was scheduled to resume on Monday, May 23, 2022, but the families of the kidnapped Abuja-Kaduna train passengers kicked against the resumption. In a statement on Friday, Yakubu Mahmood, spokesperson of NRC, said a new date would be announced soon. “Sequel to our earlier Press Release No. 10 dated 16th May 2022 on the above caption, the General Public is kindly invited to note the Nigerian Railway Corporation (NRC) is announcing a shift in the resumption date for Abuja Kaduna,” the statement reads. While apologising for the delay in the resumption of train services, Mahmood assured the distraught families that it was working hard to secure the victims’ release. “The NRC will continue to cooperate and collaborate with the Federal Government in its uncompromising mandate of protecting the territorial integrity and the internal security of Nigeria for safeguarding the lives and properties of its citizens especially as it concerns the rail sub-sector,” the statement adds. “In the same vein, we once again identify with the relatives of those in captivity on the account of the recent attack on AKTS to rest assured that the Federal Government is alive to its responsibility for the safe rescue of all persons being held hostage. “We, therefore, appeal, particularly to the relatives of persons held hostage to be patient and cooperate with the Corporation and the Security Agencies as the Federal Government is exploring all possible ways and means to ensure the safe release of their loved ones from captivity, soonest. “The NRC expresses its profound gratitude to the security agencies for the continued support.”
