Adams Oshiomhole, former governor of Edo state, has been screened for a ticket to contest the senatorial election on the platform of the All Progressives Congress (APC). In what appears to be a u-turn from his presidential ambition, Oshiomhole presented himself for the screening on Saturday in Abuja. On April 4, Oshiomhole, during an event to mark his 70th birthday in Edo, said he was seeking to represent Edo north in the upper legislative chamber. “As I have spoken for Nigeria as the president of the NLC before — as a non-state actor — I believe that as a senator and with your support, your interest cannot be ignored in the red chamber in Abuja. With you supporting the project [for me] to be the senator, I will be the senator representing Edo north,” Oshiomhole had said. Francis Alimikhena is the current senator representing the constituency on the platform of the APC. There are reports that Alimikhena is also seeking a return to the senate. A few days ago, Oshiomhole also declared his intention to contest the 2023 presidential election on the platform of the APC. “I have come here this afternoon for one purpose to formally declare that I, Adams Oshiomhole, hereby declare with confidence my desire to contest for the office of the president of the Federal Republic of Nigeria on the platform of a party that we co-founded — All Progressives Congress (APC),” he had said. TheCable cannot independently verify if Oshiomhole bought the N100 million APC presidential form. The name of the former governor was not listed among APC presidential aspirants who have submitted their forms, according to a report by THISDAY.
