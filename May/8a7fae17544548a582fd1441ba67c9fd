A cleric of the Church of Nigeria (Anglican Communion) and his son have been abducted by gunmen along the Ifon-Okeluse road in Ose LGA of Ondo state. Funmilayo Odunlami, police spokesman in Ondo, confirmed the incident on Sunday, and said efforts are being made to rescue the victims. “It is true that the cleric and his son were kidnapped by unknown gunmen, but efforts are ongoing by detectives to rescue the victims,” Odunlami said. According to NAN, a resident earlier told journalists that the victims were travelling when they were abducted on Saturday. The resident said the abductors later contacted the family members of the victims and demanded the sum of N10 million as ransom. “The kidnappers contacted the family and demanded a ransom of N10 million, but the family raised N1 million, which the kidnappers rejected,” the resident was quoted as saying. The development comes months after two people were reportedly killed when gunmen attacked Okeluse community in Ose LGA of Ondo state. Aborowa Oladimeji, the manager of a petrol station in the area, was reportedly killed in the attack. A staff member of the filling station was also said to have been killed during the incident. Meanwhile, days before the Okeluse incident, at least three persons were killed and several houses razed following an attack on a community in Ifon, Ose LGA, Ondo state.
