President Muhammadu Buhari says it is the duty of security agencies to know terrorists’ hideouts. Buhari said this on Monday while responding to questions from journalists after he joined other Muslims to observe the Eid-el-Fitr prayers at the Mambilla barracks parade ground in Abuja. Speaking on insecurity, the president said his administration would continue to work to make Nigeria secure for citizens. He also charged the heads of security agencies in the country to rise up to their responsibilities, and go after the terrorists troubling the nation. “We’ll continue to make the environment secure, especially when the rainy season is coming, so that farmers can go back to their farms and we wouldn’t have problem of food security,” he said. “Heads of the services — army, navy, air force, the inspector-general of police and so on — are very much aware of the situation. It’s their duties to know where the terrorists are and eliminate them.” On the 2023 general election, the president said his administration remains committed to ensuring a free, fair and transparent process. When asked who he would like to hand over power to, Buhari said: “the person that Nigerians elect”. In his message during the Eid service, Dahiru Shua Mohammed, the acting chief imam of Mambilla barracks, spoke on the need for Muslims to embrace genuine repentance from sin, as well as promote love for one another, forgiveness, and tolerance. Special prayers were offered for an end to the challenges bedeviling the country, peaceful 2023 elections, as well as sustainable national unity, stability and prosperity.
