The Indigenous People of Biafra (IPOB) has asked William Kumuyi, the general superintendent of the Deeper Christian Life Ministry, to halt his planned crusade in Aba, Abia state. The crusade, titled ‘Jesus Power for Extraordinary Breakthrough’, is scheduled to take place in the commercial city between May 24 and 29. In a statement issued on Thursday, Emma Powerful, IPOB spokesperson, said the crusade should be suspended due to the insecurity in the region. According to Powerful, gunmen could disrupt the crusade and the blame pushed to IPOB. “We wish to advise Pastor Kumuyi of Deeper life Ministry to take note of the security situation in the South East as he comes to Aba for his gospel crusade. Let him and the organisers of the crusade make sure that nothing happens. The security of this region is not good because of political and criminal activities, therefore, we advise him to stop this crusade for security reasons,” the statement reads. “IPOB will not allow anyone to die because of this crusade scheduled to hold in Aba. The operation of criminals operating as unknown gunmen infiltrating the events is high and they will blame it on IPOB. “We ask him to pray for an end to the insecurity in Biafra land if he can. We charge Christians and men of God in Biafra land to engage God in fervent prayers to expose all those behind the insecurity in our land.” The proscribed separatist group asked Kumuyi to instead pray against “wicked leaders and saboteurs in Biafra land and Nigeria”. “They are the real problems of the people. Let him use the opportunity to pray against the powers holding people captive in Nigeria in his church in Lagos,” IPOB added.
