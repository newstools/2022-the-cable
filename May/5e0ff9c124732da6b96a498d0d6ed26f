Victor Osimhen, Super Eagles striker, has been named the best under 23 player in Serie A for the 2021/22 season. The Nigerian, who was 22-year-old when the season began, was announced as the gong winner in a tweet on the league’s verified Twitter handle on Friday. Osimhen beat the likes of Dusan Vlahovic of Juventus and Sassuolo’s Gianluca Scamacca to the award. Described as “a young striker with the experience of a veteran,” Osimhen has scored 14 league goals in 23 starts for Napoli as they slightly missed out on the season’s title. They occupy the third position on the Serie A log. He is the club leading goal scorer despite missing two months due to a facial injury. Goals, goals, goals.

His performance for the Parthenopeans this season has been a stark contrast to his previous one when reoccurring injuries hindered his justification of the club’s €70 million transfer fee. Osimhen began his senior career with VfL Wolfsburg in 2017 after impressing at the 2015 FIFA U-17 World Cup in Chile. He joined Lille in 2019. After just one season, he moved to Naples in 2020.
