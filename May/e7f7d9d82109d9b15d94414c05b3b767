Bello Hayatu Gwarzo, former senator representing Kano north, has been elected as the north-west vice-chairman of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP). Attah Aidoko Alli, chairman of the electoral committee, announced the results of the election on Tuesday night. He said Gwarzo got 426 votes to defeat his challenger Mohammed Yusuf, who garnered 313 votes. Alli said other positions including secretary, treasurer, organising secretary, and women leader, were elected through consensus. The congress was postponed after thugs disrupted the exercise held in April 2021 in Kano. The PDP zonal congress was marred by violence after the supporters of Rabiu Kwankwaso, former governor of Kano, clashed with those loyal to Aminu Tambuwal, Sokoto state governor. At the time, H. A. Tsanyawa, a factional PDP secretary in the Kano, had accused Kwankwaso of allegedly leading thugs to disrupt the congress. Following the crisis, Tsanyawa announced the suspension of Kwankwaso from the party but Kola Ologbondiyan, the then PDP national spokesman, dismissed the suspension which he described as a “mere fabrication”.
