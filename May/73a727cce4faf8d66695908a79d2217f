Omoyele Sowore, an activist, has announced the death of Comfort Olawoye, his grandmother. Announcing her death, Sowore said his grandmother died in the early hours of Wednesday at the age of 100. The activist said his grandmother had recently started to show signs that she will be departing the world soon, as she kept asking to speak with him. He added that he had visited his grandmother for the last time on May 5 during a campaign stop in his hometown. “At a point she desperately sought to have a video chat with me, so on April 17 2022  we had a chat where she stated that we needed to see me in person. I honoured her request by visiting her on May 5 2022 during a campaign stop in my home state and hometown.  As she typically talks about life she told me that every friend, mate and acquaintances she grew up with had already left this world. She talked about all the trees and animals she knew and buildings that had collapsed,” he said. “She said she needed to embark on a journey but was just waiting to see me before that very important trip, but because my grandma was often talking about “departing this world” at least for the last 20 years, I told her she’s not gonna die yet, at least not until I bring her with me to Abuja as President of Nigeria, I teased. It turned out this would be our final meeting.” Describing her as a “beautiful person inside and on the outside”, Sowore also said his grandmother lost her husband 50 years ago but opted to support her kids on her own and not remarry. “She grew and cooked her own food until maybe 7 yrs ago. She ate little, she never drank or partied. She was born and made for heaven,” he said. “She never attended school to be best of our knowledge but what she missed by not going to school she showed in her creative abilities, apart from fishing, she was a trader and engaged in fashion by making her own clothes and those of her kids and grandkids. “She is in a better place now. Will miss her immensely. Rest in Power, Mama!”
