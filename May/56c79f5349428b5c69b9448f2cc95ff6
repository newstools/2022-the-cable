Muhammad Sani Abdullahi, better known as Dattijo, says Nasir el-Rufai, governor of the state, has asked governorship hopefuls of the All Progressives Congress (APC) to support Uba Sani. Dattijo had, in March, announced his intention to contest the governorship of the state. Following the announcement, Dattijo, who was the Kaduna commissioner for budget and planning, was asked to resign before March 31, in line with the provisions of the Electoral Act 2022. In a statement addressed to his supporters on Thursday, Dattijo said the decision for governorship hopefuls to support Sani, who is the current senator representing Kaduna central, was discussed at a meeting held on Wednesday. “At a meeting on Wednesday, the governor directed that we rally round Senator Uba Sani for the Governorship seat. He has asked that I pick up the form for the senatorial seat for Kaduna Central,” the statement reads. “While this outcome is not what we have planned or hoped for, we have accepted it as Allah SWT’s will who provides to whom he wishes, when he wishes. “Therefore, we have entrusted our future to Him and prayed the State and the Nation will have the best of leaders in 2023. “I remain grateful for Mallam’s mentorship and for your unwavering support, which I do not take for granted. I had earlier purchased the APC governorship form but will be picking up the senate form as directed, insha Allah. “I hope we can continue to work together for the success of the APC in all elections. Your support is not taken for granted and will always be remembered and appreciated.”
