Zaynab Ikaz-Kassim has announced her intention to represent Etsako constituency in the house of representatives. Ikaz-Kassim announced her decision to contest in the 2023 elections on Monday in Benin city, Edo state. She said if elected, she will ensure quality representation for the constituency. “This decision was borne out of my desire to be the voice of my people and to represent them at the national assembly,” she said. “Over the past years, my people have been poorly represented and i believe i have the capacity to swing the odds in their favour and ensure that the dividends of democracy, which have been flying over our heads since 1999, will indeed reach our people. “It is heartwarming to see people of high caliber having shown interest to participate in this political season, I wish us all a good run. “Interestingly, it is common consensus that Auchi should produce the next member of the house of representatives and as an inbred daughter of Auchi, with the strength of character, youthful energy, and gender-focused go-getting spirit, I believe I am the best candidate, who can easily garner the support of women and youths. “I have lived a life of service to people nationwide and I believe now is the time for me to give back to my people. I am happy that I have taken this bold step after all these years of people asking me to go into full time politics.”
