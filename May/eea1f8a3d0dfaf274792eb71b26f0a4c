Deborah Samuel, a student of Shehu Shagari College of Education, Sokoto, who was murdered over alleged blasphemy, has been buried. Samuel was laid to rest on Saturday in her hometown in Tunga Magajiya, Rijau LGA of Niger state. Her remains were buried around 6:30 pm at the Christian cemetery in Tunga Magajiya. Emmanuel Maaji, the uncle of the deceased who is a pastor at ECWA church, led the prayers before she was buried. A mob killed Deborah over alleged blasphemy on Thursday. Videos of the late student being stoned and beaten with sticks were shared on social media. Her killing had sparked outrage across the country, with Nigerians asking the government to fish out the perpetrators of the crime. There was also a flurry of condemnation from civil society organisations (CSOs), Muslim leaders and groups, most notably Muhammadu Abubakar, the Sultan of Sokoto. The police command in Sokoto had also announced the arrest of two suspects in connection with the killing. On Saturday morning, some Muslim youths in Sokoto took to the streets to protest the arrest of the suspects. The protesters were armed with placards that read: “Release our Muslim brothers”, “Muslims Are Not Terrorists”, and “Peaceful riot”. Subsequently, Aminu Tambuwal, governor of Sokoto, declared a curfew in parts of the state to quell the unrest.
