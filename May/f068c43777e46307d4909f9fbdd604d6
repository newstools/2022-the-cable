Inuwa Yahaya, governor of Gombe state, says Kayode Fayemi, Ekiti governor and presidential hopeful, has the capacity and knowledge the country needs “at this critical moment”. Femi Ige, spokesman of Kayode Fayemi Campaign Team, quoted the Gombe governor as saying this in a statement on Thursday. Fayemi paid a visit to the governor in Gombe on Wednesday. Yahaya said the Ekiti governor has served in various offices and this has made him the “best among the presidential aspirants”. “Fayemi has widely acknowledged experience, energy capacity, and deep knowledge,” he said. “These are the qualities we need at this critical moment in Nigeria. My brother Fayemi, you have our support because we are convinced that Nigeria needs you. “I have been encouraged by your consensus building capabilities and I personally encouraged you to step out for the big job and I’m happy that you have taken up the challenge.” On his part, Fayemi said if elected, he would prioritise security, economy, energy and job creation. “Any government who can successfully tackle this would have succeeded in bringing happiness to our country, discourage the urge to secede and address our perennial problem of youth restiveness,” he said. “I believe I have the education, the energy, the capacity and the knowledge to tackle this myriad of problems. “History has shown us that the richest or children of the richest have never ruled Nigeria. Tafawa Balewa was a teacher, Shagari an headmaster, Obasanjo had no money when he left prison, Umar Yar’Adua was a university teacher, Jonathan had no shoes and of course we know the background of our current president. “What Nigeria needs now are education, capacity, energy, experience which I have in abundance. “Nigeria needs a president who will make the Onitsha man feel comfortable in Sokoto and the Kano man to feel at home in Ibadan or Awka. I feel this best describes me and I promise not to let you down.”
