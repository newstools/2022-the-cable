Muhammadu Sanusi II, former Emir of Kano, has offered prayers for investors to invest in Nasarawa state. He spoke at the recently held Nasarawa Investment Summit 2022 (#NIS2022) themed “Diamond In The Rough – The Making of a New Investment Frontier”. John Mahama, former president of Ghana, delivered the keynote speech at the event. With Mahama seated beside him, Sanusi said with a laugh, “To his excellency, the governor of Nasarawa state, I pray God to unleash investors on your state the way He unleashed presidential aspirants on the APC”. His prayer was met by widespread laughter from the audience including Mahama. Undeterred by the N100 million price tag of the party’s presidential ticket, over 20 aspirants have publicly declared their intention for the number one job in the land via the platform of the APC. Some of the presidential hopefuls include Vice-President Yemi Osinbajo; Bola Tinubu, former Lagos governor; Rotimi Amaechi, minister of transportation; Dave Umahi, Ebonyi state governor; Rochas Okorocha, former governor of Imo; Yahaya Bello, governor of Kogi state; Emeka Nwajiuba, minister of state for education; Ogbonnaya Onu, minister of science and technology; Kayode Fayemi, Ekiti state governor; Godswill Akpabio, minister of Niger Delta, amongst others. President Muhammadu Buhari, had, on May 11, directed all appointees seeking elective offices to resign on or before May 16. Following the directive, Amaechi, Onu and Akpabio resigned their positions as ministers to contest the presidency in the 2023 election. Nwajiuba had, in April, resigned as minister of state for education to contest the presidency. Meanwhile, Chris Ngige, minister of labour and employment, has pulled out of the presidential race.
