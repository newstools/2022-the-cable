Mohammed Hayatu-Deen, a presidential hopeful on the platform of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP), says Nigeria needs visionary leadership to provide a safe, secure, and stable environment for citizens. Hayatu-Deen spoke on Monday when he met some PDP stakeholders in Yola, the capital of Adamawa. According to the former managing director of the now-defunct FSB International Bank, the country is in desperate need of leaders that can provide opportunities for every Nigerian to excel, irrespective of religious or ethnic considerations. “Adamawa has a very special place in my heart because of the many intersections with my place of birth,” he said. “The country is in dire need of seminal leadership that can provide the safe, secure and stable environment for a Nigeria that works for us all.” Hayatu-Deen added that if allowed to serve in the highest office in the land, he will make Nigeria work for everyone. Also speaking, Solomon Dalung, former minister of youth and sports development, who was part of the delegation, said the presidential hopeful is the kind of leader Nigeria needs. “On different projects, night and day, he would not sleep until we achieved our objectives and victory. I have told myself that until we get someone like him we don’t have a leader,” Dalung, who recently resigned his membership of the All Progressives Congress (APC), said. “We need someone who will take Nigeria and patiently nurture the country until it is back on the right path.” In his remarks, Abdurahman Bobboi, Adamawa PDP chairman, said Hayatu-Deen qualifies to serve the country at the highest level. “Nigerians need solutions; people who can sacrifice to put the country right. If we do not do right, we will not be forgiven by the next generation. We wish you the very best in your campaign for the party’s ticket,” he added.
