The house of representatives has cancelled the plenary session scheduled to take place on Monday. Yahaya Danzaria, clerk of the house, had said the legislators in the lower legislative chamber would meet on Monday to discuss critical national issues. TheCable had reported that the emergency plenary session was called to discuss the plan by domestic airlines to shut down owing to the rise in the price of aviation fuel. In a statement on Sunday, Danzaria said the emergency plenary session is cancelled because of the “near-resolution” of issues in the aviation sector. According to Danzaria, the house leadership will meet stakeholders in the aviation sector on Monday. “I am directed to inform all Hon Members, staff, media and the general public that the House hereby cancels the Emergency Plenary Session earlier scheduled for tomorrow 9th May, 2022,” the statement reads. “This cancellation follows from the near-resolution of some of the major critical issues in the Aviation Industry that necessitated the original notice. The House appreciates the positive concern, reaction and contributions of all Hon Members to these critical National issues. “However, the Leadership of the House will still meet with relevant stakeholders tomorrow 9th May, 2023 at 2pm.”
