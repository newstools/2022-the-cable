Air Peace says it will suspend all domestic and regional flight operations from May 9. On Friday, the Airline Operators of Nigeria (AON) had announced their decision to suspend flight operations from Monday. The flight suspension by Air Peace comes shortly after the AON insisted that the association will not back down on its plan to stop operations from Monday. “Airline operators are patriotic citizens and we are doing all we can to protect the flying public contrary to what some subjective schools of thought might suggest. This is a collective sacrifice for the common interest of our nation,” AON had said in a statement issued on Sunday. On its part, the management of Air Peace, in a statement, apologised for the difficulties the decision to suspend flights may cause, adding that customers will be given updates on any new development. “In line with the decision of the Airline Operators of Nigeria, AON, we hereby inform the public that from May 9, 2022, Air Peace will be suspending its domestic and regional flight operations till further notice,” the statement reads. “We regret the inconveniences which this development will cause the flying public. We shall keep you updated as the situation develops. “For enquiries on this and other customer service concerns, please contact our Call Center via 0700-35924-773223 or callcenter@flyairpeace.com.”
