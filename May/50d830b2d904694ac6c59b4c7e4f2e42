The United States has confirmed a case of monkeypox. Monkeypox is a rare viral infection that does not spread easily between people. It is usually a mild self-limiting illness and most people recover within a few weeks. However, severe illness can occur in some individuals. The infection can be spread when someone is in close contact with an infected person; however, there is a very low risk of transmission to the general population. According to a statement on Wednesday by the Massachusetts department of public health (DPH), the case is an adult male with recent travel to Canada. The DPH said it is working closely with the Centre for Disease Control, relevant local boards of health, and the patient’s health care providers to identify individuals who may have been in contact with the patient while he was infectious. It said the case poses no risk to the public, and the individual is hospitalised and in good condition. Also in Portugal, health authorities announced in Wednesday that five cases of monkeypox were confirmed in the country with 15 suspected cases under investigation. The authorities said all cases were identified this month in the area around the capital, Lisbon, in mostly young men. Spain and Canada also said it had detected eight and 13 suspected cases of monkeypox respectively that still needed to be confirmed. The cases in Spain were reported in homosexual men. The UK, while reporting on Wednesday that the the total number of monkeypox cases confirmed in England has now reached nine, said recent cases were predominantly in gay or bisexual men. It therefore advised men who are gay and bisexual to be on the alert. Earlier this month, the UK had detected its first recent case of monkeypox in individual who recently travelled from Nigeria.
