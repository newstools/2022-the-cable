The Lagos chapter of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) says six aspirants are vying for its governorship ticket for the 2023 elections. The aspirants are AbdulAzeez Adediran, visioner of the Lagos4Lagos movement; Adedeji Doherty, former chairman of the party; Ade Dosunmu, a former governorship candidate of the party; Rhodes Gbadebo, 2019 PDP senatorial candidate for Lagos west; David Kolawole and Jimi Karmal. Hakeem Amode, Lagos publicity secretary of the party, said the aspirants were screened by the Ahmed Makarfi-led panel at the zonal office in Ibadan on Thursday. “Eleven aspirants from Oyo, Lagos and Ogun states appeared before the panel in Ibadan,” Amode said. “The Lagos aspirants that appeared before the panel were Shamsideen Dosumu, AbdulAzeez Adediran, David Kolawole, Jimi Karmal, Adedeji Doherty and Rhodes Gbadebo.” Amode said the state had, on Wednesday, screened aspirants for the senate, house of representatives and the state house of assembly. Expressing gratitude to all the stakeholders and participants, Amode said the smoothness of the exercise was an indication that the party is ready for the 2023 elections. He said the screening was successful due to the calibre of aspirants that had come out to contest various seats in the 2023 elections. “The peaceful screening is an indication that PDP is ready to play fair in the coming elections,” he said. “PDP is very ready to take over Lagos, make governance about the people and give Lagos residents reasons to sleep with both eyes closed. “For this reason, the party has made sure the best and most capable hands within the party have come out to contest for the 2023 elections.” The PDP will conduct a national convention to nominate its presidential candidate for the 2023 elections on May 28 and May 29. The party has also fixed May 21 for the conduct of its governorship primary elections.
