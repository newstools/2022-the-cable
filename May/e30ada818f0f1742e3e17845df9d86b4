President Muhammadu Buhari says his administration will not relent in its quest to restore peace and stability in the country. Buhari said this on Monday during the 58th anniversary of the Nigeria Air Force (NAF) in Kano. The president said his administration’s investment in the air force has helped to “turn the tide” against terrorists. He promised that he will continue to give necessary and sufficient support to the NAF in the battle against insecurity from non-state actors. “The huge investment in the Nigeria Air Force has helped to turn the tide against terrorist and non-state actors in our nation,” he said. “In furtherance of our drive to continue to do more to support the airforce. Rest assured that our government is willing to do even more to ensure the provision of requisite support and the encouragement to overcome various security challenges. “This government will not rest until peace and stability are fully restored in the nation. I, therefore, urge you all to remain steadfast, committed and resolute and force ahead to achieve a more peaceful and prosperous Nigeria.” Last month, the Northern Elders Forum (NEF) had asked the president to “seriously consider” resigning over “failure to show appropriate response” to the country’s security challenges. However, the presidency responded by saying the calls for resignation will not solve the country’s security challenges.
