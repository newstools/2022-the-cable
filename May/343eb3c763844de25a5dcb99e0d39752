The Journalists for Democratic Rights (JODER), a non-governmental organisation, says the killing of Deborah Samuel, a female student of Shehu Shagari College of Education, could result in a national crisis if not properly handled. The student was said to have been attacked by a mob over comments allegedly considered to be an insult to Prophet Mohammed. A video of the student being attacked was shared on social media, and the incident was said to have occurred in the early hours of Thursday. Speaking on the development in a statement on Friday, the group said the incident represents a potential threat to the fragile peace in Nigeria, and asked President Muhammadu Buhari to ensure justice for Deborah. “The stoning and burning of a lady is a trait unknown to all religions and alien to the Nigerian constitution that everyone in the country is bound to uphold,” the statement reads. “The perpetrators have brought sorrow and pain not only to the family of the bereaved but have also diminished the collective humanity of the country. “These conducts are despicable. We call on the federal government and the Sokoto state government to take pro-active measures to ensure justice and also to punish the perpetrators of the inhuman murder. “Given the fragile nature of Nigeria and the growing religious and ethnic distrust, killings of this nature could fuel a national crisis. “Sokoto state has been one of the most peaceful states in Nigeria which has recorded less faith-induced violence. The current incidence raises the danger that several states in Nigeria may have become vulnerable to violence induced by faith.”
