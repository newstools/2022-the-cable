BHM said its nominations cut across capital markets communications, corporate social responsibility, crisis management, and geographic categories for the ‘MTN Public Offer’, ‘World Without Waste’, and the ‘Project Safe Up — My World of Bags’ campaigns, respectively. It added that the 2022 SABRE Awards EMEA, which “recognises superior achievement in branding, reputation and engagement” shortlisted over 400 campaigns selected from more than 2,000 entries. Expressing his delight at the multiple nominations, Ayeni Adekunle, BHM’s founder and chief executive officer, said, “We consider this recognition as a testament to the collective effort of our people, clients”. Also speaking on the nominations, Paul Holmes, chair of the SABRE jury, said: “It is fair to say that we have never seen so much good work from so many firms, including international agencies with growing African operations, and indigenous firms from multiple markets”. “What we have seen over the past few years in Africa is the investment of large multinationals in the continent, but also a wave of African entrepreneurship that has seen local firms across the continent producing high-quality creative and driving impressive media coverage and social engagement for their clients.” The 2022 SABRE Awards EMEA winners will be announced at The Guildhall in London on May 27, 2022.
