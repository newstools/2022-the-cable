Nigeria’s Flamingos have qualified for the final round of the U-17 Women’s World Cup following a 2-0 win over Egypt. Two early goals from Opeyemi Ajakaiye and Omowunmi Bello sealed victory for Bankole Olowookere’s girls. The game was held on Saturday night at the Petrosports Stadium, Cairo. Ajakaiye opened the scoring in the fifth minute with a strike from 25 metres out. Nine minutes later, Bello doubled the Flamingos’ lead from a well-taken corner kick by Oluwatuminininu Adeshina. The Flamingoes qualified for the last round on a 6-0 aggregate, having defeated their Egyptian counterparts 4-0 in Abuja last week. The Nigerian girls await the winner of the game between Ethiopia and South Africa to know their next opponents. The Ethiopian side had earlier trounced their South African counterparts 3-0 on the first leg fixture in Johannesburg. This year’s FIFA U17 Women’s World Cup will take place in India between October 11 and 30.
