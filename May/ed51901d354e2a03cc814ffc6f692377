Officials on Thursday discovered the mangled body of a dead man on runway 18R of Lagos international airport. The airport officials said a team from the Federal Airports Authority of Nigeria (FAAN) and the Nigeria Police Force evacuated the corpse from the runway after it was found on Thursday afternoon. The identity of the corpse could not be ascertained as of the time of this report, and it is yet to be determined if the dead man was knocked down by an aircraft taking off or landing on the runway. There was, however, no indication that the airport was shut owing to the incident. There have been several incidents on airports’ runways in Nigeria in the past. Recently in November, a truck belonging to Skyway Aviation Handling Company Plc (SAHCO) collided with a Max Air aircraft at Nnamdi Azikiwe International Airport in Abuja. The truck was reportedly on course to provide services when it collided with the aircraft, causing damage to the vehicle and aircraft. A similar incident happened in 2015 at Murtala Muhammed International Airport in Lagos — two aircraft belonging to FirstNation Airways collided at the second terminal of the airport. About 250 passengers were on board during the incident.
