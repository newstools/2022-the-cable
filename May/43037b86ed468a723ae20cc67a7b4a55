Pat Utomi, a professor of political economy and co-convener of the National Consultative Front (NCFront), has stepped down his presidential ambition for Peter Obi, former governor of Anambra. Utomi announced the decision on Monday during the national convention of the Labour Party (LP). The national convention is taking place in Asaba, Delta state. TheCable had reported that Utomi and Obi are the two leading presidential hopefuls of the LP. Prior to the national convention, Eragbe Anselm, national youth leader of LP, who was eyeing the party’s presidential ticket, stepped down and declared support for the former governor. The development means that the coast is clear for Obi to become the presidential candidate of the LP. On Friday, the former Anambra governor joined LP hours after announcing the resignation of his membership of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP). He said his decision to join LP aligns with the interest of Nigerians across different sectors, adding that he wants to take the country from consumption to production. “Therefore, I have chosen a route that I consider to be in line with our aspirations and my mantra of taking the country from consumption to production; and that is the Labour Party which is synonymous with the people, workers, development, production, securing and uniting Nigerians as one family,” Obi had said.
