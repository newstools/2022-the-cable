The spelling competition which featured four schools from the community took place on Thursday.

Speaking with one of the teachers, we get to know that they need more of this. And there’s no better way to celebrate Children’s Day than giving them an opportunity to better themselves,” Joseph said. <img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-704405" src="https://f5p3e9e4.stackpathcdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/IMG-20220527-WA0007.jpg" alt="" width="600" height="809" /> “It’s important that education is taken very seriously If only a privileged few are the beneficiaries of quality education while others are neglected, they will be an imbalance. In fact, those that are lacking will end up influencing others. We are trying to create something of a balance and give the opportunity to those who strive.”
