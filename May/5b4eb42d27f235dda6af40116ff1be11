The supreme court has affirmed a N6 billion fine imposed on Dakuku Peterside, former director-general of the Nigerian Maritime Administration and Safety Agency (NIMASA), for defaming Peter Odili, former Rivers governor. Odili had in October 2016 dragged Peterside to court demanding N6 billion as damages for defaming his character. In the suit, Odili had claimed that Peterside, during a press conference in Port Harcourt, defamed him by alleging that he aided Nyesom Wike’s supreme court victory because his wife was a justice of the apex court. A high court in Rivers state had granted Odili’s request and imposed N6 billion fine as damages against Peterside — a judgment which was affirmed by the appellate court. Delivering its decision on the appeal on Friday, the supreme court dismissed Dakuku’s plea for want of merit. The lead judgment which was prepared by  Amina Augie was delivered by Adamu Jauro.
