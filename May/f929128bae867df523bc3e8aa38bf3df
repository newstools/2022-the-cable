Abdullahi Ganduje, governor of Kano, has reportedly withdrawn from contesting a seat on the senate in the 2023 general election. Ganduje’s reported withdrawal comes shortly after he was said to have met with Barau Jibrin, senator representing Kano north senatorial district. Ganduje and Barau were said to have met in Abuja over the weekend to undergo screening ahead of the All Progressives Congress (APC) primaries. Inside sources said the duo held a reconciliatory meeting, facilitated by some party’s stakeholders, after which they resolved the matter over who would represent the senatorial district “amicably”. Both men have been at loggerheads, following the decision of Jibrin to join Ibrahim Shekarau, a former governor of Kano, to form a faction of the APC in the state after the party’s congress in 2021. As part of the resolutions at the reconciliation meeting, the governor reportedly agreed to withdraw his senatorial ambition for Jibrin, who had also obtained the party’s expression of interest and nomination forms. Ibrahim Sarina, APC secretary in Kano, when contacted via telephone on Monday, confirmed the development. “It is true. The report is true,” Sarina said.
