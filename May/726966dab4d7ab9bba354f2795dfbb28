Mele Kyari, group managing director, Nigerian National Petroleum Company (NNPC) Limited, says the Train 7 project will be completed within four years. Nigeria LNG Train 7 project is a $10 billion project expected to add around 8 million tonnes a year of liquefied natural gas to NLNG Kyari disclosed this on Tuesday at the World Gas Conference in Daegu, Korea. He said the country is making efforts to grow in Liquefied Natural Gas (LNG), adding that contractors are on site for the project. “The Train 7 project is expected to be completed in four years,” Kyari said. “It is obvious our business in gas creates a real opportunity. The world has accepted that gas is the cleaner fuel, no doubt about it, and beyond this, it is the most basic and most acceptable transition fuel. “Opportunities are there for technology, investment, and also for adding supply so we can curtail those issues around the energy deficiency and energy poverty that we see across the globe.” He added that the Dangote refinery project will start operation in the first quarter (Q1) of 2023. Last year, NNPC acquired a 20 per cent stake in the 650,000-barrels-per-day refinery in Lagos owned by Aliko Dangote, president and chief executive officer (CEO) of Dangote Group. TheCable had reported that Dangote said his oil refinery would be commissioned before the end of President Muhammadu Buhari’s tenure, adding that the refinery will begin processing crude by the third quarter (Q3) of 2022.
