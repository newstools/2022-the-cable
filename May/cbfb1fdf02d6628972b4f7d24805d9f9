Alphonsus Uboh, a Catholic priest in Akwa Ibom, has been kidnapped by gunmen from the premises of his church in Mkpat Enin LGA of the state. The Akwa Ibom police command confirmed the incident to NAN on Monday. Odiko Macdon, police public relations officer of the state, said Uboh was abducted at about 7:30 pm on Sunday from where he resided within the church premises, along the Ekparakwa Etinan road. “Preliminary findings show that the abductors, who came with two motorcycles, went to the back fence of the victim’s house, and whisked him away,” he said. “The Commissioner of Police, Andrew Aniengheme, was very saddened at the development and said it is unacceptable.” Macdon said the police will put in efforts to ensure the safe rescue of the priest, and apprehend the abductors. The development comes days after John Okoriko, founder of Solid Rock Kingdom Church, was abducted by gunmen in Akwa Ibom state. The cleric was said to have been kidnapped when armed men invaded the church’s headquarters in Ibekwe Akpanya, Mkpat Enin LGA of the state on April 19. Okoriko, however, regained his freedom after spending four days in captivity.
