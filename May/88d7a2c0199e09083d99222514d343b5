Four persons including two Catholic priests have been reportedly abducted in Katsina state. The gunmen were said to have invaded the rectory of St. Patrick’s Catholic Church, Gidan Maikamb in Kafur LGA early Wednesday morning. Katsina is one of the four states overseen by Matthew Kukah, Catholic bishop of the Sokoto diocese. Christopher Omotosho, director of social communications, Catholic diocese of Sokoto, confirmed the incident in a statement. “As at midnight of today, 25th May, 2022, gunmen broke into the rectory of St. Patrick’s Catholic Church, Gidan Maikambo, Kafur LGA of Katsina State,” the statement reads. “The parish priest and his assistant Rev. Frs. Stephen Ojapa, MSP, and Oliver Okpara and 2 other boys in the house were kidnapped. No information as to their whereabouts. Kindly pray for their safety and release.” When contacted, Isah Gambo, police spokesperson in Katsina, told TheCable that he is yet to confirm details of the incident. “I have not received any kind of that report. I have been trying to get DPO of that area but I couldn’t,” he said. Priests are increasingly being targeted by gunmen across the country. In March, gunmen killed two people and abducted Joseph Aketeh, a catholic priest; a woman and two children in Kaduna. A few weeks ago, Joseph Bako, a Catholic priest who was abducted from his residence at St. John Catholic Church, Kudenda, Kaduna, was found dead.
