Kola Abiola, son of the late MKO Abiola, has declared his intention to contest the presidency on the platform of the Peoples Redemption Party (PRP). He received the party’s expression of interest and nomination forms on Thursday from Babatunde Alli, PRP’s secretary, in Abuja. Speaking on what he hopes to achieve if elected, Abiola, who joined PRP in April 2022, said part of his focus will be on promoting unity. “What I know for sure is that I have the interest of Nigerians at heart. I’m sentimentally, emotionally charged by Nigeria,” he said. “The way and method in which things are going in Nigeria, I’m afraid that if somebody who is not symbolic enough cannot hold it together, we’ll have a problem if we don’t start making that difference.” Abiola also said the party will not adopt consensus method for selecting its presidential candidate. “We have two other candidates. We believe in internal party democracy; we are not doing consensus. It is a transparent party. The more candidates we have the better,” he said. “Whoever wins, we will all come together and work for the party — not somebody calling for consensus where someone will step down for another. “Let’s go and have a competitive environment. It will be transparent and we will uphold internal democracy and be able to have proper democracy.” The party’s presidential nomination nomination and expression of interest forms cost N10 million. Meanwhile, PRP has extended the deadline for the sale of forms till May 18, 2022.
