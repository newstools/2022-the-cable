Gunmen have killed 12 farmers in Gakurdi village, Jibia LGA of Katsina state. The gunmen were said to have attacked the village in the early hours of Tuesday and started shooting sporadically. TheCable understands that the gunmen entered the village on four motorcycles while residents were on their farmlands. While the attack lasted, the gunmen burnt down houses and farmlands, while several residents sustained injuries. Confirming the incident, Gambo Isah, Katsina police spokesperson, said the military and police have been mobilised to the area, adding that the topography of the village is bad, given its remote location. Isah said the villagers recently acquired local arms to protect them against terrorists, saying it might be the reason for the attack. “It happened. Twelve people were killed in Gakurdi village. Terrorists on four motorcycles, each carrying two persons attacked the village and started shooting sporadically,” he said. “The residents of the village ran into the bush but the terrorists shot them at a close range.” Over the past few days, farmers have become easy targets for gunmen, especially in the northern part of the country. Recently, over 40 farmers were killed after insurgents invaded farms in Rann, Kala-Balge LGA of Borno state.
