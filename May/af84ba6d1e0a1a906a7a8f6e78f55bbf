Charles Soludo, governor of Anambra state, on Friday, visited Nnamdi Kanu, leader of the Indigenous People of Biafra (IPOB), in detention. The governor, who posted pictures of the meeting on his Facebook page on Saturday, said they discussed the sit-at-home protests and killings in the south-east. “I visited Mazi Nnamdi Kanu, yesterday, (Friday, 13th May, 2022) to felicitate with him and also as part of the wider consultations with critical stakeholders in search of lasting peace and security in the South East,” the governor wrote. “He was in very high spirits and we had quality and frank discussion in a very convivial atmosphere. He expressed sadness over what he described as “sacrilegious killings” of innocent persons, kidnappings and all forms of criminalities, including the brutal enforcement of the senseless “sit at home” perpetuated by sundry groups claiming to be acting for or on behalf of IPOB. “He assured that if the opportunity arises, he will be glad to personally broadcast to his followers to maintain the peace.” Soludo had, in April 2022, called on the federal government to speed up the trial of Kanu so he may be convicted or freed instead of being kept “in indefinite detention”. Kanu is standing trial on a 15-count charge bordering on treasonable felony, eight of which were recently struck out by a federal high court in Abuja.
