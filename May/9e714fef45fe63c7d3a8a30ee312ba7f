Thugs, on Saturday, invaded the venue of the primary conducted by the All Progressives Congress (APC) to elect a candidate for the Kaduna north senatorial district. According to NAN, there are three aspirants seeking the senatorial ticket — Sani Sha’aban, in-law to President Muhammadu Buhari’s; Suleman Kwari, an incumbent senator, and Haliru Ibrahim. However, following the invasion of the venue, cameras and other electronic gadgets of some journalists covering the event were seized. The items were alleged to have been confiscated by loyalists of one of the aspirants. Delegates from the Sabon Gari area of Kaduna were called to cast their votes, when the incident occurred. The thugs were said to have brandished different kinds of weapons and injured some delegates. When contacted for comments on the incident, Mohammed Jalige, Kaduna police spokesman, did not respond to calls.
