Vice-President Yemi Osinbajo has asked the All Progressives Congress (APC) delegates in Jigawa to “do what’s in the best interest of Nigeria” when voting for the party’s presidential candidate. The vice-president spoke on Sunday during a visit to stakeholders and delegates of the APC in Jigawa ahead of the party’s presidential primary. Osinbajo is one of the over 20 aspirants vying for the presidential ticket of the ruling party. During the interaction with the delegates, Osinbajo reiterated his position that choices concerning the 2023 elections should be based on the future. “We should make a decision based on the future of our children,” he said. “We can make progress, we can move on. All I ask you to do is what is in the best interest of Nigeria; vote in the interest of our children.” <img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-699246" src="https://f5p3e9e4.stackpathcdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/Osinbajo3.jpeg" alt="" width="1080" height="720" srcset="https://f5p3e9e4.stackpathcdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/Osinbajo3.jpeg 1080w, https://f5p3e9e4.stackpathcdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/Osinbajo3-300x200.jpeg 300w, https://f5p3e9e4.stackpathcdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/Osinbajo3-1024x683.jpeg 1024w, https://f5p3e9e4.stackpathcdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/Osinbajo3-768x512.jpeg 768w, https://f5p3e9e4.stackpathcdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/Osinbajo3-24x16.jpeg 24w, https://f5p3e9e4.stackpathcdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/Osinbajo3-36x24.jpeg 36w, https://f5p3e9e4.stackpathcdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/Osinbajo3-48x32.jpeg 48w" sizes="(max-width: 1080px) 100vw, 1080px" /> He also reiterated that his governance training and experience as vice-president under President Muhammadu Buhari will enable him to successfully lead the country if he gets the presidential ticket and wins the main election. “As vice president, the president has given me an opportunity that I do not think any other vice president has been given,” he said. <img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-699247" src="https://f5p3e9e4.stackpathcdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/Osinbajo2.jpeg" alt="" width="1080" height="720" srcset="https://f5p3e9e4.stackpathcdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/Osinbajo2.jpeg 1080w, https://f5p3e9e4.stackpathcdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/Osinbajo2-300x200.jpeg 300w, https://f5p3e9e4.stackpathcdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/Osinbajo2-1024x683.jpeg 1024w, https://f5p3e9e4.stackpathcdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/Osinbajo2-768x512.jpeg 768w, https://f5p3e9e4.stackpathcdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/Osinbajo2-24x16.jpeg 24w, https://f5p3e9e4.stackpathcdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/Osinbajo2-36x24.jpeg 36w, https://f5p3e9e4.stackpathcdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/Osinbajo2-48x32.jpeg 48w" sizes="(max-width: 1080px) 100vw, 1080px" /> While speaking with journalists after the meeting, Osinbajo expressed happiness with the interaction with the Jigawa delegates. “Obviously, all the issues that we discussed are issues that concern the country very significantly. We talked about agriculture, we talked about youth empowerment, education, technology and a wide variety of issues,” he said. “I think it was extremely fruitful, and at least we all understand where we are coming from and where we ought to be in the few years ahead. All of us are very happy that we were able to have this engagement.”
