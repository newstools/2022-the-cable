The Coalition for Whistleblowers Protection and Press Freedom (CWPPF) has called for an investigation into the attack on journalists who covered the governorship campaign in Osun on May 23. According to a report by Premium Times, unidentified persons wielding clubs, charms, stones and axes attacked the National Union of Journalists (NUJ) vehicle conveying over 23 journalists out of the campaign venue of Governor Gboyega Oyetola in Gbonga LGA of Osun. Joshua Dada of Leadership Newspaper, Victor Adeoti of the News Agency of Nigeria, Sunday Oguntuyi of HallMark Newspaper and Shina Abubakar of Vanguard Newspaper were said to have been injured in the attack. In a statement on Friday, CWPPF condemned the act, describing it as “a crime against democracy”. The coalition called on the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) and the police to institute mechanisms for protecting journalists and other media professionals on electoral duty. “The Coalition for Whistleblowers Protection and Press Freedom (CWPPF) seeks immediate investigation into this dastardly act and demands that persons responsible for the dreadful conduct be immediately brought to book,” the statement reads. “The Coalition considers attacks on journalists and observers covering electoral processes and elections as crimes against democracy and reports from previous elections show that the related freedom of the press were not recognised or respected. “We demand for a change and as the Osun state governorship election approaches on the 16th of July, 2022, CWPPF calls on the Independent National Electoral Commission and the Police to institute mechanisms for protecting journalists and other media professionals on electoral duty “Relatedly, CWPPF calls on the Federal Government of Nigeria to take a stand for Press Freedom and renew its respect for the rule of Law by directing appropriate agencies of the government to collaborate with the police to bring perpetrators of  the attacks on journalists to justice.”
