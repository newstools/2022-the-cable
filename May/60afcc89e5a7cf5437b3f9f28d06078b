The national working committee (NEC) of the Peoples Democratic Party has shifted the date for the conduct of its governorship primaries across the country. The development is the second time the opposition party will be shiting its governorship and parliamentary primaries. The gubernatorial primaries were initially scheduled to take place on May 21 but were shited to May 23. In the updated timetable, the PDP said the governorship primaries will now take place on May 25. The opposition party also adjusted the dates for state and national assembly primaries as follows: In a letter addressed to the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC), the PDP said the dates were adjusted owing to “unforeseen circumstances”. According to the letter signed by Iyorchia Ayu and Samuel Anyanwu, PDP national chairman and secretary respectively, the senatorial district primaries in the south-east will take place on Tuesday, May 24 “due to the sit-at-home currently being observed on Mondays”. The special convention where delegates from across the country are expected to elect a candidate to represent the PDP in the 2023 presidential election will take place on May 28.
