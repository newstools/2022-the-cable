Some aggrieved residents of the federal capital territory (FCT) have blocked the Gwagwalada-Giri expressway over the tenure elongation of the incumbent area council chairmen. TheCable learnt that the six-lane road was made impassable for motorists following the decision of Bello Mohammed, FCT minister, to suspend the inauguration of the elected chairmen. According to a resident of the area, the protesters, who were seen burning tyres to make bonfires, called for the swearing-in of the six elected chairmen, an event earlier scheduled for today. TheCable learnt that the incumbent chairmen were meant to vacate office on Thursday after three years in the position. But based on the ruling of a federal high court owing to the recently signed Electoral Act 2022, their tenures in office were extended to four years. Earlier in the morning, the protesters trooped to the minister’s office located in Area 11 to demand the inauguration of the elected council chairmen.
