Waziri Adio, former executive secretary of the Nigeria Extractive Industries Transparency Initiative (NEITI), on Saturday, had a reading and signing of his book, ‘Arc of the Possible’. The book reading was held at The Booksellers, Nurnberger plaza, Abuja. The event was hosted by Folarin Mosuro, a member of The Booksellers, with readings from the book also done by Wale Aladejana and Karis Ikeokwu. ‘The Arc of the Possible’, a publication of Cable Books, has 25 chapters spanning five sections and nearly 300 pages. In the memoir, Adio chronicles his days in office at NEITI and the hurdles he faced trying to stay true to his values. The book also captures the ideas he tried to bring into his job, especially in the policy arena, and the lessons he believes all who want to serve in public office in Nigeria need to imbibe. On whether he is worried that all he did at NEITI would be reversed, the policy strategist said all that matters is that he made an impact in his own little way. “You’re not doing it because you don’t want what you’ve done to be reversed, you’re doing it because this is what you believe in. And even if it doesn’t have that immediate impact, you never know,” he said. <img src="https://f5p3e9e4.stackpathcdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/IMG-20220522-WA0031.jpg" alt="" width="1280"
