Ayo Adebanjo, leader of Afenifere, says Vice-President Yemi Osinbajo wants to succeed President Muhammadu Buhari to “continue with insecurity and poverty”. On April 11, Osinbajo declared his intention to contest the 2023 presidency on the platform of the All Progressives Congress (APC). During the presidential declaration, the vice-president had said if he is elected president, he will complete the projects started by President Muhammadu Buhari. Speaking on Sunday in an interview on Channels, the Afenifere leader criticised the Buhari-led federal government over its handling of the country’s security challenges. Adebanjo accused the president of having a “private agenda” about the country while insisting that Buhari understands how to restructure the country to bring about peace. “Former President Olusegun Obasanjo told them that the creation of state police is the solution to the country’s insecurity. Let each state take care of its own security. Let them be armed,” the Afenifere leader said. “My view is that it is not that Buhari doesn’t know, but he has a private agenda, which everybody does not want to admit.” Asked if he has evidence of the president’s “private agenda”, the Afenifere leader said the president has not come out to deny the repeated claim of having a “private agenda”. “I have evidence. When I said he has a private agenda. When has he come to the public to say ‘who is saying I have a private agenda’. I mean well. Why should I not create state police?’ “Since he (referring to the president) has been in office, has he addressed the nation during May Day? When he wants to talk to us, he goes abroad. What is he doing so well? “What is the value of the naira in 2015? What is the value now? How much were we buying petrol in 2015? How much is it now? “The vice-president, Yemi Osinbajo, now said he wants to succeed him and continue his works and continue the insecurity and poverty.”
