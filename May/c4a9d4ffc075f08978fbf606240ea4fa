Fifty people including security operatives have been reportedly killed in an attack on three communities in Bakura LGA of Zamfara state. The gunmen were said to have invaded the communities — Sabon Garin Damri, Damri and Kalahe — on Friday afternoon. According to Premium Times, residents said over 50 people were killed in the attacks. Several people were reportedly injured while houses were set ablaze by the armed men. The assailants eventually retreated after security operatives reinforced and engaged them. Efforts to reach Muhammed Shehu, police public relations officer (PPRO) in Zamfara, to comment on the attacks was unsuccessful as his phone was switched off. The development is the latest in a string of gunmen attacks in the north-western state. In April, the son of Ibrahim Mamman Tsafe, commissioner of security and home affairs in the state, was shot dead by bandits. The assailants reportedly opened fire near the commissioner’s residence, in Tsafe town, Tsafe LGA of the state, killing his son and three persons, while a few others suffered gunshot wounds. Weeks before the attack, 16 people were killed when gunmen overran Ganar-Kiyawa village in Bukkuyum LGA of the state. The gunmen were said to have invaded the neighbourhood and started shooting at locals, including the village head.
