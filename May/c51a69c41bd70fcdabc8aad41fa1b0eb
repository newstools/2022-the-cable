Peter Obi, former governor of Anambra and presidential hopeful, has resigned his membership of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP). He disclosed his intention to resign in a letter addressed to the party. The former governor’s decision to leave the PDP comes days before the party’s presidential primary is scheduled to hold. In the letter dated May 24, 2022, and addressed to the PDP national chairman, Obi said recent developments in the party do not support “constructive contributions”. “I am writing to intimate you of my resignation from the Peoples Denocratic Party (PDP), which was conveyed to the Chairman of Agulu Ward 2, Anaocha LGA, Anambra, effective Friday 20 May, 2022,” the letter reads. “Consequently, I am by this letter informing you of my withdrawal for the PDP Presidential Primaries. “It has been a great honour to contribute to nation-building efforts through our party. Unfortunately, recent developments within our party make it practically impossible to continue participating and making such constructive contributions. “Our national challenges are deep-seated and require that we each make profound sacrifices towards rescuing our country. My commitment to rescuing Nigeria remains firm, even if the route differs. “I wish to thank you personally for your graciousness and leadership. I wish you well and best of luck in the service of country.” Obi has, however, not announced if he will join a new party to contest the presidency in the general election.
