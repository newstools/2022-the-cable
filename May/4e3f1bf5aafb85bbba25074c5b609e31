Bola Tinubu, presidential hopeful on the platform of the All Progressives Congress (APC), says he will work to tackle hunger if he becomes Nigeria’s next president. Tinubu said this on Tuesday in Gombe when he visited the palace of Abubakar Shehu-Abubakar III, the Emir of Gombe. Tinubu, who was in Gombe to meet APC delegates on his presidential ambition, also said part of his focus, if elected president, would be to provide an environment in which Nigerians can thrive. “If elected as the president of Nigeria, and Insha Allah, I will be, I will work with the successful governors to make things better,” he said. “We will work and banish hunger. We will work and reset Nigeria’s prosperity, so that all of us will enjoy the reward of our labour in this country.” Hours before the visit to Gombe, Tinubu had, on Tuesday, met with APC delegates in Katsina, where he spoke on how he would improve the agricultural sector. “Katsina has many dams. We will work with the state to reticulate them. We will do this to combat irrigation. Katsina has the resources to be an industrial hub, to be a centre for industrialisation and prosperity,” he had said. Tinubu also urged the delegates to support him at the presidential primary. “Anybody can contest; not anybody has what it takes to be president. I have the vision, the passion, the capacity and the competence to deliver for the country,” he said.
