Femi Adesina, special assistant to President Muhammadu Buhari on media and publicity, says he plans to go back to journalism and also become a farmer when he leaves government. Adesina said this on Wednesday, when he received members of the Edo chapter of the All Farmers Association of Nigeria (AFAN), in his office. The presidential spokesman, in a post on his Facebook page, said he was surprised when the farmers offered to make him their patron, adding that “they have seen tomorrow”. “When I finish in government, by the mercies of God, I intend to return to active media work, and also be a farmer. May God make it happen. Amen,” he said. “It was then a big surprise to me when I got notification from the All Farmers Association of Nigeria (Edo State Chapter), saying they were coming to make me a Patron of the group. I asked myself: ‘how did they know I was planning to go into farming? They must have seen tomorrow’. “And true to their words, the farmers came. Farmers of cassava, cucumber, pineapples, fish, cattle, and other crops and livestock. And they made me their patron. Men, women, and youth. “This is a surprising honour. I could only promise the farmers that I would continue to serve the President, and my country to the best of my ability.” Bako Dogwo, chairman of the group, said the farmers decided to make Adesina their patron as a result of his “antecedents”. “We wish to congratulate you as you are being appointed patron based on your antecedents. We say big congratulations, and look forward to see you rising higher,” Dogwo was quoted as saying.
