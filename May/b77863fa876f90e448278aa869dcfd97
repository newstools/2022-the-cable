The Confederation of African Football (CAF) has approved the use of the Moshood Abiola National Stadium, Abuja for the qualifiers for the 2023 Africa Cup of Nations (AFCON). The approval, which was contained in a letter written to the Nigeria Football Federation (NFF) and dated May 1, comes at about the same time when FIFA sanctioned Nigeria over fans’ invasion of the Abuja stadium. The approval also ended speculations that the facility would be barred from hosting international matches in the wake of crowd disturbances after the March 29 second leg World Cup 2022 playoff game between Super Eagles and Black Stars of Ghana. In its sanction, FIFA ruled that the AFCON 2023 qualifier involving Nigeria and Sierra Leone at the Abuja stadium, scheduled for next month, would be played behind closed doors. The world governing body also imposed a fine of $150,000 on Nigeria over the disturbances that trailed the World Cup playoff. Next year’s AFCON is expected to be hosted by Cote d’Ivoire.
