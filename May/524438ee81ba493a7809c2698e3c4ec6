Grooming Centre, a non-governmental organisation (NGO) that focuses on enabling financial inclusion among market women and artisans, has launched a photobook on 30 resilient women. The photobook is entitled: ‘The Stories of Impact: Real Women, Real Lives, Real Growth’. Grooming Centre is an NGO founded in 2006 to address the perennial challenge of access to credit at the grassroots. According to the NGO, the launch of the photobook, which celebrated the courage of 30 women and their life-changing journey, was held on Thursday at the Grooming Centre multi-purpose hall in Ejigbo, Lagos. Speaking at the event, Akindele Akinsoye, chief executive officer (CEO) of Platform Capital, co-sponsors of the event, eulogised women, saying the future belongs to them. “The work that Grooming Centre is doing is very important because by helping women build sustainable enterprises, tooling them, scaling them, skilling them, they are preparing them to build bigger businesses in the future, being that the micro segment is the conveyor belt of big corporations,” Akinsoye said. Oby Ezekwesili, a former minister of education, while reviewing the book, lauded the organisation for its phenomenal work. “It is a book that should claim a stand on the shelf of development books,” she said. She pointed out some development issues highlighted in the book, including the fact that 60 percent of businesses by women do not have access to finance, a situation which hampers growth. Since its inception, the centre said it has provided 12 million credits and currently empowers 720,000 client members by providing financial and non-financial services through a network of 605 branches in 26 states and the federal capital territory (FCT).
