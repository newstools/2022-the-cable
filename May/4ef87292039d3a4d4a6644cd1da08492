Ita Enang, presidential adviser on Niger Delta affairs, says he has resigned his appointment to pursue his Akwa Ibom governorship bid. Enang served as special assistant to the president on national assembly (senate) between 2015 and 2019. Buhari appointed him as the aide on Niger Delta affairs in 2019. In a statement on Monday, Edet Ekpenyong, media aide to Enang, said the presidential aide thanked President Muhammadu Buhari for the opportunity to serve. “The time has come. I intend to contest for the governorship of Akwa Ibom state on the platform of our party, the APC, for which I now seek nomination, having purchased and submitted the nomination and expression of interest forms,” he said. “I hereby formally tender my resignation from office, to pursue gubernatorial electoral cause. “In August 2015, upon your inauguration, Your Excellency graciously appointed me as the Senior Special Assistant to The President on National Assembly matters — senate — and presidential liaison to the national assembly. “I served in this capacity managing what turned out to be the toughest executive-legislative liaison assignment in the nation’s democratic history. “I served beyond your first term into your second term, working with the party leadership to elect the current senate presiding officers in accordance with the desire of the party, managing the screening and clearance of your second term ministers among others, which has given your second term administration greater stability and peace with the legislature.”
