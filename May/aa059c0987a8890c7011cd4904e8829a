Kayode Fayemi, governor of Ekiti, says if elected president, he would establish an All Progressives Congress (APC) school to groom leaders within the party. The Ekiti governor is one of the presidential hopefuls of the ruling party. Speaking when he hosted a group known as National Prosperity Movement in Abuja on Monday, Fayemi said the school will also be used for the induction and training of APC officials. “Invigorating our elected party structures will also involve a much closer attention to our programmes and policies,” he said. “To this end, I am committed to ensuring that every year, our party convenes a policy conference to review the progress we have made in carrying out our programmes and recalibrating our objectives and strategy in accordance with changing circumstances. “The project of an APC party school will also enjoy a breath of life under my watch and be used effectively for the induction and training of our officials, as well as leadership grooming and mentorship.” The presidential hopeful also said he will work with the Nigeria Governors Forum (NGF) to address the challenges confronting the country. Fayemi said he would collaborate with speakers of state assemblies to achieve a coordinated approach in addressing issues. “I intend to work with our governors to transform the Progressive Governors Forum (PGF) into a formidable autonomous body for policy advice in the administration of national affairs and the promotion of baseline standards in the management of the states controlled by our party,” he said. “Similar platforms for the speakers of our state houses of assembly and chairs of our local government councils will enjoy my support to become active fora for consultation, coordination, and harmonisation.”
