The federal government says the Abuja-Kaduna train service will resume operations on May 23. Yakubu Mahmood, spokesperson, Nigerian Railway Corporation (NRC), said this in a statement on Monday. In March, the government suspended operations on the route after an attack on the train by gunmen. Eight passengers died in the attack, while many were kidnapped. Mahmood said the decision to resume operations does not mean efforts to secure the safe release of those abducted would be shelved. “The government wishes to assure the relatives of the abducted citizens still in captivity that the safe rescue of these passengers is a top priority and not to misconstrue the resumption of train services, like abandonment or nonchalant attitude of the government towards their plight,” the statement reads. “The federal government will never abdicate its responsibility in rescuing these valuable citizens, however, the government assures of its resolve not to succumb to threats by any faceless group.” The resolve to resume train services on the route was reached even as most of the kidnapped passengers are still held captive by abductors. Relatives of the abducted passengers had warned the federal government against resuming operations along the route until their loved ones were rescued.
