Atiku Abubakar, former vice-president, has appealed to leaders and members of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) in Lagos to unite ahead of the 2023 general election. Atiku spoke on Friday during a consultation meeting with leaders and delegates of the PDP at the Ikoyi residence of Bode George, a chieftain of the PDP, in Lagos. He told the delegates that it is important for the PDP in the state to come under one umbrella as it’ll ensure the party wins the state as well as boost the party’s chances in the presidential election. “As you all know, the major theme of my campaign is unity. But I think we should share the same gospel of unity with the PDP in Lagos State. This call will require shifting of position and common understanding. But this is the sacrifice that we all have to make to ensure that the PDP wins Lagos state,” he said. “I have talked to leaders and elders of the party inside and I made a similar call on them. I am here with all of you too who are esteemed members of our party to please give the necessary support to our leaders and elders in making sure that the party is united.” In his remarks, George said the message of Atiku about unity is well taken and is an appeal that he is committed to. “It is not in doubt that Atiku knows Nigeria very well and Nigeria knows him too. The next election is the last battle of Berlin and it is necessary that we go into it with all the power and elements that we have,” he said. “In Lagos PDP, we shall be united. It is what we must do to win the next election. “In this upcoming election, Nigeria needs someone with the experience, capacity and deep knowledge of this country and you, Waziri, fits into that perfectly. “We wish you well in your campaign. I like the way you ended your remark about winning Lagos for the people of Lagos. We must end the era of Lagos belonging to a stranger.” <img class="aligncenter wp-image-695712" src="https://f5p3e9e4.stackpathcdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/IMG-20220506-WA0010.jpg" alt="" width="500" height="305" srcset="https://f5p3e9e4.stackpathcdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/IMG-20220506-WA0010.jpg 894w, https://f5p3e9e4.stackpathcdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/IMG-20220506-WA0010-300x183.jpg 300w, https://f5p3e9e4.stackpathcdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/IMG-20220506-WA0010-768x468.jpg 768w, https://f5p3e9e4.stackpathcdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/IMG-20220506-WA0010-24x15.jpg 24w, https://f5p3e9e4.stackpathcdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/IMG-20220506-WA0010-36x22.jpg 36w, https://f5p3e9e4.stackpathcdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/IMG-20220506-WA0010-48x29.jpg 48w" sizes="(max-width: 500px) 100vw, 500px" /> <img class="aligncenter wp-image-695714" src="https://f5p3e9e4.stackpathcdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/IMG-20220506-WA0009.jpg" alt="" width="550" height="262" srcset="https://f5p3e9e4.stackpathcdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/IMG-20220506-WA0009.jpg 1023w, https://f5p3e9e4.stackpathcdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/IMG-20220506-WA0009-300x143.jpg 300w, https://f5p3e9e4.stackpathcdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/IMG-20220506-WA0009-768x366.jpg 768w, https://f5p3e9e4.stackpathcdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/IMG-20220506-WA0009-24x11.jpg 24w, https://f5p3e9e4.stackpathcdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/IMG-20220506-WA0009-36x17.jpg 36w, https://f5p3e9e4.stackpathcdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/IMG-20220506-WA0009-48x23.jpg 48w" sizes="(max-width: 550px) 100vw, 550px" />
