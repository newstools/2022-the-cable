The Oniru chieftaincy family estate office says there are plans by okada riders to invade inner streets in Lekki. The warning comes hours after the Lagos government announced a ban on motorcycle operations in six LGAs. The decision on the ban was taken days after David Imoh, identified as a sound engineer, was said to have been lynched by commercial motorcyclists in the Lekki axis of Lagos state. According to a letter addressed to residents by the estate office on Wednesday, residents were advised to be “extremely cautious” and to also cooperate with the estate management on security measures that would be taken over the issue. “Intelligence report reaching us is that following the raid on okada riders, and seizure of their bikes in Lekki phase 1, the riders believed the action was instigated by Lekki residents who are determined to take away their source of livelihood,” the letter reads. “To this end, there are plans to invade inner streets to cause havoc anytime from now in Lekki. “In its proactive measures, His Royal Majesty, the Oniru of Iru Land, Oba Abdulwasiu Omogbolahan Lawal (Abisogun II), has advised that all access points within the Estate be secured and all security guards should be on red alert. “This is an emergency measure, not panic. “This intelligence is from our security services provider. May we advise all residents to be extremely cautious and please collaborate with security guards at the gates. “We had the same experience during the end SARS protest and activated the same precautionary measures being advised by our security providers. “Vigilance Please!”
