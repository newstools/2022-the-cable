The Niger Delta Development Commission (NDDC) says it has revoked unexecuted contracts awarded between 2000 and 2019 following a directive from the presidency. Ibitoye Abosede, director of corporate affairs, NDDC, said this in a statement issued on Sunday in Port Harcourt. Abosede said the cancellation followed recommendations of the recently-concluded forensic audit report by the NDDC. She added that all contractors affected are required to refund monies received for the project. “This is to bring to the notice of all contractors engaged by the NDDC as well as stakeholders and the general public, the implementation of the forensic audit report,” she said. “The Presidency has directed that all contracts awarded by the NDDC from 2000 to December 31, 2019, for which the beneficiary contractors are yet to mobilise to the sites, are cancelled. “Consequently, all affected contractors are advised to note that all monies earlier received by way of mobilisation for any of the projects are to be promptly refunded. “The contractors are to refund the monies to the commission’s account with the CBN.’’ Abosede said that the cancellation was subject to any future re-award in accordance with the Public Procurement Act. She added that the cancellation was also in line with the terms of the contracts for the projects. In February, some contractors, who identified themselves as members of the Niger Delta Indigenous Contractors Association, alleged that the Niger Delta Development Commission (NDDC) owed them over N2 trillion. The contractors had earlier picketed the headquarters of the NDDC in Port Harcourt, Rivers state, over the alleged outstanding debt.
