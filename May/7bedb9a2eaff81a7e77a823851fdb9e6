Olamilekan Adeola, senator representing Lagos west, has secured the ticket of the All Progressives Congress (APC) for Ogun west senatorial district. Adeola was announced winner of the primary held at Yewa south LGA of the state on Saturday. According to the APC primary electoral committee, Adeola, better known as Yayi, polled 294 votes to defeat Tolu Odebiyi, the incumbent senator representing the zone, who had no votes. Adeola had, earlier in May, wept when he received the expression of interest and nomination forms, said to have been purchased by some leaders of the APC from Yewa under the auspices of West to West for Dapo Abiodun (W2W4DA). The forms were presented to him at his country home in Ilaro. According to the group, 71 of them pooled their resources to raise the N20 million for the nomination form. Expressing his appreciation to the group, he had promised to represent them well if he gets the ticket. “In all my years of contesting elections for close to 20 years now, this is the first time I’m getting this kind of gesture, and to say the little, I’m very happy,” Adeola had said. “It is worthy to note that 71 people brought their hard-earned money together from about N50,000 from the least person, to N3 million from the biggest donor, to surprise the senator with the gesture. “It’s a new dawn in Ogun west. Like we say, it’s a new order for a new glory.” Meanwhile, Idiat Adebule, former deputy governor of Lagos, has secured the APC ticket for Lagos west senatorial district.
