The Taraba police command says its operatives rescued members of the All Progressives Congress (APC) election committee from being lynched in the state. The APC committee was in Taraba to organise the primaries for senatorial and house of representatives seats. According to NAN, a mob ambushed the committee members on Saturday and attempted to lynch them, but the quick intervention by the police saved the situation. The committee members were accused of conniving with some members to manipulate the election result. Speaking on the development  Abimbola Shokoya, commissioner of police in Taraba, said the police had taken custody of the committee members. He, however, said the police were not “interested in dabbling into partisan politics”, adding that the operatives carried out their duty to ensure the safety of lives and property. He also said the situation had been brought under control. The primaries to select candidates for elective positions on the platform of APC in Taraba have not been free from controversies. On Saturday, Lawrence Onuchukwu, chairman of the APC governorship primary election committee in Taraba, had alleged that he was forced at gunpoint to declare that he did not authorise the governorship primary to commence in the state due to unresolved issues. Onuchukwu had, on Friday, declared Emmanuel Bwacha, former deputy senate minority leader, as the winner of the APC governorship primary in the state.
