Mascot Kalu, brother of Orji Uzor Kalu, chief whip of the senate, has defected from the All Progressives Congress (APC) to Action Peoples Party (APP). The younger Kalu reportedly defected to APP on Wednesday. Reacting to the development in a Facebook post on Thursday, the former Abia governor said Abdullahi Adamu, APC national chairman, pleaded with his brother to remain in the party but he declined. The senator said he does not have any issue with his sibling as he has the right to pursue his political career as he deems fit. “I have received several calls from friends, associates, political stakeholders and leaders of thoughts seeking my opinion on the defection of my brother, Mascot, from the All Progressives Congress, APC, to Action Peoples Party, APP,” he said. “Sincerely, the National Chairman, two deputy national chairmen of our great party including the senate president persuaded him to remain with the APC but he declined. “I was surprised to hear that he alongside other stakeholders launched the new party, Action Peoples Party, APP, yesterday, in Umuahia without informing me. “Well, I don’t have any issue with my brother; he has the right to make decisions on his political future, and, as a democrat, I acknowledge his right to determine his political affiliation and wish him well. “I remain the chief whip of the senate and a committed member of the All Progressives Congress, APC. “I am even more determined to serve my people and facilitate more dividends of democracy to them.”
