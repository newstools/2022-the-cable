A Bayelsa resident, identified as Michael Isiah, has been reportedly killed after a fight broke out during the state house of assembly primary of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) in Ogbia, Bayelsa state. According to NAN, primaries took place in the eight LGAs of the state for the election of candidates that will contest the 24 seats in the Bayelsa house of assembly as well as seats in the federal house of representatives. Details of what led to the fight are, however, not clear. Daniel Iworiso-Markson, former Bayelsa commissioner for information and aspirant for Ogbia federal constituency seat on the platform of the PDP, confirmed the incident. Iworiso-Markson described the murder of Isaiah as sad, saying nobody’s life is worth taking for any political office. He also urged security agents to do everything possible to arrest and prosecute the killers of Isaiah. “Violence is not our culture. Personally, I do not subscribe to violence,’’ he said. “That is why all through my consultations and reach-out with stakeholders and delegates, I made it clear that I would not do anything to undermine the peace and unity in Ogbia. “It is indeed very sad and I call on security agents to do everything possible to arrest and prosecute those behind it. I also sympathise with the bereaved family over this avoidable loss.’’ Meanwhile, Asinim Butswat, police spokesperson in Bayelsa, when contacted, said he would have to get more information on the incident before he could make comments on it.
