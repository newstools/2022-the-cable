Senate President Ahmad Lawan has asked the All Progressives Congress (APC) delegates in Kano state to vote for him in the party’s presidential primary election. The presidential hopeful pleaded with the delegates when he met with them in Kano on Saturday night. Lawan said there is no propaganda that will convince anyone that the APC is not strong in Kano. “When His Excellency, our governor was rounding up his speech, he said Kano is a swing state and it can determine not only the Primaries, with 500 delegates, but also the general elections. Your Excellency, it will swing to my side by the Grace of God,” he said. “I want all the 500 delegates. In fact, I need all the 500 delegates Your Excellency. If I can’t have the 500, please let me have at least 400. “My brothers and sisters, distinguished delegates, I promise you that, when eventually we discuss and find common ground with His Excellency and vote for me, you will forever be pleased with the way and manner I will lead this country because it is not possible for anyone to lead the country like Nigeria without the presence and contributions of people like Governor Abdullahi Ganduje.” On his part, Abdullahi Ganduje, Kano governor, said under Lawan, the legislature and executive have enjoyed a cordial relationship. “If we can recall with nostalgia what happened between 2015 and 2019, we are all living witnesses that we had a lot of instability, poor relationship between the Legislature and the executive,” he said. “Infact, we had a situation where, in one day, 15 Senators from APC defected to PDP from the senate chamber. “Your Excellency, I’m saying all these things in order to show your political dexterity in managing the national assembly, in managing the relationship between the executive and the legislature.”
