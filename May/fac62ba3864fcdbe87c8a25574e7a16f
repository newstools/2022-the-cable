Security operatives, on Tuesday, shot into the air to disperse the crowd at the residence of Rochas Okorocha, senator representing Imo west. Earlier on Tuesday, operatives of the Economic and Financial Crimes Commission (EFCC) had besieged the residence of the senator to arrest him. Okorocha, former governor of Imo, had, however, declined to go with the EFCC operatives. Some of his supporters had later arrived his residence and protested the presence of the security operatives. But while this was on, the protesters were asked to leave but he refused, after which the security operatives fired into the air. Aside from the protesters, journalists and workers at the lawmaker’s house were sent away from the premises. Speaking on why the operatives were at the residence, Wilson Uwujaren, EFCC spokesperson, said the matter was linked to the ongoing court case involving Okorocha “The move followed the refusal of the former governor to honour invitations after jumping the administrative bail earlier granted him by the Commission,” Uwujaren said in a statement. “EFCC had on January 24, 2022, filed a 17-count criminal charge bordering on diversion of public funds and properties to the tune of N2.9 billion against Okorocha. “The case was assigned to Honourable Justice Inyang Ekwo of the Federal High Court, Abuja but attempts to arraign Senator Okorocha were twice stalled owing to the absence of the ex-governor who evaded service of processes. “At the last adjourned date, March 28th, 2022, Justice Ekwo before adjourning until May 30th, 2022, had warned that it was “the last adjournment I shall grant in this matter”. “In the circumstances, the Commission is left with no option than to effect the arrest of Senator Okorocha and bring him to trial.”
