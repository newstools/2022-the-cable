Kayode Fayemi, Ekiti governor and presidential hopeful, says if elected president, he will make the north-central zone Nigeria’s top tourism and mining destination. Femi Ige, spokesman of the Fayemi campaign organisation, quoted the governor as saying this when he met with All Progressives Congress (APC) delegates in Makurdi, Benue state. The presidential hopeful said he would bring an end to the farmer-herder crisis that has disrupted farming in the region. “While growing up, Jos was the top tourism destination in the country,” the chairman of the Nigeria Governors Forum (NGF) said. “It’s a wonderful climate, God given tourists sites and hospitable people ensured that. Today, banditry and incessant farmers/ herders has brought that industry crashing down. “Agriculture is affected, lives are lost unnecessarily. If given the opportunity, I promise to bring an end to this malaise and return this place to its pride of place as the leading tourism, mining hub and as the food basket of the nation. “I’m here to offer myself as a servant leader. I’ll work for the people, fair to everyone, just, equitable, courageous and heal the wounds of years of division by offering inclusiveness and giving everyone a sense of belonging.”
