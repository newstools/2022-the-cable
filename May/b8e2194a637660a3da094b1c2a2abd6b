The Nigeria Police Force (NPF) says it has arrested an officer who was seen dancing “in praise of a confraternity (cult)” in a video shared on social media. Olumuyiwa Adejobi, NPF spokesman, in a statement on Saturday, identified the officer as Isaac Matthew, a police corporal attached to the Ebonyi state command. Earlier on Saturday, a video had surfaced online showing the officer singing, dancing, and brandishing a rifle, while a song played in the background. According to the statement, Usman Baba, the inspector-general of police (IGP), condemned the act, adding that the officer’s actions were contrary to police regulations. “The act of the officer in question, which is clearly calculated to portray the NPF negatively, is a discreditable conduct in line with the provisions of the First Schedule to Regulation 370 of the Police Regulations,” the statement reads. “His actions equally violated the provisions of the NPF Social Media Policy (SMP), penal laws, and other extant laws regulating the conduct and discipline of all Police officers. “The Inspector-General of Police, IGP Usman Alkali Baba, psc(+), NPM, fdc, has directed the Commissioner of Police in charge of Ebonyi State to detail the Command’s OC Provost to hand over the erring officer to the Force Provost Marshall for necessary disciplinary actions.” The IGP also warned officers to ensure that their actions do not go contrary to police regulations, adding that violators would be sanctioned.
