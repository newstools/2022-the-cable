Ben Ayade, governor of Cross River and a presidential hopeful of the All Progressives Congress (APC), says he’s not worried about the ambition of Vice-President Yemi Osinbajo. Ayade and Osinbajo are among the growing list of APC politicians who have declared interest in running for the office of the president. On Thursday, Osinbajo visited Cross River for consultations with stakeholders and delegates of the ruling party. Ayade, who was present with other delegates and traditional leaders, said he is not disturbed by the ambition of the vice-president. He praised Osinbajo’s intellect and value, adding that he has the capacity to lead the country. “I have no doubt that he has the capacity to drive Nigeria’s hopes and dreams,” he said. “I have no worries about the vice-president’s ambition. I would like the people of Cross River state to carefully and attentively listen to him. “He is a man of great intellect and value and he came in to respectfully honour our Obong.” Also speaking, Osinbajo said he has the experience and sufficient knowledge to deal with the security and economic challenges facing the country. “The truth of the matter is that every country is faced with peculiar challenges – in our case, we are faced with security and economic challenges,” he said. “But we also know that God Himself equips us with all the necessary resources to defeat every challenge. “I believe very strongly that God helping us, our economic and security challenges will not only be dealt with, but will be stepping stones for a greater nation and a more prosperous and secured nation.”
