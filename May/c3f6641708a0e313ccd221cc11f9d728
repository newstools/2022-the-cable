The Nigerian consulate in New York says it has started installing machines to produce passports with 10-year validity for Nigerians. According to NAN, Lot Egopija, consul-general, spoke on Monday during a virtual town hall meeting with the Nigerian community in New York. Egopija said the consulate will soon start the issuance of the passports, adding that Nigerians will be informed when the process commences. “In the last meeting, we informed you that the enhanced 10-year passport process would soon come to New York,” he was quoted as saying. “The vice-consul in charge of immigration will inform you better when this will take off, but a team is already on the mission today. “To this end, we have expanded the second floor and it will be the hub of our activities. We are bringing all the biometrics machines to the same floor. “We have published NIN centres and those responsible should also inform the consulate so that we can pass the information to our nationals.” On her part, Mosunmola Onilede, the vice-consul in charge of immigration, said the consulate’s technical partner has started installing the machines for the production of the passports. “The process is on and the machines are in New York. The technical partners are working on the installation and once that is completed, it will be test-run,’’ she said.
