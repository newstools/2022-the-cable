Nasir el-Rufai, governor of Kaduna state, says “comprehensive, simultaneous” efforts by the security agencies can rid the north-west and north-central of terrorism. The governor said some communities in his state celebrated Eid-el-Fitr in fear due to the lingering security crisis. He spoke on Tuesday while the Emir of Zazzau, Ahmad Nuhu Bamalli, paid him a courtesy visit in Zaria. El-Rufai said the state government continues to seek support from federal security agencies to tackle the rising terrorist attacks. The governor said he is “convinced that comprehensive, simultaneous military and security operation in Kaduna, Katsina, Zamfara, Sokoto, Kebbi, Plateau and Niger states is vital to stopping the terrorists and reasserting the authority of the Nigerian state in the ungoverned spaces”. “Citizens in some of our communities fasted and worshipped amidst lingering fears and anxiety about their security. The Kaduna state government continues to do everything it can to mobilise and support the federal security agencies to defeat the terrorists and criminals that menace our people,’’ he added. “It is a matter of regret that the necessary follow up operations were not sustained by the security agencies. “We created a specialised Ministry of Internal Security, and we continue to support the federal security agencies with logistics and other resources. We are engaging the highest echelons of government and the security structure on resolute action to protect the lives, liberty and livelihoods of our people.” The governor said the criminal elements behind the unrest in the state are being assisted by a “network of informants” in many communities. He appealed to the traditional institutions to mobilise their networks to expose criminals and support the security forces with the necessary intelligence.
