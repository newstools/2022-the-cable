President Muhammadu Buhari has approved the immediate withdrawal of Nigeria from all international basketball competitions for the next two years. Sunday Dare, minister of youth and sports development, disclosed the development in a statement issued on Thursday. The development comes amid crisis within the Nigeria Basketball Federation (NBBF). TheCable had reported in January that two different presidents were elected to oversee the affairs of the federation. Speaking on the decision to withdraw Nigeria, Dare said the president took the stance as part of efforts by the federal government to revamp the sport from the grassroots. “Government intends to utilise this period of break to address contentious issues among stakeholders,” the statement reads. “The Terms of Reference (TOR) and membership of the Interim Management Committee will be announced in due course.” Ismaila Abubakar, permanent secretary of the ministry, who read the minister’s statement at a media briefing, said the issuance of the presidential order became imperative to show government’s interest and commitment to the development of basketball in the country. He said it will aid the development of talents among youths in an atmosphere that is free of rancour and squabbles, adding that there will be “revival of the domestic leagues which have become moribund”. According to Abubakar, the withdrawal will also allow for the setting up of an interim management committee (IMC) to oversee the development of domestic basketball leagues in Nigeria, and to further address related issues around the advancement of the game in the country. He called on players, officials, fans, and other stakeholders in basketball to remain calm, while government “embarks on far-reaching initiatives to reposition, sustain and stabilise the game of basketball for growth and success in the long-term interest of the country”.
