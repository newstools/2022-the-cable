The Ogun state government says it has sealed off the Sonata Agri Limited, a cashew nut processing company located along the Lagos-Ibadan expressway, over activities relating to alleged pollution of the environment. Ola Oresanya, special adviser to the Ogun governor on environment, said the shutdown came after numerous warnings were sent to the company. Oresanya said prior to the sealing of the company on Saturday, they had been asked to make efforts to address the pollution of the environment, but the previous warnings were ignored. “In the case of this company, we actually gave them a stop-work order when we discovered the reckless soot emanating from their power plants,” he said. “We then invited them, directed them on what to do, but they remained recalcitrant. So, we sealed the company because of the risk their continued operations will have on people living around the company, especially children and pregnant women, due to fumes from these plants. “Also, the release of waste-water from their steaming machines during the clean-in-place into drainages equally posed another serious threat to the environment which the state government will not tolerate. “This is a state that prides itself as an agrarian state, and as highly industrialised as we are, we don’t joke with air quality of the environment because we want to make the state as liveable as possible for residents.” Oresanya cautioned other companies to avoid polluting the environment, adding that the lives of the people are important to the state government.
