Flying Eagles of Nigeria have qualified for the semi-final of the ongoing WAFU-B U-20 Championship in Niamey, Niger Republic. The Ladan Bosso-led boys fashioned out a 2-2 draw against Burkina Faso on Wednesday at the General Seyni Kountche Stadium to complement the three points gathered against Ghana on Sunday. It was the Flying Eagles’ final game in the group, and they displayed resolve to finish strong and progress to the penultimate stage of the competition. Ibrahim Muhammad put the Eagles in front in the 24th minute after the Burkina Faso goalkeeper miscalculated a floating cross from the young striker. The ball had rustled his net before he could react adequately. But Junior Etalons rallied back Burkina Faso and equalised from the penalty spot. Ibrahim Yahaya returned Nigeria to the lead from the penalty spot in the 69th minute, but Burkinabé found another equaliser in the final 10 minutes of the game to make it 2-2. With four points from the group, the Eagles secured a berth in the semi-finals of the regional competition. In Group A, the Baby Elephants of Cote D’Ivoire have also qualified for the semi-finals after beating Togo 2-0, while Niger could only manage a goalless draw with the Benin Republic. The top two teams from each group will progress to the semi-finals, while only the two finalists will qualify for the Under-20 AFCON in Egypt billed for February 18, 2023, to March 12, 2023. The top four teams from the championship will qualify for the FIFA U20 World Cup held in Indonesia later that same year.
