Jose Mourinho’s Roma became the first team to win the maiden edition of the UEFA Europa Conference League (UECL) following a 1-0 win over Feyenoord at the National Arena in Tirana, Albania on Wednesday night. The historic first-ever UECL final was decided by Nikolo Zaniolo’s first-half goal on a night Mourinho became the first-ever coach to win all UEFA club competition trophies. The 59-year-old Portuguese coach, who maintained his winning record in European finals, had previously won the UEFA Champions League and Europa League titles. The UECL title is also Roma’s first-ever major European title in 50 years. Cyriel Dessers, Super Eagles of Nigeria forward, played all 90 minutes but could not find the back of the net for his Dutch club. Following a cagey start to the encounter, Roma took the lead in the 32nd minute through Zaniolo, as the Italian attacker reacted first to a Gianluca Mancini’s cross which was misjudged by a Feyenoord defender before flicking it beyond the goalkeeper. Feyenoord came out attacking at the start of the second half, hitting the bar twice in quick succession with Rui Patricio, Roma goalkeeper, denying the Rotterdam club on several occasions. Roma held on in the latter stages to secure their first trophy in 14 years since winning the Coppa Italia in 2008.
