The Bala Mohammed Campaign Organisation says if the Bauchi governor loses the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) presidential primary election, he will support whoever the party nominates. In a statement on Sunday, Udenta Udenta, spokesman of the campaign organisation, said Mohammed is only in the race because he wants to give back to society. “Many things stand out boldly in Bala Mohammed’s speeches meeting stop after meeting stop, his love and passion for Nigeria and the PDP, his desire to give back to society through selfless service, his humility about maybe not being the best in Nigeria but is surely among the best, and his credo that if he doesn’t win the primary election he will support wholeheartedly whosoever the party nominates,” the spokesman said. Udenta said Mohammed’s “Nigeria First Agenda” would address the country’s security challenges and resuscitate the country’s economy. “Bala Mohammed’s Nigeria First agenda is taking the nation by storm from one consultative meeting with delegates to another as he traverses the country and unleashes a rare passion for service that is as uncommon as it is peerless,” he said. “Constructed at political meetings with critical stakeholders, Bala Mohammed has thus far taken his uniquely developed vision agenda of carefully packaged policy documents on inclusive governance, binding the wounds of division in the land, combating security challenges, national reconstruction and economic resuscitation to Bayelsa, Delta, Edo, Cross River, Benue, Abia, Ondo, Ekiti, Osun, Lagos, Oyo and Ogun states.” “This is apart from his broad based strategic reach out to formidable impact players in Jigawa, Kano, Sokoto, Kaduna and Katsina states.” The governor had said he would drop his presidential bid if former President Goodluck Jonathan is nominated by the party.
