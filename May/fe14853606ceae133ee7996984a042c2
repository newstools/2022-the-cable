A new video of some passengers abducted by gunmen during the Abuja-Kaduna train attack has been released. In the short clip, six passengers, including a Pakistani, were seen sitting and kneeling in front of the camera with a gun-wielding man in green balaclava marshalling them. According to Arise TV, the footage was recently shot in the den of the kidnappers. A couple of victims who spoke appealed to the federal government to heed the demands of their abductors to aid their release. Mohammed, the Pakistani, urged both the Nigerian government and the authorities of his home country to come to the victims’ aid. “My name is Mohammed, I’m working here in Nigeria, but a foreign national, a Pakistani. We were abducted from the Abuja-Kaduna train on 28 March. We are here; 62 in number,” he said. “The conditions are not very good. I am appealing to the government of Nigeria; the government of Pakistan and the international community to help us.” An unnamed victim in hijab reiterated the plea amid tears, adding that she is in captivity alongside her family. “We are pleading with anybody who is in any position to assist us to please come to our aid — and give our abductors their demand so they can let us go. I’m here with my entire family.
