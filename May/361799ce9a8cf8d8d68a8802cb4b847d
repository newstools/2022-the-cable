Gbenga Olawepo-Hashim, a presidential hopeful on the platform of the All Progressives Congress (APC), has withdrawn from the race. In a statement on Friday, Olawepo-Hashim said he pulled out of the race in “national interest”. The presidential hopeful also said he hopes that the ruling party finds a suitable candidate ahead of the 2023 polls. “Certain developments have necessitated my withdrawal from the 2023 presidential race, as a result of which I did not pick the nomination form,” he said. “[I’m] retreating not out of the lack of will to fight for our resolve and collective aspiration for a New Nigeria, a struggle which has attracted enormous support. Sometimes will and resolve, energy and preparation may not be enough to engage in an encounter.” “My aspiration is not an ambition but an historic burden. My current political pursuit must now bow to our collective national interest. It is not about me but about Nigeria. “I stepped aside believing that another day would come. I hope our party will still be able to find a candidate for the 2023 election that will unite and secure our country; one that will lead an inclusive government, and build a prosperous economy that will not leave anyone behind. “I leave the race believing that by the Grace of God, my own day will come.” APC closed its sale of expression of interest and nomination forms on Thursday.
