Aishatu Binani, the senator representing Adamawa Central, has won the All Progressives Congress (APC) governorship primary in the state. The senator defeated Nuhu Ribadu, former chairman of the Economic and Financial Crimes Commission (EFCC), and Jibrilla Bindow, former governor of the state, to emerge the winner of the race. Binani was the only female in the contest for the governorship ticket of the party. Although the exercise took place on Thursday, she was declared the winner on Friday morning in Yola, the state capital. Binani polled 430 votes to beat Bindow who had 103 votes and Ribadu, who secured 288 votes. Courtesy of the victory, the senator will face Ahmadu Fintiri, the incumbent governor of the state, in the 2023 gubernatorial election Fintiri is seeking a second term in office, after clinching the ticket of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) on Wednesday. Binani’s feat makes her only the second female flag bearer of a major political party in Nigeria. Aisha Alhassan, the late former minister of women affairs, was the first to tow the path. She was the candidate of the APC in the Taraba state governorship election in 2015. Although she lost the election to Ishaku Darius, she challenged his victory at the court of appeal and supreme court — but lost her case.
