Nyesom Wike, governor of Rivers and presidential hopeful on the platform of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP), says the current state of affairs in the country requires urgent solutions. He spoke on Wednesday when he met with PDP delegates in Kogi state on his presidential ambition. Wike, who expressed concern over the security challenges, said with the current situation, it will take a mad person to make things better. “Where are we today in this country? This country has never been divided the way it is divided now,” he said. “I was in Katsina state yesterday and people were saying ‘the president is from Katsina; our own son is the president, yet so much insecurity in Katsina state’. “So, it doesn’t matter now where you come from. What matters is who is going to do this work. Look at the killings in Katsina, that even made the governor of that state, my friend, governor Masari, say ‘look everybody take up arms and defend yourself’. “That is the president’s state and he cannot protect his people. So, what Nigeria requires now — it doesn’t matter whether you’re from the north, east, west or south — is who can bail out Nigeria now. Who is that person that has the courage? Who is that fearless leader that can say what is black is black and what is white is white? “Some people say ‘don’t mind him, he’s a mad man’. I agree. What is the situation of Nigeria? Nigeria is a mad state. It requires a mad man to treat a mad man.” Wike also said he will remain in the PDP even if he fails to win the presidential primary, adding that his commitment to the party remains unshakeable. “My relationship is PDP; my love is PDP; my food is PDP; my sleep is PDP; everything is PDP. Every gang-up, I will quash them, except there is no God,” he added.
