Sagir Mai Iyali, chairman of a coalition supporting the presidential bid of Yemi Osinbajo, says the vice-president will deliver good governance if elected into office. Speaking with journalists in Kano on Monday, Iyali said Osinbajo has the capacity to govern because “he has been in the leadership struggle for the past eight years serving in a very challenging capacity”. The chairman said every Nigerian could attest to the fact that the vice-president is “articulate and agile”. “We are confident of his ability and capacity to deliver. He is a personality of no mean repute and a high flying academic excellence. He has been in the leadership struggle for the past eight years serving in a very challenging capacity,” he said. “Every discerning Nigerian can attest to the fact that he is articulate, agile, up and doing. “It is high time for every right thinking Nigerian to sift the grain from the chaff in voting credible politicians to power. “We are in a very challenging situation in which we must strive to elect leaders with untainted credibility. We have no reason to elect mediocres to coveted positions of authority.” In a letter dated May 17, Sagir asked the party to disqualify Tinubu over alleged false documents he tendered to the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) in 1998. Iyali said though Tinubu is above the required age to contest the office of president, his age is not known, adding that obscurity surrounding the presidential hopeful could jeopardise the party’s chances at the polls. ”We therefore urge the screening committee to invoke the powers vested on it by the constitution and guidelines of the party to disqualify Asiwaju Bola Ahmed Tinubu from taking part in the APC primary election for the presidential election,” he had said in the letter.
