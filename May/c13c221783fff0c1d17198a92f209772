The Economic and Financial Crimes Commission (EFCC) has arraigned Rochas Okorocha, former Imo state governor, before a federal high court in Abuja on allegations of fraud. Okorocha was arraigned alongside Anyim Chinenye, a chieftain of the All Progressives (APC) and five companies — Naphtali International Limited, Perfect Finish Multi Projects Limited, Consolid Projects Consulting Limited, Pramif International Limited, and Legend World Concepts Limited. The defendants who mounted the dock around 9:35 am pleaded not guilty to a 17-count money laundering charge. “I understand the charge against me, but I am not guilty, My Lord,” Okorocha said. Okorocha, who is currently the senator representing Imo West, had declared his intention to run for president in the 2023 elections. He was arrested by operatives of the EFCC last Tuesday. The arrest followed an alleged refusal by the former governor to make himself available for trial. The EFCC accused him of deliberately evading service of the charge. Following the plea of the defendants, Okey Amaechi, Okorocha’s lawyer, prayed the court to grant bail to his client pending the determination of the case. He drew the attention of the court to the fact that his client was forcefully arrested before APC’s presidential screening. “My Lord, without a warrant of arrest from this court, they went into the house of the defendant, broke into it and arrested him in a gestapo manner,” he said. However, Gbolahan Latona, EFCC counsel, told the court that Okorocha raised some issues in his bail application that he would want to file a response to. Inyang Ekwo, the judge, fixed Tuesday to hear the bail applications of the defendants. He also ordered that they should remain in EFCC custody, pending the determination of their bail request. The court also fixed November 7, 8, 9, 10 and 11 for trial.
