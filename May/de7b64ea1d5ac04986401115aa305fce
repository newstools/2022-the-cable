Ahmed Yerima, former Zamfara state governor, says he has received the go-ahead from President Muhammadu Buhari to join the race for the presidential ticket of the All Progressives Congress (APC). He made the disclosure after he met with Buhari on Friday at the presidential villa. Speaking with state house correspondents, Yerima said he visited Buhari to seek his blessing to contest for the presidential ticket of the ruling party. The former governor said if he is elected president, he would fight insecurity, poverty and ignorance. He said: “I’m here this afternoon to inform Mr. President of my intention to participate in the 2023 elections and to contest the office of the president of the Federal Republic of Nigeria. “I’m going to, Insha Allah, purchase my forms today and officially declare this afternoon. “So, I have three points as well; to fight insecurity, fight poverty and ignorance.” Yerima, who once represented Zamfara West in the senate, is famous for introducing Sharia law in Zamfara during his tenure as governor. The former governor joins a growing list of presidential hopefuls in the ruling party. They include Vice-President Yemi Osinbajo; Bola Tinubu, former Lagos governor; Rotimi Amaechi, minister of transportation; Dave Umahi, Ebonyi state governor; Rochas Okorocha, former governor of Imo; Yahaya Bello, governor of Kogi state; Emeka Nwajiuba, minister of state for education. Others are Kayode Fayemi, Ekiti state governor; Godswill Akpabio, minister of Niger Delta, and Chris Ngige, minister of labour and employment.
