Peter Obi, former governor of Anambra, says he is not “desperate” to become Nigeria’s president. Obi spoke on Friday during an interview with Channels Television. The former governor had, on Thursday, resigned his membership of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP). On Friday, Obi announced his decision to join the Labour Party, saying the party is a route to make Nigeria a production country. Reacting to the claim that he left the PDP because he cannot win the primary, the former governor said he is only “desperate” to make the country work, especially for the benefits of youths. “I’m not desperate to be president. I’m desperate to see Nigeria work, especially for the youths of this country,” he said. Asked if the PDP is not the right vehicle for him to achieve his goal, Obi said he moved to a party with a process that aligns with his interests. “Like I have said, I have left. I have moved on to where I think the process might allow me. It is not about winning or losing,” he said. “I will rather lose doing the right thing than win doing the wrong thing. My politics have been consistent in character and integrity throughout the time I started. You can go and check. “This is not the first time I left PDP. In 2002, when I started politics, I was a member of PDP. I went to one meeting and I wanted to contribute and some of the people said I can’t contribute. I quietly left and went to APGA, campaigned and won the election.”
