Relatives of passengers abducted during the attack on an Abuja-Kaduna train have appealed to the federal government to intensify rescue efforts. On March 28, a Kaduna-bound train was attacked by gunmen, leading to the deaths, injuries and abduction of several passengers. Abdulfatai Jimoh, a representative of the relatives of the abductees, in an interview on Tuesday, lamented the trauma experienced over the incident. “It has been a very traumatic experience for us. It’s almost two months that our loved ones have been held hostage in the forest. We have women, children, elderly ones and even those on special medication because of health challenges,” NAN quoted him as saying. “So, you can imagine them living in fear in the forest under the sun and the rain without any care. You can imagine the mental, psychological and physical trauma they will be going through. “We appeal to the federal government and all relevant agencies to expedite action and make sure all our loved ones are rescued. “The abductors say the federal government knows what they want. So, government should do the needful and let us have our families back.” Jimoh added that there should be regular and daily briefings by relevant government agencies on latest rescue efforts, adding that family members would use every legitimate means to ensure the release of their loved ones. He also urged Nigerians to continue to pray for the safe return of the victims, and all other persons in the hands of abductors.
