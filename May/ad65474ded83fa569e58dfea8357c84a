Aisha Buhari, first lady, on Monday, visited the national secretariat of the All Progressives Congress (APC) in Abuja. Dolapo, wife of Vice-President Yemi Osinbajo, was also in attendance. The first lady held a meeting with Abdullahi Adamu, APC national chairman, behind closed doors. Speaking with journalists after the meeting, Aisha said she was at the secretariat to congratulate the new national working committee (NWC) of the party, and to also seek the party’s support for women in the forthcoming general election. “We are also here to seek support for women. They should not be forgotten by the party,” she said. Also present during the visit were Pauline Tallen, minister of women affairs, as well as Iyiola Omisore, Betta Edu, and Dayo Israel, APC national secretary, women leader, and youth leader, respectively.
