Manchester United have announced Ralf Rangnick will not be staying at the club as a consultant — despite his previous agreement. The Red Devils broke the news in a statement on Sunday. The German gaffer, who took interim charge of United from December to May, was expected to stay at Old Trafford for a further two years in his new role as a consultant. But in the statement, United thanked Rangnick, 63, for his efforts as interim manager over the past six months. The Red Devils quoted Rangnick as saying he is leaving due to the demands of his new role as Austria coach. “By mutual agreement, Ralf will now focus solely on his new role as manager of the Austria national team and will not therefore be taking up a consultancy role at Old Trafford,” it read. “We would like to wish Ralf the best of luck in this next chapter of his career.” Rangnick oversaw the club’s worst points tally in the Premier League era as they finished sixth. He was also instrumental in the search and appointment of Erik ten Hag as United coach. He will now take charge of Austria for their upcoming Nations League fixtures, as they face Croatia, Denmark, and France in group A.
