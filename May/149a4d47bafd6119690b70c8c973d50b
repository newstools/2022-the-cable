The Lagos government has announced a “total ban” on the operations of commercial motorcycles in six LGAs in the state. Babajide Sanwo-Olu, governor of Lagos, announced the directive while briefing the state’s security agents on Wednesday. Local government areas affected by the ban include Ikeja, Surulere, Eti Osa, Lagos Mainland, Lagos Island and Apapa. The governor said the ban is to take effect from June 1, adding that “we want all commercial motorcycles completely off all major roads”. “A total ban from all the highways in these LGAs and is effective from June 1. This is the phase of banning that we are going to be embarking on so that others know that, within a short while, they either get out or go look for something else to do,” the governor said. “And from June 1, we are going to list all the LCDAs under these LGAs and publish them. So we are giving the notice now. So everyone can come up with strategies to achieve this. As from June 1, we want all commercial motorcycles completely off all major roads.” The ban comes just days after some commercial motorcyclists lynched a sound engineer identified as David Imoh in the Lekki axis of Lagos state. A misunderstanding over N100 balance was said to have degenerated, resulting in some motorcyclists present at the scene joining their colleague to beat up David and two of his friends. The commercial motorcyclists were said to have set the deceased ablaze after beating him unconscious. Benjamin Hundeyin, Lagos police spokesperson, said four suspects have been arrested in connection with the murder of the sound engineer.
