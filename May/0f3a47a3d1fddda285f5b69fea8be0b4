Biodun Oyebanji, governorship candidate of the All Progressives Congress (APC) in Ekiti, says his administration will ensure 35 percent women inclusion if he is elected as governor of the state. Oyebanji said this on Friday while receiving a delegation from the National Democratic Institute (NDI). He said the present administration in the state had laid the foundation to allow for the policy on the 35 percent inclusion to be achievable. “I’m committed to having women in places of responsibilities,” Oyebanji said. “We are looking at the possibility of having more women in the house of assembly without violating any political law. “Don’t cast aspersions on women who have shown interest in politics. Most of these reforms we have put in place, we want to push it to logical implementation. “I place so much value on women. I don’t think I will be what I am today without my wife.” The NDI delegation had earlier requested that the incoming administration scale up the Ekiti women agenda, and maintain the momentum of activities to curb gender-based violence (GBV). The delegation had also requested that the APC candidate commit to ensuring peaceful election. Responding, Oyebanji said it is only peace that can ensure meaningful development, adding that “it’s also important to look at the root cause of violence, which is poverty.” He also said part of his first agenda when he comes into power is to ensure youth development in order to make the youths more productive.
