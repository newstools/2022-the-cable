Kayode Fayemi, Ekiti governor and presidential hopeful, says if he is elected president, he would address the “imbalance” in the federal capital territory (FCT). Speaking at a meeting with FCT All Progressives Congress (APC) delegates on Tuesday, Fayemi said he would ensure that the indigenous people of Abuja are well represented in government. “My government will address this imbalance and revert to the original number of LGAs which gave the indigenes effective representation,” he said. “We shall also build on the gains of the security architecture put in place by the Buhari administration. Many are quick to forget how the FCT became a hotbed of violence and frequent bombings between 2012 and 2015. “Many may have forgotten the UN House bomb incident, the Banex bomb incident and several incidents of terrorism. “We appreciate how far we have gone, but we shall address the gaps noticed, introduce intelligence, technology, retool the armed forces and bring to bear my expertise in security consultancy around the world by bringing innovations that will ensure that the FCT becomes a fortress and the safest place to live, work and do business.” The Ekiti governor said he is focused on ensuring that there is peace in the country. “I’m here to offer myself as a servant leader. I’ll work for the people, fair to everyone, just, equitable, courageous and heal the wounds of years of division by offering inclusiveness and giving everyone a sense of belonging,” he said. “I will end banditry and all pockets of disagreements in the country. “My focus would be on bringing peace to my fatherland and ensuring that the Ibadan man finds home in Sokoto and the Sokoto man finds home in Akure, Abakaliki, Onisha or Owerri. The Owerri man must find a home in Damaturu. This is the Nigeria I want to fight for and I’m confident it’s achievable.”
