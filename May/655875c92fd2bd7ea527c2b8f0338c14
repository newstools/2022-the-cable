Mohammed Hayatu-Deen, a former managing director of the now-defunct FSB International Bank and presidential hopeful, says he wants to make life better for Nigerians. He said this over the weekend during an interaction with delegates of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) in Kaduna. Hayatu-Deen had, in March, announced his intention to contest the presidency on the platform of the PDP. Speaking on his ambition, the former Bank MD also advised delegates against voting with emotions. “I make a solemn pledge that if I have your votes, I will keep my promise to do everything to work for Nigeria and the Nigerian people,” he said. On his part, Ahmed Makarfi, former governor of Kaduna, described Hayatu-Deen as one of the party’s leading presidential aspirants who is dedicated to making Nigeria better. “He is a dedicated and a balanced person who carries Nigeria in his heart and I know he will do well,” Makarfi said. “In assessing him, his pedigree speaks for itself. I am sure the coordinators will do well for him and Kaduna state. We will do everything for PDP’s success.” In his remarks, Felix Hyat, Kaduna PDP chairman, said the party members in the state are aware of Hayatu-Deen’s qualifications and why he is fit to contest. “He is a sound, knowledgeable leader who has achieved a lot. We join our leader, his excellency, senator Ahmed Makarfi, in recognising your dexterity and success. If you have succeeded in your businesses, you will succeed in leading the country,” Hyat said. “He that is faithful in little will be faithful in much. We join your supporters and well-wishers to pray that God gives you to us as the leader of our nation.” In his remarks, former Vice-President Namadi Sambo said he has known Hayatu-Deen since his days at the New Nigeria Development Corporation, adding that the nation would benefit from his diligence and dedication if he gets the opportunity to serve at the highest level.
