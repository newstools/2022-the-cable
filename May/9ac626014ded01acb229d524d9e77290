Bola Tinubu, former Lagos governor seeking the presidential ticket of the All Progressives Congress (APC), says if he becomes president, he can make Edo state as “beautiful” as Lagos. He said this on Saturday at a meeting with APC delegates in Edo state, ahead of the party’s presidential primary. Present during the meeting were Adams Oshiomhole, former national chairman of the APC, and Ize Iyamu, candidate of the party in the 2020 Edo governorship election. Speaking on his plans for the state, Tinubu, who said he wouldn’t be able to stay at the meeting for as long as he’d prefer, added he will ensure that the APC wins the next governorship election. “I’ll deliver my message through Adam and the message will not disappoint you. We are still going to fight further. Don’t worry. We are with you. You will not walk alone,” he said. “I have to rush back for the good of us all. It’s either I come back another day or we wait until you come to Abuja. “I am going to do our job, in our interest, for the sake of all of us, our country and for the benefit and prosperity of all of us. “Nobody can supercede the work of the Almighty; you cannot be superior to the work of God. “One thing I can assure you is this: Do you want Edo back? As the president of the Federal Republic of Nigeria, I will give Edo back to you. Edo will turn to a beautiful [state] — if not more beautiful — [and] will be equal to Lagos. Be assured of that.”
