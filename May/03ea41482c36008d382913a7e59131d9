Tukur Buratai, former chief of army staff and current ambassador of Nigeria to Benin Republic, says he believes there will be establishment of more military bases to help tackle security challenges in the country. Buratai, who was earlier conferred with the title of Jagunmolu of Sakiland in Oyo, said this on Saturday while unveiling a road and school gate named after him at the Command Science Secondary School in Saki, Oyo state. He said there is a need for combined efforts to have a strong and committed institution that will protect the territories of the nation. “In this era of terrorism, insurgency, asymmetric warfare, there is a need to spread the security agencies to take care of many volatile areas that need quick interventions,” NAN quoted him as saying. “I foresee establishment of more military bases in the nearest future. “Combined efforts will enable us to have a strong and committed institution that will protect our territory.”. Buratai commended Gold Chibuisi, general commanding officer (GOC), 2 division, Nigerian Army, for his contributions to the development of the Command Science Secondary School in Saki. The former army chief also appreciated Khalid Oyedepo, the Okere of Saki, the Saki community and the Oyo state government for the support given to him while in military service, as well as to the school. He said the school, formerly a teachers’ college, was donated to the army, adding that significant positive development had been recorded in the school. In his remarks, Chibuisi, who described Buratai as his mentor, said the division remains committed to sustaining and improving on efforts to develop the school. The GOC also commended the Saki community for the provision of a conducive environment for the school, and urged them to sustain the peaceful atmosphere with the officers of the command.
