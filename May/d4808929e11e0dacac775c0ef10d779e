Ali Makoda, chief of staff to Abdullahi Ganduje, governor of Kano state, has defected from the All Progressives Congress (APC) to the New Nigeria Peoples Party (NNPP). Ganduje appointed Makoda chief of staff in 2019. Makoda had previously served as the commissioner for environment. In April, he tendered his resignation as chief of staff, but Ganduje rejected his letter. He was said to have joined NNPP on Friday night after a meeting with Rabiu Kwankwaso, former governor of the state. Kwankwaso is also a presidential hopeful on the platform of the New Nigeria People’s Party (NNPP). Kwankwaso was said to have received Makoda and other defectors at his Miller road residence in Kano.
