Chukwujekwu Uzozie, a businessman and farmer who resides in Ukpor, Nnewi LGA of Anambra, has been abducted by gunmen. Uzozie’s son was also shot when their home was invaded by gunmen in the early hours of Saturday. A family source, who didn’t want to be named, told NAN that there has not been any contact with the abductors. The relative also said Uzozie’s son is currently receiving treatment at a hospital. The source added that Uzozie served as special adviser to a former chairman of Nnewi south local government council. According to the relative, members of St. Andrew’s Church in Nnewi, which Uzozie attends, have organised special prayers for his safe return and the quick recovery of his son. Tochukwu Ikenga, police spokesperson in Anambra, confirmed the incident. Ikenga added that a manhunt is ongoing for the abductors. The development comes amid attacks by gunmen in the area in recent months. Aside from attacks leading to the killing and abduction of residents, security operatives have also been the target of some of such incidents. In October 2021, gunmen razed the operational base of the Department of State Services (DSS) in the area.
