Hakeem Jamiu, deputy speaker of the Ekiti house of assembly, has won the ticket of the All Progressives Congress (APC) to seek another term as a lawmaker. Jamiu currently represents the Irepodun/Ifelodun state constituency in the house of assembly. The lawmaker won the ticket on Thursday after defeating Kayode Ojo, a house of assembly hopeful. The deputy speaker secured the ticket after polling 18 votes — Ojo came close but was only able to secure 12 votes. Thereafter, Kayode Fasae, chairman of the primary election committee, declared Jamiu the winner of the exercise. “Hakeem Jamiu, having scored the highest number of votes, is hereby declared winner of the primary election,” Fasae said. In his acceptance speech, Jamiu thanked the delegates for the confidence they have in him. He also asked Ojo to work with him to ensure the victory of the APC in the governorship election scheduled for June 2022.
