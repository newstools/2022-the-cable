Udom Emmanuel, a presidential hopeful on the platform of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP), says he will work with anyone the party elects as its candidate for 2023. The Akwa Ibom governor spoke on Friday when he met the party’s delegates in Benue state. Emmanuel said he joined the presidential race because he has “what it takes” to turn the country around. ‘’I’m running for the presidency because things have really gone bad and l have what it takes to salvage the situation for the sake of posterity,” he said. “Mine is not a do or die affair. If it is the will of God, I am ready and willing and capable to take up the challenge. If God chooses me, I am ready to partner with him. If he says it is someone one, I am ready to accept and work with God’s choice.” Emmanuel said the economic and security situation in the country “have really gone bad”,  adding that it is “imperative to rescue the sinking ship of Nigeria and Nigerians”. “Things cannot just continue like this, therefore, I offer myself to serve,” the governor added. In his remarks, Samuel Ortom, governor of Benue, said Emmanuel is “one of the few people” who have shown concern about the plight of residents in the state. “Benue has been under siege for a long time and very few people have shown concern and support,” Ortom said. “As Buhari and APC said that they will take Nigeria from top to bottom, we are not only at the bottom now but beneath the bottom. We have been down in all spheres of life. “We cannot continue like this. I believe the least of the PDP aspirants is better than the best in APC. We must pray but also we must take action. Your coming forward to offer yourself is the right step in the right direction.”
