Shamsudeen Dosunmu, a governorship hopeful on the platform of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP), has resigned his membership of the party. Dosunmu announced his intention to leave the PDP in a letter addressed to the Lagos state chairman of the party. The governorship hopeful said he has been a member of the party for about 23 years, but said with recent developments, his ideals and that of the PDP no longer align. “I am writing to inform you of my resignation from the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) with effect from today, Thursday 26th May, 2022,” the letter reads. “A copy of this letter has been conveyed to the Chairman of Ward ‘B’ Apapa Local Government, Lagos State. “The past 23years I have spent as a member of this party had been interesting until recently when I realised that my ideals are no longer aligning with what obtains in the party. “I hereby thank you personally for your sincerity and disposition towards upholding the constitution of the party despite all odds.” Meanwhile, his resignation from the party comes hours after he pulled out of the PDP governorship primary in Lagos state. Dosunmu had announced his withdrawal from the governorship primary which was held on Wednesday, citing “anomaly” in the delegates’ list used for the election.
