A Lagos high court sitting at the Tafawa Balewa Square has convicted Peter Nielsen, a Danish national, for killing his wife and daughter. The state government had, on June 13, 2018, arraigned Nielsen before the court on a two-count charge of murder — the offence is contrary to section 223 of the Criminal Laws of Lagos, 2015. He was said to have killed his wife, Zainab, also known by her stage name as Alizee, and his three-year-old daughter on April 5, 2018, at about 3.45 am at their Banana Island residence in the Ikoyi area of Lagos. The defendant, who had pleaded not guilty upon arraignment, had told the court while testifying that his wife and daughter died before a doctor arrived their home. Nielsen told the court that he woke up at 2:30 am on April 5, 2018, and got snacks and drinks for his wife and daughter before going back to sleep. The defendant said when he woke up at 7:30am and did not see his wife on their bed, he searched for her. Nielsen had also told the court he saw his wife and daughter in their kitchen, where he said he perceived a strong smell of gas when he opened the door. The defendant said he dragged his wife to the living room and asked one of the girls living with them to carry his daughter, adding that he then covered them with two blankets after he realised that they had died. Delivering judgment on Friday, Bolanle Okikiolu-Ighile, the presiding judge, found the defendant guilty of the murder. “I hereby pronounce that you Peter Nielsen shall be hanged by the neck until death. May God have mercy on you,” she said.
