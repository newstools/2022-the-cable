Olu Falae, former secretary to the government of the federation (SGF), has kicked against the calls for the zoning of the 2023 presidency to a particular region. Falae spoke when he received the newly-elected executives of the Ondo state chapter of the Social Democratic Party (SDP) in Akure. The newly-elected executives were led on the visit by Dele Thomas, SDP chairman. Falae, who is former national chairman of the SDP, said there is no provision for zoning in the Nigerian constitution. He also said zoning is not part of the conditions for Nigeria’s presidency, hence, it is not valid. “Politicians should stop deceiving the people by putting zoning in the party constitution, where it is not valid. Nigerian constitution supersedes party’s constitution,” he said. “There is no provision for zoning in the 1999 constitution of the Federal Republic of Nigeria. Zoning is not part of the conditions for Nigeria’s presidency. “If all aspirants accept it and they did not challenge it, it stands, but if a single aspirant challenges it, the Nigerian constitution will override what is in the party constitution.” The elder statesman, who announced his retirement from active politics in 2019, promised to reconcile all factions in the party. “l will never come back to partisan politics. l have paid my dues but I will continue to support you,” he said. “Whatever we can do to restore sanity to SDP, we will do it so that we can attain the heights we were. Nobody will benefit from the crisis. Crisis kills parties.”
