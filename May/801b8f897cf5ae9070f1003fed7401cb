The house of representatives has postponed the resumption of plenary. The last time the legislators held plenary session was on May 11, and they were scheduled to resume on May 24. But in a statement issued on Monday, Yahaya Danzariya, clerk of the house of representatives, said the resumption date has been shifted as a result of the ongoing party primaries. “I am directed to inform all Hon Members, Staff, Media and the General Public that due to the ongoing party primaries, the House will now resume plenary on Tuesday, 7th June, 2022 at 11:00 am,” the statement reads. Since returning from Easter recess in April, the legislators have had a staggered plenary. Danzariya had attributed the development to the renovation of the green chamber. Meanwhile, the lawmakers had recently passed a bill seeking to enable statutory delegates to vote at the conventions and congresses of political parties during an emergency plenary on May 11. Meanwhile, the legislators are expected to embark on their annual recess in June.
