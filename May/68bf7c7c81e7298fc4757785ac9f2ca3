Hope Uzodimma, governor of Imo, says the All Progressives Congress (APC) delegates will look favourably in the direction of Kayode Fayemi, Ekiti governor and presidential hopeful. Femi Ige, spokesman of the Fayemi campaign organisation, quoted the Imo governor as saying this when the Ekiti governor visited him in Owerri on Friday. Uzodimma described the chairman of the Nigeria Governors Forum (NGF) as a “terrific team player”. “His management of affairs of the NGF is a classic testimony to his renowned man management acumen. He’s a terrific team player, consensus builder, and brilliant leader. The conviction behind his words provokes you to want to listen more to the wisdom in his thoughts,” the Imo governor said. “To us in Imo, the giant strides which you are seeing in the state either in World Bank, AfDB or other international agency interventions are handiwork of President Muhammadu Buhari and Governor Fayemi. “So, my chairman, Imo is your home, we know there are many aspirants but when the time comes, we shall do what is expected of us and I can assure you that we will look favorably in your direction.” On his part, Fayemi said for Nigeria to make progress, citizens must be given a sense of belonging. “To get out of the woods, our nation must heal wounds, ensure inclusiveness and foist an administration that gives everybody a sense of belonging that will encourage our brothers and sisters in the south-east unleash the inner kinetic energy inherent in them for the greatness of the greater Nigeria Nation instead of engendering in them the urge to quit the union,” he said.
