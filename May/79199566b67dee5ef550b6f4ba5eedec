The police have reportedly deployed its personnel in the secretariat of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) in Umuahia, the capital of Abia state. The development is said to have caused confusion around the state’s PDP office and among party members. Movement to and from the secretariat, which is located on Finbars road, Umuahia, is reportedly restricted by police officers. TheCable has not immediately confirmed why the police deployed its personnel in the PDP secretariat. Geoffrey Ogbonna, police public relations (PPRO) in Abia, is yet to respond to text messages seeking comment on the development. Fabian Nwankwo, PDP spokesperson in Abia, reportedly told party officials to take the day off. The development comes weeks after Onyema Ugochukwu, a member of the PDP board of trustees (BOT), warned of a potential crisis in the Abia chapter of the party. Ugochukwu had said the decision over the zoning of the governorship ticket of the PDP has “severely polarised the party”.
