A magistrate’s court sitting in Sokoto has remanded two suspects — Bilyaminu Aliyu and Aminu Hukunci — arrested in connection with the murder of Deborah Emmanuel, a female student of Shehu Shagari College of Education. BACKGROUND On May 12, Deborah was attacked by a mob and set ablaze over comments purportedly considered to be an insult to Prophet Mohammed. A video of the student being stoned and beaten with sticks was shared on social media. The incident sparked outrage and condemnation across the country and the police command in Sokoto, subsequently, arrested two suspects in connection with the killing. On Saturday, some residents protested against the arrest of the two suspects, which led to unrest in Sokoto — a development that led to the imposition of a 24-hour curfew by the state government. SUSPECTS PLEAD ‘NOT GUILTY’ On Monday, the police command in Sokoto arraigned Aliyu and Hukunci over alleged participation in the murder of the female student. During the court proceedings, the suspects pleaded not guilty to the murder of the deceased. According to NAN, Khalil Musa, the prosecuting inspector, told the court that the police are currently investigating the circumstances surrounding the incident. Mansur Ibrahim, the defence counsel who is leading a team of 34 lawyers for the case, applied for bail on behalf of the suspects, adding that the request was in line with constitutional provisions and sections of the Administration of Criminal Justice Law. But the trial judge (name withheld for security reasons) reserved ruling on the bail application and ordered the suspects to be remanded at a correctional centre.
