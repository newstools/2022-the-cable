Similarly, the Base intercepted a Market Boat at Odioma-Diema axis along Akassa- Brass route. “The boat was laden with over 3,500 litres of suspected crude oil products concealed in drums and gallons which were subsequently evacuated to a river bank and neutralized accordingly. “In a related development, it said NNS Delta in Warri on April 25 deactivated an iIlegal refining Ssite (IRS) around Sara creek in Warri south-west local government area. “A total of 30 refining units/ovens, 35 big metal storage tanks and 4 large pits cumulatively filled with about 500,000 litres of ilegally refined AGO and 700,000 litres of stolen crude oil were deactivated. “Also on 25 April 2022, NNS SOROH identified and proceeded to a newly reconstructed IRS off Otuofor creek in Sangana, Brass LGA. “The site had 2 refining ovens, 2 empty storage tanks and a large wooden boat containing about 100,000 litres of ilegally sourced crude oil. “These were all destroyed in situ. Thereafter, NNS SOROH searched adjoining creeks around Kotipiri fishing camp before proceeding to another IRS at Ereweibio creek, Sangana Brass LGA. It added that a total of 15 large pits, 10 ovens, 7 large metal storage tanks, drums and sacks all containing about 500,000 litres of ilegally sourced crude oil, 400,000 litres of ilegally refined AGO and 20,000 litres of ilegally refined kerosene were discovered and deactivated. “Additionally, one 40Hp Yamaha engine, One Power series 5,000 Watts generator and one Pumping machine were seized from the site,” it added. “Meanwhile, on 26 April 2022, NNS DeltaE at Sara creek in Warri SW LGA of Delta State discovered a total of 15 ilegal refining units/ovens, 18 metal storage tanks and 2 large pits all laden with a total of about 150,000 litres of ilegally refined AGO and 400,000 litres of stolen crude oil. “These were all crushed and destroyed. “On the same day, the Base intercepted one large wooden boat laden with about 200,000 Litres of stolen crude oil hidden in a creek around Ekpemu community in Warri North LGA. “Accordingly, the wooden boat and product were destroyed in situ while 2 pumping machines were seized. “Furthermore, on 30 April 2022, NNS Pathfinder in Port-Harcourt intercepted one wooden boat laden with unspecified quantity of ilegally refined AGO at Isaka junction. “The Base also conducted swamp buggy operations in Cawthorne channel and later intercepted 2 wooden boats laden with unspecified quantity of products suspected to be local ilegally refined AGO. “Similarly, Forward Operating Base (FOB) BONNY on the same day, intercepted a large ‘Cotonou’ wooden boat tied to a branch and ladened with about 300,000 litres of product suspected to be local ilegally refined AGO. “These were all neutralized appropriately. “On the same day, NNS DELTA located an IRS around Ogbodede community in Warri South LGA. The site had 2 ovens, 7 metal storage tanks and 10 large pits cumulatively laden with about 275,000 litres of stolen crude oil. “The criminals fled before the arrival of the naval patrol team. Nevertheless, the IRS was deactivated. “Further exploitation by the Base led to the discovery of an inactive IRS off Asisan creek in Warri South LGA. It was observed that the IRS was under construction with one oven already constructed. The site was subsequently destroyed. “In summary, Week 4 of OPDDB witnessed the recovery of over 2,178,500 litres (13,703 barrels) of stolen crude oil, about 787,500,000 litres of AGO and 20,000 litres of Kerosene all valued above N1.7 billion. “Pertinently, with respect to previous seizures and recoveries during OPDDB for the month of April 2022, the Nigerian Navy denied oil thieves and economic saboteurs an estimated N10,701,793,052.5 worth of crude oil and related products for the period under review.”
