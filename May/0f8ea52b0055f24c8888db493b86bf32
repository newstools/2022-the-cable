Niran Adedokun, the public relations practitioner and lawyer, on Sunday, had a reading and signing of his book titled, ‘The Law is an Ass’. The book reading was held at The Booksellers, Nurnberger Plaza, Abuja. The event was hosted by Folarin Mosuro, a member of The Booksellers, with Adedokun all chatty and reflective as he took the audience through the content of his book. Speaking with TheCable, Adedokun said ‘The Law is an Ass,’ which features nine short stories and has over 160 pages, is his third and first fiction book. The author disclosed that his love for writing inspired him to publish the book. “The law is an ass is my third book, but the other books are non-fiction,” Adedokun said. “I’ve always wanted to write fiction after I had done the two non-fiction books. I just felt like the next book I will do, let it be fiction and that was how I started getting the stories together. “I started writing when I was very young, but it wasn’t something that I took seriously, I used to just write and throw them away and then I left it for a while. “But by the time I got into the University of Ilorin, I was studying theatre and performing arts, then I discovered that I loved writing. So I joined the campus journalism club and by the time I graduated, I was sure that I wanted to be a journalist and a writer. “You should expect more books by the grace of God and they will be diverse books. I’m trusting God to help me to be able to do that.” <img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-702346" src="https://f5p3e9e4.stackpathcdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/IMG-20220523-WA0012.jpg" alt=""
