Muhammad Shehu-Baba, chairman of Keffi LGA in Nasarawa state who was abducted by gunmen, has regained his freedom. Tanimu Mohammed, his aide, also regained his freedom from the gunmen. Ramhan Nansel, state police spokesman, confirmed this to NAN on Sunday. The Keffi LGA chairman and his aide were kidnapped on Keffi-Akwanga road on Friday by armed men after they killed his police orderly, Alhassan Habib. The state commissioner of police was said to have deployed police personnel of the anti-kidnapping unit and police mobile force to the scene. The spokesman on Sunday said the abducted persons regained freedom around 9:00pm on Saturday and were reunited with their families. He also said three suspects were arrested around Gitata community of Keffi LGA in connection with the crime. “The suspects, who came from Kaduna state, were arrested while negotiating for ransom,” he added. Nansel, however, said the police are not aware of any ransom paid before their release.
