Real Madrid scored a second-half winner to pip Liverpool to the 2021/2022 UEFA Champions League title following a 1-0 win over Parc des Princes stadium in Paris on Saturday night. Vinicius Junior scored the only goal of the encounter to overcome the Anfield side who were favourites to lift the biggest trophy in continental club football. The win is also a record-extending 14th UCL title for Real Madrid who last won it in 2018 — also against Liverpool. Liverpool dominated the first half and went close through Sadio Mane and Mohamed Salah, but Thibaut Courtois, Real Madrid goalkeeper, repelled the relentless attack, brilliantly diverting Mane’s fierce shot from close range onto the post in the pick of the bunch. There was, however, controversy at the end of the half with the video assistant referee (VAR) technology ruling Karim Benzema’s goal out for offside in controversial circumstances. The Reds started the second period like the first but could not get past Courtois who was on hand to cut short Liverpool attacks before Real Madrid took the lead against the run of play on 59 minutes through Vinicius Jr. The Brazilian youngster was on hand to convert Federico Valverde’s low cross at the far post for a 1-0 lead. Liverpool revved up the pressure and continued to create chances but Jurgen Klopp’s men were undone by an on-form Courtois who made several saves to deny Trent Alexander-Arnold and Salah. Real Madrid, who have not lost to Liverpool in their last six meetings, made it seven with astute defending to claim their 14th UCL title. Carlo Ancelotti, Real Madrid coach, also became the manager with the highest number of UCL titles, following his fourth title and second as Real Madrid coach.
