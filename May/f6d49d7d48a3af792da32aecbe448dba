Cyril Desser netted his first goal as the Super Eagles of Nigeria lost 1-2 to Mexico in an international friendly game on Sunday. Jose Peseiro, the three-time African champions handler, also became the first Nigerian coach to lose a debut game in twenty-eight years — after Amodu Shaibu led the team to a respectable  1-0 loss to England at the old Wembley on November 16, 1994. In an enthralling game of two halves at the AT & T stadium in Arlington, Texas, Santiago Gimenez caught the Super Eagles defense napping to open scoring for the El Tri of Mexico in the 13th minute. The South American side continued their forage upfront and almost doubled their lead in the 18th minute. Francis Uzoho rose to the occasion to save the blushes of Nigeria in the 31st minute as Mexico kept on tormenting the Jose Peseiro’s side. The first forty-five minutes ended 1-0 in favour of the CONCACAF team. I’m the second half, the Eagles came out gun blazing, with Dessers netting the equaliser for Nigeria. Barely a minute after the Nigerian side leveled up, William Troost-Ekong gifted Mexico an own goal when he headed into his own net to put the opposition ahead again. The Super Eagles tried everything possible l to salvage a point from the game but all their efforts proved abortive as the game ended 2-1 in favour of Mexico. The Super Eagles will play the second tune up game ahead of the 2023 Africa Cup of Nations (AFCON) qualifiers against Ecuador on Tuesday in New Jersey.
