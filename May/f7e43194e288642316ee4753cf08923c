The All Progressives Congress (APC) has postponed the date for the screening of its presidential hopefuls. Felix Morka, national publicity secretary of the party, announced the development in a statement issued on Sunday. The screening exercise was scheduled to hold on May 23. However, Morka said a new date for the exercise “will be announced shortly”. The APC spokesman had, on May 19, said a total of 28 aspirants obtained forms to contest the presidency on the party’s platform, but three persons failed to submit their forms. He had listed the three persons as Chris Ngige, minister of labour; Godwin Emefiele, governor of the Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN); and Timipre Sylva, minister of state for petroleum resources. Ngige and Sylva were among ministers scheduled to resign their positions as directed by President Muhammadu Buhari in line with section 84(12) of the electoral act, which bars political appointees from participating in party primaries. A valedictory session presided over by Buhari had also been held for the ministers, with Ngige and Sylva in attendance. However, both ministers had resolved to continue in office. On his part, Emefiele had sought a court order allowing him to contest the presidency. However, while the matter is yet to be concluded in court, the APC deadline for the submission of forms ended on May 13. Other presidential hopefuls on the APC platform include Vice-President Yemi Osinbajo; Senate President Ahmad Lawan; Bola Tinubu; former Lagos governor; Rochas Okorocha, senator representing Imo west; Kayode Fayemi, Ekiti governor; and Yahaya Bello, governor of Kogi.
