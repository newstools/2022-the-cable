Chukwuemeka Nwajiuba, minister of state for education, has resigned from his position. His resignation was said to have been announced at the federal executive council (FEC) meeting presided over by President Muhammadu Buhari on Wednesday. Nwajiuba had, on April 27, announced his intention to run for president in the 2023 general election on the platform of the All Progressives Congress (APC) According to a source in the ministry, Nwajiuba had tendered his resignation since April 28 after announcing his intention to contest the presidency. “He actually resigned effective April 28th after accepting to run,” the source told TheCable. “The president approved his resignation upon resumption from the Eid break on May 3rd and then travelled out. “Nwajiuba left the announcement for the president to do as protocol demands. The president announced that resignation today at FEC before giving the order.” Earlier on Wednesday, the president had directed all ministers in his cabinet, who are interested in contesting in the 2023 elections, to resign. The president’s directive came amid controversy over section 84(12) of the Electoral Act 2022, which has now become a court matter. The aforementioned section states: “No political appointee at any level shall be a voting delegate or be voted for at the convention or congress of any political party for the purpose of the nomination of candidates for any election.” Ministers seeking elective positions in the current administration include Abubakar Malami, minister of justice and attorney-general of the federation; Chris Ngige, minister of labour; and Rotimi Amaechi, minister of transportation. While Malami is seeking to become governor of Kebbi, Amaechi and Ngige have announced their intentions to contest the presidency.
