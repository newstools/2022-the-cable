David Mark, chairman of the national convention organising committee of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP), has cautioned members of the committee against bias. According to a statement by Paul Mumeh, Mark’s media adviser, the former senate president spoke on Friday when he addressed members of the convention committee in Abuja. Mark, who said preparations have been made to ensure the exercise will be smooth, asked members of the committee to ensure a credible and transparent exercise. “You must be absolutely transparent. If you have any  interest or bias for any of the aspirants, you can excuse yourself from this assignment,” he said. Speaking on preparations for the exercise, he added that the party is prepared. “We are prepared for the exercise. Virtually all our delegates have arrived in Abuja,” he said. “The PDP has an array of eminently qualified persons to rule Nigeria. We carried out due diligence during our screening. I am confident that whoever emerges from the convention will reflect the wishes of our party.” It isn’t, however, clear if the party will postpone the presidential primary, considering the decision of the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) to postpone the deadline for the conduct of primaries by six days. INEC announced the decision to push the deadline forward on Friday.
