Rotimi Amaechi, presidential hopeful, says Yahaya Bello, Kogi governor and presidential hopeful, is entitled to run for president but he is more experienced than the governor. Speaking at a meeting with Kogi All Progressives Congress (APC) delegates in Lokoja on Friday, Amaechi said he would run an all inclusive government. “This is the 28th state that I have visited in the course of my consultations. I’m not one of the aspirants, I am the leading aspirant in the party,” the former transportation minister said. “I welcome my friend governor Bello who wants to run. He is a young man, he is entitled to run for the office of the President but I have more experience in governance and leadership roles than him. “I will carry everybody along. To appoint the Minister coming from Kogi, I will come to you people and allow you to nominate whom you want. The reason for that is to get everybody involved so that you can approach your minister and your minister will know that he is responsible to you. “Please don’t vote for anybody else, vote for me. As speaker, I was chairman of speakers’ forum, as governor, I was the chairman of governors’ forum twice, as DG of President Buhari Campaign, I managed everybody, I managed the campaign, that’s experience.” Responding, Edward Onoja, Kogi deputy governor, said God would give Nigeria a president that could secure the country. “No doubt, the next president of Nigeria will come to the table with physical and mental strength,” Onoja said. “We believe that God will give Nigeria the best product that can secure, unite and foster peace in the country. We appreciate that you even remembered to come to Kogi State. To have gone round 28 States, it shows stamina, it shows strength. We wish you well.”
