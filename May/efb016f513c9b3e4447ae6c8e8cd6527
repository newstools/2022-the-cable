Peter Obi, a former governor of Anambra and presidential hopeful, has joined the Labour Party. The former governor confirmed the development in a post on his Twitter handle on Friday. The development comes hours after Obi announced his resignation from the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP). The former governor had been scheduled to participate in the PDP presidential primary scheduled for May 28. However, in the resignation letter dated May 24, 2022, and addressed to Iyorchia Ayu, national chairman of the PDP, Obi said recent developments in the party do not support his continued membership of the PDP. Speaking on his decision to join the Labour Party, the presidential hopeful said the party aligns with the interest of Nigerians across different sectors. “I thank all Nigerians, especially our youths who have joined me in the mission of taking back and reuniting Nigeria. This project is yours and for the future of your children. I am just a facilitator,” he said. “Since I resigned from the PDP because of issues that are at variance with my persona and principles, I have consulted widely with various parties and personalities to ensure we do not complicate the route to our desired destination. “For me, the process of achieving our goal is as fundamental as what one will do thereafter. Therefore, I have chosen a route that I consider to be in line with our aspirations and my mantra of taking the country from consumption to production; and that is the Labour Party which is synonymous with the people, workers, development, production, securing and uniting Nigerians as one family. “I invite all Nigerians to join me in taking back our country. Be assured that I’ll never let you down.”
