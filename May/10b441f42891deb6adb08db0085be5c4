Ovie Omo-Agege, deputy president of the senate, has appointed Ima Niboro, former spokesman to ex-President Goodluck Jonathan, to lead the communications and media strategy initiative for his campaign organisation. On April 14, Omo-Agege declared his intention to run for the office of governor of Delta state. In a statement on Tuesday, the deputy senate president said choosing Niboro as his media director signals his commitment to bring on board only the best and brightest to the campaign organisation. “I have confidence in your capacity, knowledge and experience. Yours is the very first appointment I am making, and it is a signal to the state and country at large that we mean business here,” Omo-Agege said. “We will bring in our best brains; we will put all willing hands on deck; we will lead from the front, and we will win.” After leaving Aso Rock, Niboro served as the managing director of the News Agency of Nigeria (NAN) from 2014 till 2016. Niboro later defected to All Progressives Congress (APC) from the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) in 2016, and in 2018, declared his intention to represent Ughelli north/Ughelli south/Udu federal constituency in the house of representatives. However, Francis Waive, also a member of the APC, won the house of representatives’ seat in the 2019 general election.
