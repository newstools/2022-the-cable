The All Progressives Congress (APC) has fixed May 23 for the screening of its presidential hopefuls for the 2023 general election. Suleiman Arugugun, APC national organising secretary, announced the date on Saturday. “We have so far 28 presidential aspirants, and as you are all aware, some aspirants have started withdrawing their aspirations,” Arugugun said. “And by God’s grace on May 23, those that are left for the screening proper will be screened.” Representing the APC national chairman, Abubakar Kyari, APC deputy national chairman (north), said 145 governorship aspirants will be screened by three panels while 351 senate aspirants will be vetted by four panels. He said a total of 1,197 house of representatives hopefuls would be screened by 10 panels. “We have a very strong party, we have a big party, and we are committed to delivering the right candidates for the forthcoming 2023 general election,” he said. “We have no doubt that the distinguished ladies and gentleman assembled here will do just that. “I wouldn’t want to go into details because we all know ourselves, and we have tried to engage you in a manner that you will also bring your experience to the fore.” He added that the party has produced the best aspirants ahead of the 2023 general election. The ruling party has fixed its convention for the presidential primaries for May 30 to June 1.
