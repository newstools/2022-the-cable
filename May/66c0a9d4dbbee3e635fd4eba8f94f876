Ahead of the 2023 general election, Ajibola Muraina, legislator representing Ibarapa central/Ibarapa north federal constituency in the house of representatives, has defected from the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) to the All Progressives Congress (APC). An unconfirmed number of card-carrying members of the PDP, African Democratic Congress (ADC) and Accord Party (AP) also joined the APC in the state. The defectors include Remi Oseni, the 2019 ADC gubernatorial aspirant; Asiwaju Aderibigbe, ex-chairman of Akinyele LGA; Michael Adegbite, and Wasiu Emiola, former PDP state chairman and secretary. Isaac Omodewu, APC chairman in the state, received the defectors at the weekend, at the party secretariat in Oke Ado, Ibadan, the capital of Oyo. Speaking at the event, Muraina said: “We are here through our defection to complement the efforts of old members of the APC. There is no doubt that the people of Oyo State want development and it is our belief that it is the APC that would make this happen. “While we would allow God to determine things, we would do our part to continue to work for the glory of Oyo State through the platform of APC.” Teslim Folarin, former senator representing Oyo central, said the current administration in Oyo has “drawn” the state backwards. “Everything our administration did, Makinde has drawn us backwards. We are coming to correct that,” he said.
