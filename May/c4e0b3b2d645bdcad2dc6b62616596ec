Three persons were allegedly killed during a boundary clash between Igboho and Igbope communities in Oyo state. Youths in the communities were said to have clashed over an age-long boundary dispute, with both sides suffering casualties. TheCable understands that the communities lay claim to a stretch of land situated along Kishi road. The disputed land is the boundary between the two agrarian communities. On Sunday, renewed argument over the disputed border land degenerated into a bloody fight, with youths on both sides mobilised to the scene. Moroof Alarape, an indigene of Okeho, who has farms in Igbope, said he fled the town with his family members when the fight began. He said Igboho, being a bigger community, sees Igbope as an extension of the town. Alarape said: “I have lived in Igbope for 18 years although I am from Okeho area of Oyo state. I have dairy farm in the town and I am also a food crop farmer. Our occupation in Igbope is mainly farming. “I am aware of the boundary crisis between the two communities since I settled in Igbope with my family but it had never degenerated to a war between them. “On Sunday, my workers returned from farms claiming there was tension in the villages around the disputed land. By Monday morning, the fight that gradually began with abusive words developed into a full-fledge war. Youths fought with dangerous weapons and intermittently retreated. “I left the town with my family on Monday evening and dismissed the workers for their own safety. By Tuesday morning, I learnt from sources that the youths were planning to renew hostilities. Three people have so far been killed.” Adewale Osifeso, police public relations officer in Oyo, had yet to respond to calls and text messages sent to his mobile telephone line.
