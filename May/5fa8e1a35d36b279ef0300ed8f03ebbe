Faruk Yahaya, chief of army staff (COAS), says the Nigerian Army will be more resolute and lethal in dealing with “perceived, future adversaries and threats” to the country. Yahaya spoke on Wednesday at a fire power and tactical maneuver demonstration in line with activities of a seven-day ‘Combat Arms Week Training’ at the Jaji military cantonment in Kaduna state. Yahaya, represented by Victor Ezugwu, commander of the infantry corps, said it is time for adversaries “to rethink their business” because the army will “bring in the full wrath of its strength”. He added that in dealing decisively with perceived, future adversaries and threats, the army will ensure lasting peace and stability in the country. “We will employ our strength to bear on any of the adversaries refusing to stop the carnage they are causing in the country,” he said. “The level of insecurity and collateral damage the adversaries are wreaking on humans and resources in the country is bad and we are going to deal decisively with them.” He said within Jaji axis, the army has taken into consideration the farming and economic activities of the area, adding that troops will ensure the state is safe. “We are holistically taking everything into consideration by carrying everything along with the training to safeguard the loyal citizens while unleashing our strength on the enemies of the country, particular those operating within the Jaji, Zaria and Maraban Jos axis. “We are continuing this operation even after the end of the combat arms training week to ensure that with the air force and paramilitary, we deal decisively with the adversaries.”
