Sadiq Abdullahi, son of Ango Abdullahi, convener of Northern Elders Forum (NEF), has been released by gunmen who attacked the Abuja-Kaduna train. On March 28, a train on its way from Abuja to Kaduna was attacked by gunmen in Kateri-Rijana area of Kaduna state. The train was said to have been a few minutes away from the Kaduna station when the incident occurred. Following the incident, the Nigerian Railway Corporation (NRC) confirmed 21 people as missing. On Monday, a family member confirmed that Abdullahi was released on Friday after spending 31 days in captivity. The relative, who spoke to The Nation, said the gunmen found out the identity of the NEF convener’s son and had decided to negotiate with the family. “You see, that’s why we are very careful now. Negotiations between the government and the terrorists for the release of our loved ones has reached an advanced stage,” the family member told The Nation “We don’t want to jeopardise the process now. We are sure the terrorists found out who Sadik was and later decided to negotiate for his freedom.” As of the time of filing the report, the family is yet to make an official statement regarding the development.
