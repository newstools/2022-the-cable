A group known as the Coalition for Peter Obi has asked the former Anambra governor to pursue his presidential bid in another political party. Obi is one of the presidential hopefuls of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP). In a statement on Tuesday, Zubairu Mohammad, spokesman of the coalition, alleged that some PDP leaders have ganged up to frustrate the presidential aspiration of Obi. Mohammed said the opposition party is encouraging politicians with “no verifiable sources of income to throw money around”. “Recent developments within the leadership of PDP is very pathetic as many chieftains of the party have ganged up to frustrate the presidential ambition of genuine and decent presidential aspirants, thereby encouraging unscrupulous politicians with no verifiable sources of income to throw money around,” the spokesman said. “They are well known individuals in the party who are doing everything possible within their powers to block any chance for credible aspirants to emerge. “The party seems to have adopted an unwritten rule of tacitly encouraging the looting of state resources for party politics. “Many of these political merchants are envious of the nationwide acceptability and sterling performance of Peter Obi both in the public and private sector, making them do everything possible to thwart the former governor of Anambra state’s presidential ambition. “Therefore, as a coalition which consists of more than 17 groups with ten million active voters, we call on his Excellency, Mr Peter Obi to dump PDP and look for another political platform with people of like mind to pursue his presidential ambition to enable him help salvage our sinking nation.” Peter Obi Support Network (POSN), Like Minds for Peter Obi (LMPO), Nigeria Needs Peter Obi (NNPO), TakeBackNaija (TBN), and Women for Peter Obi (WPO) are some of the groups that make up the coalition.
