Aisha Buhari, first lady, has asked the All Progressives Congress (APC) not to sideline women in the contest for tickets for elective positions in 2023. Aisha spoke on Saturday at a summit for APC female aspirants at the state house conference centre, Abuja. Women interested in the ticket of the APC for elective positions are expected to only pay for the expression of interest form while the nomination form is free. Speaking at the summit, the first lady said she does not believe in free gifts, urging female aspirants to unite to create an impactful space within the political arena. “I stand before you today as a mother, as a leader, as a sister, believing that today’s summit will make a difference in our lives as women and mothers of the nation,” Aisha said. “To the chairman of our party, governors and party executives, I commend your efforts in supporting women over the years. “However, I would like to draw your attention that it is now time to believe in women more and show more solidarity with them. “Distinguished guests, it is important to mention the efforts made by our great party towards promoting women’s participation in politics. “I appreciate and commend the recent party’s gesture in offering free nomination forms to female aspirants. “Honorable Emma Eneukwu representing the chairman of our great party, I don’t want the party to use the free forms as a means of sidelining women at the end of the day. “I don’t believe in free gifts. But with Dr Betta there as our leader, I believe the APC will not relegate women to the back seat.” On her part, Dolapo Osinbajo, wife of the vice-president, encouraged the women to get ready to take charge of the decision-making process of the country. “Get ready, get ready, because it’s time for us to take our seats at the table,” she said.
