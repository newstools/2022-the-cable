The Nigeria Customs Service (NCS) says it has commenced a probe into a viral video wherein one of its officers was seen slapping Samson Nwachukwu, an aide to Ifeanyi Okowa, governor of Delta. The video, which appeared on social media over the weekend, shows a customs officer slapping a man during a conversation. In the video, the customs officer asked the man, identified as Nwachukwu, the question ‘who are you?’ before the slap. While details of what happened prior to the slap are unclear, the incident was said to have happened along the Benin-Agbor expressway on Saturday.
