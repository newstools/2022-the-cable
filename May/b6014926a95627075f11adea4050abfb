Our focus is to ensure that Bauchi is back on track to recovery and sustainable development. On the issue of out-of-school children, we will revive and bring back to life our comatose public education. “On the issue of maternity death, we will provide facilities and expertise that will help, and by the grace of God, curb the menace of maternal death due to lack of healthcare access. “And on the path of agriculture we will devise new ways to secure the people and support them in realizing higher yields beyond the normal subsistence level to an industrial level. “We thank the State Party Chairman and his excos, dignitaries, and the great people of Bauchi for honoring our invitation to this event. We want to use this opportunity to call on our delegates to put this party’s interest and elect a candidate that has the will, determination and support of the people to win the election come 2023.”
