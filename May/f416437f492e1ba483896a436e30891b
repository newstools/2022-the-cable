The Indigenous People of Biafra (IPOB) has cautioned political parties against holding rallies in the south-east. In a statement issued on Friday, Emma Powerful, IPOB spokesperson, specifically warned Ikechi Emenike, a governorship hopeful on the platform of the All Progressives Congress (APC), against hosting a political rally in Abia state. According to IPOB, Emenike and other politicians running for elective offices have “shown no concern” about the killings and abductions in the geopolitical zone. “We want to advise Chief Ikechi Emenike and his APC people not to hold any political rally in Umuahia tomorrow, Friday, May 20, 2022, while they kept quiet and did nothing when Fulani bandits kidnapped passengers including female students along Okigwe/ Uturu road,” the statement reads. “We cannot allow Emenike and his APC co-travellers to be dancing and singing at Chidiebere Park while our daughters are still in captivity. “It is hypocrisy for the political elite to show no concern about the plights of our people who they claim to be seeking their welfare. It is wickedness for Emenike and his co-travellers to keep mute and do nothing about the incessant abductions of Igbo sons and daughters by Fulani herdsmen around Uturu and its environs. Ikechi Emenike should keep away from Chidiebere Park Umuahia tomorrow. “We won’t allow APC and other political parties to continue to hold their rallies in our land while Fulani bandits operative with impunity Kidnapping and rapping our people, yet the politicians do nothing about it. All they care about is 2023. Enough is enough.” The proscribed separatist group said it is unacceptable for politicians to be campaigning for votes while residents live at the mercy of assailants.
