Twenty-one residents kidnapped from Anguwan Bulus, a community near Sabon Tasha GRA in Kaduna, have been released after four weeks in captivity. A total of 25 residents were kidnapped from the community on March 31, and days later, three of them were killed over “delay in the payment of ransom”. Two persons were killed during the March 31 attack, while 26 others were abducted — but one person was later released on health grounds. One person is, however, said to still be in captivity. Confirming the development to TheCable on Thursday, Gideon Goni, the community leader, said the victims were released on April 29. “They have released 21 of them, remaining one person — an elderly man named Mr. Bitrus,” Goni said. “They were demanding for N5.5 million for the release of the Baba, but now they have reduced the ransom to N2 million. “The 21 people were released on Friday last week. The bandits were demanding N100 million for their release when we were negotiating with the community. But after they killed those three people, they said they wanted to contact individual families of the victims to negotiate with them. “A total of about N27 million was raised. Some families paid N4 million, some raised N5 million. Three motorbikes, each costing N750,000, were purchased for them in addition to the ransom.”
