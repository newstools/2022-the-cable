EnterpriseNGR, a professional policy and advocacy group, has announced the launch of an internship programme to bridge the skills gap in Nigeria. The initiative titled ‘Youth of Enterprise (YOE) Internship Programme’ is a paid six-month scheme designed to help address national youth unemployment and enhance Nigeria’s future productive capacity. EnterpriseNGR said the programme will address the gap in youth employability. “Through the YOE Internship Programme, EnterpriseNGR seeks to improve the employability of Nigerian youth,” the statement reads. “The Programme aims to improve the skillsets, professional competence and employability of young graduates. “YOE participants will obtain invaluable workplace experience and networking opportunities which will position them for meaningful career journeys.” Speaking on the initiative, Obi Ibekwe, chief executive officer of EnterpriseNGR, said, “We all know the difficulty young people face in finding jobs. With YOE this will be a thing of the past”. “EnterpriseNGR is leveraging its reach to raise a network of premium organisations that are willing to offer internship opportunities to young Nigerian graduates. “For our Nigerian youth, YOE is your one-stop-shop for exploring pathways to the career of your dream.” The statement said employers participating in the YOE internship programme would have the opportunity to guide and evaluate placed talent for six months before considering them for recruitment. They would also be able to cost-efficiently build a pipeline of entry-level talent, reduce the size and scope of their orientation programmes and improve the performance of their organisations by infusing fresh academic knowledge, digitisation and innovation into their systems. It added that interested youth can attend the programme via the EnterpriseNGR website.
