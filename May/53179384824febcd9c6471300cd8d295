Nigeria’s Joe Aribo scored the opener for Rangers as the Scottish giants lost the Europa League final to Eintracht Frankfurt of Germany 5-4 on penalties following a 1-1 scoreline and extra time. The thrilling encounter took place at the Ramon Sanchez Pizjuan Stadium in Seville, Spain on Wednesday night. Aribo featured for 101 minutes while  Aaron Ramsey’s missed spot-kick means Rangers will continue their 50-year European title drought. Aribo, who fluffed the first chance of the encounter in the first half, gave Rangers the lead on 57 minutes when he pounced on a misjudged header to fire a shot that crept past the opposition goalkeeper for a deserved opener. The dogged Germans kept plugging away and finally got the equalizer on 69 minutes, with Rafael Borre pouncing at the near post to stab home as Rangers defence failed to clear a cross. Rangers had several chances to win it in regulation and extra time but were kept at bay by the opposition goalkeeper who also saved Ramsey’s poor penalty before Borre scored again with the final kick in shootout. Frankfurt’s latest title triumph is their first European trophy in 42 years, since lifting the UEFA Cup in 1980.
