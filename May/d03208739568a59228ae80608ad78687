Samuel Kanu, prelate of the Methodist Church Nigeria (MCN), has been abducted by gunmen. He was said to have been kidnapped on Sunday along the Enugu-Port Harcourt expressway in Umunneochi LGA of Abia state. Dennis Mark, the bishop of Owerri, as well as another cleric, were also said to have been abducted during the attack. Geoffrey Ogbonna, Abia police spokesperson, confirmed the incident to TheCable. According to him, efforts are ongoing to ensure the rescue of the clerics. “We have intensified effort mobilising all our tactical teams to ensure that the prelate and the other priests that are with him are rescued unhurt and for a possible arrest of the suspects,” Ogbonna said. “We are calling on members of the public to help with credible information that will help us rescue the victims.” The development is the latest in attacks on states in the south-east in recent months, leading to killings, abductions and destruction of properties — including government facilities such as police stations. In a recent attack which occurred in February, eight people were killed when gunmen invaded a cattle market in the state. Months before the attack on the cattle market, Godfrey Chimezie, a Catholic priest, was abducted by gunmen. The priest, however, regained his freedom after more than one week in captivity.
