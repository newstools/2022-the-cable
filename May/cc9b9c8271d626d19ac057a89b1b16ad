Mehmet Ulgen, a consultant interventional cardiologist with Nizamiye Hospital Abuja, says regular exercise is good for cardiac health. Speaking in an interactive session with journalists, Ulgen said hypertension and obesity are some of the major causes of heart disease. “Cardiovascular diseases are a major cause of death and disability in Nigeria and the rest of the world. Vascular disease affects all organs, especially vital organs such as the brain, eyes, kidneys, and the heart,” he said. He, therefore, advised Nigerians to take their health seriously through preventive measures, adding that in cardiac health, prevention is always a better alternative. “The best way to get rid of the problems caused by heart and vascular disease is preventive measures. These preventive measures are vital, especially for those with a family history of heart or vascular disease,” he said. He said some measures to reduce the risk of heart disease include reducing excessive intake of carbohydrate and salty meals, and avoiding being obese. “The prevalence of obesity is alarming and invites many diseases, especially diabetes. Obesity also causes cholesterol overload and high blood pressure. Obese people should adopt healthy eating habits,” he said. “Avoid inactivity: With the change in today’s lifestyle, we have been dragged into a more sitting, non-walking, non-moving lifestyle; exercise regularly, If possible, walk for at least an hour every day, use the car less, and at least go to and from close distances on foot instead of by car; undergo regular medical checkups. “With the improvement of lifestyle, the risk of high blood pressure, diabetes, and vascular calcification decrease significantly.”
