Members of the Islamic State in West Africa (ISWAP) have kidnapped Bulama Geidam, a health worker with General Hospital, Gubio, Borno state. The insurgents were said to have attacked the town on Wednesday at about 2am and looted food items and fuel from a humanitarian truck. Residents fled for safety during the attack, returning to their homes after the insurgents had withdrawn from the town. According to sources, the health worker called for help when the ISWAP members invaded his house. Confirming the abduction, Juliana Bitruce, the state commissioner for health, described the incident as “unfortunate and disturbing”. She said the abducted health worker was among those who remained at their duty posts despite the challenges of insecurity in the area. “The ministry will write to officially inform all the concerned security agencies, including the theater command, operation Hadin Kai,” she said. The commissioner also prayed for the safe release of the health worker. When TheCable contacted Kamikudeen Sanu, the Borno police spokesperson, he said the command was not yet aware of the incident but would look into it. The north-east has continued to face the challenge of attacks by insurgents, resulting in deaths and displacement. Recently, suspected Boko Haram insurgents attacked the Police Mobile Force (PMF) training college in Limankara, Gwoza, Borno state.
