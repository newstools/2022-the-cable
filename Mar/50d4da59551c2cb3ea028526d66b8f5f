President Muhammadu Buhari says his administration remains committed to tackling security challenges in the country. According to a statement issued on Tuesday by Garba Shehu, presidential spokesman, Buhari said this in reaction to the recent killing of vigilante operatives in Kebbi state. Over 60 vigilante operatives were said to have been killed after gunmen invaded some communities in Sakaba/Wassagu LGA of the state. Expressing sadness over what he described as “the brutal murder of tens of vigilante members”, Buhari also expressed his condolences to the family members of the deceased. “This egregious level of criminality is shocking and I want to assure Nigerians that I will do all it takes to tackle this monster decisively,” he was quoted as saying. “My greatest preoccupation is the threat to life posed by these murderous gangs and remorseless outlaws who have no slightest regard for the sanctity of life. “While extending my sympathy to the families of the victims of this savagery, let me use this opportunity to also call on our security forces to be more proactive and redouble their efforts in order to frustrate the operational plans of the terrorists before they even launch attacks.”
