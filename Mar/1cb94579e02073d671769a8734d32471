An explosion on Saturday rocked the BUA cement factory in Sokoto state killing three workers. According to NAN, three persons sustained injuries, while equipment and valuables of the company were also destroyed by the inferno. It was reported that combined teams of federal and state fire service officers have arrived at the scene of the incident. NAN reports that interim situation information indicated that the inferno is suspected to be caused by an uploading fuel tanker. A source told NAN that a worker was repairing a stationed tank when the explosion ignited. The source said three persons died and three others sustained injuries as a result of the incident, which was said to have overpowered the company’s safety officers. Nuhu Lawal, prevention officer of Sokoto state fire service, confirmed the incident, adding that they have mobilised teams and moved fire fighting equipment to the location. Lawal declined further comments, stressing that the combined teams are still making efforts to put out the fire. Umar Nura-Sifawa, an official of the Federal Fire Service in Sokoto, who was also at the scene, said, “it is an ‘oil fire’ which takes a longer period to extinguish”. Nura-Sifawa said the combined teams are trying to stop the fire from spreading to other areas besides the oil compartment.
