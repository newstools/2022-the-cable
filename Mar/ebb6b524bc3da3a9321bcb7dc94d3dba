The Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) has inaugurated its 37-member zoning committee. Iyorchia Ayu, PDP national chairman, inaugurated the committee on Thursday at the party’s headquarters in Abuja. The committee was set up at the joint meeting of the board of trustees (BOT) and the national executive committee (NEC) of the party on March 16. With two weeks to complete its work, the committee is expected to make a recommendation on the zoning of the presidential ticket. Members include Samuel Ortom, Ifeanyi Ugwuanyi and Darius Ishaku, governors of Benue, Enugu and Taraba respectively. Speaking at the inauguration, Ayu advised members of the committee to be focused on carrying out their assignments. “Let us not have any rancour whatsoever,” he said. “At the end of the day, remain focused on the main goal. That main goal is for us to win power next year. “We can only win power by uniting and working together because if you are from Ebonyi or Anambra and you fight to become the president of our country through the PDP, even if you win the party nomination, other people will not vote for you. They will not be willing to work for you. “But if you pursue it without bitterness everyone will rally around you next year.” Ayu expressed confidence that the opposition party will regain power in 2023.
