A magistrates’ court in Ota, Ogun state, has ordered a 40-year-old housewife, Biola Joshua, to sweep the premises of Iju-Ebiye High School for six months. Biola was said to have invaded her son’s school with thugs after which the police charged her with conspiracy, assault and breach of peace. Delivering the ruling on Wednesday, Shotunde Shotayo, the magistrate, ordered the convict to sweep the school from 8am to 11am daily for the period of the sentence. Shotayo also directed the school to open a log book for the convict where her daily activities would be recorded for the six months. Biola was, however, given an option of N30,000 fine to be handed to the principal and the teacher who were attacked. The judge held that the prosecution proved its case beyond reasonable doubt, adding that Biola was guilty of the charges preferred against her. The convict, whose address was not provided, had pleaded not guilty to the charge. Earlier, Cynthia Ejezie, the prosecution counsel, had told the court that the convict, her son and others at large, committed the offence on March 11, 2021, at about 2pm at Iju-Ebiye High School. Ejezie said the convict and her accomplices assaulted the school principal and health officer of the school, adding that they conducted themselves in a manner likely to cause breach of peace by disrupting the activities of the school with thugs. The prosecutor said the offence contravened the provisions of sections 249(d), 355 and 516 of the Criminal Code Laws of Ogun, 2006.
