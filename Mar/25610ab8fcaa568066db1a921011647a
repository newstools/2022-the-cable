Ahmed Isa, an aide to Danjuma Goje, senator representing Gombe central, says the All Progressives Congress (APC) in the state is in “disarray”. Goje and Inuwa Yahaya, Gombe governor, have been at loggerheads over issues bordering on the party and governance in the state. At a meeting convened by Abdullahi Adamu, a serving senator and former chairman of the APC reconciliation committee, in January, it was agreed that the issues that arose from the party’s congresses in the state will be addressed. But in a statement on Sunday, Isa said months after the agreement, nothing has been done by the party to ensure that there is peace in the state. “The media office of Senator Goje expresses shock that over three months after the meeting, no further moves to advance the peace efforts, contrary to the resolutions reached during the peace parley,” he said. “As loyal and peace-loving party stalwarts of the party that contributed immensely to laying the foundation, building it, and leading it to victory in 2019, we want to state that jettisoning of the idea initiated to cement the cracks in the party will lead APC to nowhere but defeat come 2023. “If this happens, no one should blame our leader and father, Senator Goje, who despite the ill-treatment meted out on him by those he brought to power, embraced the peace moves in line with Islamic Injunctions. “Let no one be deceived, as it is, our beloved party is in disarray in Gombe State and this must be addressed for us to be able to maintain our leading role in the state. “The party is grumbling and this explains the gale of defection and resignation being witnessed daily.”
