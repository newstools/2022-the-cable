The Kaduna government has asked residents to be watchful as terrorists may be planning to plant explosives in public facilities in the state. This warning comes after an explosion occurred in Kabala west area of Kaduna on Sunday. Speaking on the incident, the Kaduna police said the explosion was suspected to have been caused by an improvised explosive device (IED), which was planted in a building along the Nnamdi Azikiwe bypass. In a statement issued on Monday, Samuel Aruwan, Kaduna commissioner for internal security and home affairs, said assessments by security agencies indicate that terrorists may be planning to harm citizens with explosives. “The Kaduna state government wishes to issue a crucial advisory to citizens across the state, for heightened alertness to the threat of explosive devices planted in public places by terrorists,” the statement reads. “This follows sustained assessments by security agencies, and the possibility of terrorists looking to harm citizens, by discreetly placing explosives in public facilities such as schools, hospitals, hotels, bars, entertainment centres, restaurants, parks, major roads and places of worship. “Security agencies are working to ensure that no harm or destruction comes to residents and facilities. “Citizens are, however, urged to be alive to this threat, and to remain watchful for suspicious persons loitering, or packages seemingly abandoned in strategic places. “Increased general awareness is strongly advised, and frequent thorough checks of premises are recommended. “Any suspicious person or object observed must be immediately reported to the nearest security formation. The security operations room may also be contacted, on the lines 09034000060 and 08170189999.”
