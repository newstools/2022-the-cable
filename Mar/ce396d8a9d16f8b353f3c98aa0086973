The Taliban government in Afghanistan has instructed all government employees to wear a beard and adhere to a dress code or risk being fired. Representatives from the ministry for the propagation of virtue and prevention of vice were reportedly patrolling the entrances to government offices on Monday to check that employees were in compliance with the new rules. Employees were reportedly instructed not to shave their beards and to wear local clothing consisting of a long, loose top and trousers, and a hat or turban. They were also told to ensure they prayed at the correct times. The Taliban had earlier banned women from taking flights without male chaperones and had also failed to open girls’ schools as promised. Schoolgirls beyond grade six were turned away from their classes following a decision by the Taliban government to keep school doors closed to them. On Sunday, the Taliban ordered that men and women should not visit parks in Kabul, the country’s capital, on the same days. Women are allowed to enter three days a week (from Sunday to Wednesday) while the remaining days are reserved for men. Following its assumption of power last August, the Taliban had said it would not force its rules on anyone as it relates to lifestyle choices. But with recent hardline instructions, the Islamic government has contradicted the assurances it made to the people. The government has drawn criticisms from Western governments for forcing its rules on all Afghans.
