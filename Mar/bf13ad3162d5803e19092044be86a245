Former Vice-President Atiku Abubakar will formally declare his intention to run for the office of the president on Wednesday. Last week, a group known as Northeast Business Community paid for Atiku to secure the nomination and expression of interest forms of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP). The amount of both forms was pegged at N40 million. The group, which was led by Abubakar Funakayi, had presented the forms to the former vice-president at his residence. According to a statement from Atiku’s media office on Sunday, he will declare his intention to contest the 2023 presidency at the International Conference Centre, Abuja by 11am. “After several months of consultations with stakeholders across the country and in the diaspora, as well as all organs of the Peoples Democratic Party, Nigeria’s former Vice President and presidential candidate of the PDP in the 2019 election, Atiku Abubakar, will officially declare his intent to run for the 2023 presidential election on Wednesday, March 23, 2022,” the statement reads. “The event which will have Atiku Abubakar’s friends, associates, political leaders, party faithful, and supporters in attendance will take place at the International Conference Centre, Abuja at 11 am. “His official declaration kickstarts the former Vice President’s participation in the race for the presidential ticket of the PDP ahead of the next year’s general election.”
