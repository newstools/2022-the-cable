Pelumi Abegunde, older brother of the fashion designer who went missing after boarding a BRT bus, said Comfort Ayanwola, their mother, fainted immediately she heard the news of her daughter’s death. TheCable had reported that Bamise was found dead on Monday — nine days after she was declared missing. Andrew Nice, driver of the BRT bus which Bamise boarded, was arrested by officers of the Department of State Services (DSS) and handed over to the police. Speaking in a chat with Arise TV on Thursday, Abegunde said ever since his mother heard the news, she’s been waking up to cry in the middle of the night. He added that a pregnant sister of Bamise is still hospitalised while trying to recover from the shock of the news. “By the time I was able to gather some elders of the church to break the news, they were many, and they did a lot of dilly-dallying before they said god giveth and taketh, immediately my mom fainted,” Abegunde said. “My mother fainted, and I don’t think she’s mentally okay ever since. My mother wakes up every night to cry. “Bamise’s immediate elder sister, who is pregnant, is currently hospitalised because she also fainted right here. “She has not been herself.  As for me, I don’t even know where the courage to speak is coming from. because Bamise is my confidant.”
