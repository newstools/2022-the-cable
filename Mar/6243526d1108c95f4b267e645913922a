Babajide Sanwo-Olu, governor of Lagos, says the state is “ready” to absorb investors from all parts of the country. The governor said Lagos has sufficient land to accommodate more investment opportunities. He spoke on Tuesday at the inauguration of the Dangote Fertiliser Plant — the largest in Africa and second-largest in the world. President Muhammadu Buhari had earlier inaugurated the three million metric tonnes plant situated in Ibeju Lekki. Sanwo-Olu said it was pertinent to replicate the strides of Aliko Dangote across the country. “How do we ensure that indeed, we put other Aliko Dangotes in other parts of this country and they can domesticate all of these great initiatives,” he said. “So, the story is not about him today, it’s about all of us. How many others do you want to build? Lagos is home and is ready. “We’re ready for business, Lagos is open for investment. We have sufficient land for you. Don’t think that it’s Kebbi, Kaduna that have land. We have sufficient land for you to absorb all of your investments that you might be thinking about.” The governor said the state will be inaugurating the largest rice mill in the country in the next two months. He said the rice mill and the fertiliser plant will improve job creation and empower farmers across the country.
