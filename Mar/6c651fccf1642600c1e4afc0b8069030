At least 16 people have been killed in an attack by bandits on Ganar-Kiyawa village in Bukkuyum LGA of Zamfara state. The attack was said to have occurred at about 8:30am on Sunday. The gunmen reportedly stormed the community and started shooting sporadically, killing villagers, including the village head. Confirming the incident in a statement on Monday, Muhammad Shehu, Zamfara police spokesman, said contrary to reports that said 24 people were killed, 16 people lost their lives in attack. “The Zamfara police command, in collaboration with the military, are currently at the affected community conducting an extensive bush-combing with a view to returning normalcy and apprehending the perpetrators of this bizarre crime,” he added. Meanwhile, Bello Matawalle, governor of Zamfara, has expressed sadness over the incident, describing it as “dastardly and cowardly”. According to a statement by Zailani Bappa, his spokesman, the governor condoled with the families of the victims and assured residents that the recent attack would not deter his administration’s efforts to achieve total peace in the state. “It is unfortunate that this attack is coming at a time when we are experiencing improved peace in the state, where we were able to host millions of people in an important religious event without a single incident,” he said. “However, this and other isolated cases of banditry across the state will not deter our efforts at ensuring a peaceful Zamfara, an oath we have taken to pursue with our fullest capability.” Matawalle also asked the ministry of humanitarian affairs and disaster management to release relief materials to all victims of the attack and their families.
