The Human and Environmental Development Agenda (HEDA) has asked the house of representatives to pass the Proceeds of Crime Bill 2022. The senate had, on March 9, passed the bill followed the consideration of a report by the joint committee on anti-corruption and financial crimes; and judiciary, human rights and legal matters. Presenting the joint committee’s report, Suleiman Kwari, senator representing Kaduna north, said the bill would make provisions regarding the seizure, confiscation and forfeiture of properties derived from unlawful activities. In a statement on Tuesday, Olanrewaju Suraju, HEDA chairman, commended the senate for passing the bill. Suraju said the bill, if signed into law,  will go a long way in exposing persons sabotaging the country’s economy, adding that the benefits of the proposed legislation “will be unprecedented”. “The amount of money stolen and banked in different foreign banks and properties in different parts of the world, illegally acquired by some Nigerians since independence till date, is more than enough to not only turn Nigeria into a cynosure but envy of the world,” he said. “Today, what do we have? Apart from suffering of resource curses, we are the capital poverty of the world, the sixth most miserable people on earth. “Nigerians are not expected to live anywhere below average. But due to the diabolic attitude of some persons, Nigerians now attract sympathy, a laughing stock, and the political leaders are doing just little to redeem the image of the giant of Africa.” The organisation asked the house of representatives to follow the senate’s lead so that the bill can be transmitted to the president for assent.
