Ahmed Musa, Super Eagles captain, says the team is ready to repay Nigerians for the setbacks they endured during the African Cup of Nations (AFCON) with a victory over Ghana. Both teams are billed to battle for Qatar 2022 World Cup ticket in a two-legged affair taking place later this month in Kumasi and Abuja. Speaking about the World Cup playoff on Tuesday, Musa said the clash between the two West African neighbours is “like a fight on the pitch and off it”. He also promised that the team will try its best to beat Ghana and secure the World Cup ticket. “I remember that friendly game that we played against Ghana at the Watford stadium. The game ended goallessly, but it was very tough. So it’s like a fight on the pitch and off it. We know that this game will not be very easy so we have to give all we’ve got in the first game and see what we can have before we come back home and we’ll try our best,” Musa said. “It’s not only about football. Let me say it’s about politics, jollof rice, music, acting, fashion, everything. So football has gotten together again to show who is the king. They have good records against Nigeria, but this is a new generation of the Super Eagles. “We will do our best to make them happy. I know we promised to win the AFCON, but we had setbacks. So the only to make Nigerians proud is to give them the World Cup ticket.” The first leg will be held at the Baba Yara Stadium in Kumasi on March 25, while the second leg follows at the MKO Abiola National Stadium, Abuja, four days later.
