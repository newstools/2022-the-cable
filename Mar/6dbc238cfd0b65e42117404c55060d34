Dolapo Osinbajo, wife of Vice-President Yemi Osinbajo, is currently in the chamber of the senate. Dolapo is at the red chamber to observe proceedings in the alteration of the constitution. A part of the 68 bills on the alteration of the constitution seeks 37 senate seats for women. Last week, Aisha Buhari, first lady, was in the chamber when Ovie Omo-Agege, deputy president of the senate and chairman of the constitution review committee, laid a report on the bills. Speaking at the time, Senate President Ahmad Lawan said the national assembly under him, was gender sensitive. “The First Lady has been consistent in supporting gender inclusivity, we are all in support of gender sensitivity. In this senate we have only two groups, the female senators and ‘he for shes’,” the senate president had said. “This is a report on the constitution review and the presence of the First Lady is to show her support for one of the bills on affirmative action for more female parliamentarians in both chambers, the senate and the house and the state legislatures.”
