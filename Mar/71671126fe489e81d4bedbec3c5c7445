A federal high court in Abuja has threatened to strike out a fraud suit brought against Rochas Okorocha, senator representing Imo west. The Economic and Financial Crimes Commission (EFCC) had, on January 31, filed a 17-count charge against the former Imo governor before a federal high court in Abuja. The charge against Okorocha came hours after he formally declared his intention to run for president. According to the EFCC, the former Imo governor allegedly conspired with others, including a member of the All Progressives Congress (APC) and five companies, to steal N2.9 billion public funds. Aside from Okorocha, other defendants are Anyim Nyerere Chinenye, Naphtali International Limited, Perfect Finish Multi Projects Limited, Consolid Projects Consulting Limited, Pramif International Limited, and Legend World Concepts Limited. When the case came up on February 22, the former governor was not in court and he did not have any legal representation. Cosmos Ugwu, EFCC counsel, told the court that he has been unable to serve court processes on Okorocha. At the court session on Monday, Ugwu said he was still unable to serve the first defendant with the charge. “In view of this, we plead with my lord to graciously accommodate us with an adjournment,” he said. Inyang Ekwo, the presiding judge, said though he would grant the prayer for another adjournment, if he (Ugwu) came up with the same excuse on the next adjourned date, the matter would be struck out. “One month plus you are still coming to say you are yet to serve,” the judge said. “This will be the last time this matter will be adjourned.” The judge said the adjournment was to see how serious the commission was about prosecuting the matter. He then adjourned the matter until May 30 for the defendants to be arraigned.
