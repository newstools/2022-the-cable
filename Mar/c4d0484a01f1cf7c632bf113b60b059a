“I came into CU with the mind of a child. I have grown in wisdom in the things of God and in wisdom for everyday living. I learnt how to deal with certain situations and people with the maturity required and I couldn’t be more proud. His grace and goodness on me, I mean, how else could I maintain beauty when CU stress hit?” The above were the words of Hephzibah Adeniji after she graduated with a first-class from Covenant University in October 2021. But Hephzibah’s story isn’t the regular. Having been diagnosed with sickle cell disease at an early age and losing her mother — whom she describes as her motivation — during the heat of the COVID pandemic in May 2020, graduating with a CGPA of 4.96/5 as the best student in biological sciences was an uncommon feat. Beyond achieving the top position in her department, she was also the second best graduating student in the university. She attributes her resolve to God, family, a strong support system represented through “God-sent helpers who are now family”, and a unique understanding that pain will only last a while. As she puts it: “I maximise the times when I’m well, so that when I fall sick, I’m not entirely at a loss.” As the world celebrates International Women’s Day 2022 with the theme #BreakTheBias, Hephzibah tells her story of defying sickle cell disease to excel in her field.
