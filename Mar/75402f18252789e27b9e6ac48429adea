Abubakar Malami, attorney general of the federation (AGF), says he did not exonerate Abba Kyari, suspended deputy commissioner of police (DCP), on the alleged case  of money laundering. In July 2021, the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) revealed how Kyari allegedly collaborated with Hushpuppi, a self-confessed international fraudster, to arrest another fraudster “after a dispute over a $1.1 million scam on Qatari business people”. On August 26, Usman Baba, inspector-general of police (IGP), received the report of the panel set up to probe the bribery allegations against Kyari over his alleged relationship with Hushpuppi. The police thereafter sent the report to Malami for legal advice. In his advice, Malami had said there was a prima facie case of money laundering and that further investigations should be conducted into the matter. But in a recent advice dated February 4, the AGF said there is no “sufficient evidence” that Kyari was involved in money laundering. The recent advice had fuelled speculations that Malami was trying to exonerate Kyari. However, in a statement on Sunday, Malami, through his spokesperson, Umar Gwandu, said there appears to be a misunderstanding regarding the issue. Gwandu said the office of the AGF requested a further probe in relation to some aspects of the investigation. “The office of the Attorney General of the Federation and Minister of Justice’s stance is that no conclusion has been reached in the direction of absence of evidence relating to the first report,” the statement reads. “The issues were raised for further investigation with a view to cover the field in investigation in order to arrive at informed decision.”
