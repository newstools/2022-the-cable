Scores of Islamic State of West African Province (ISWAP) fighters have been killed by troops of operation Hadin Kai in Borno, military sources have told TheCable. The insurgents were said to have launched an attack on the troops’ base in Doron Baga, Kukawa LGA, in the early hours of Saturday. Sources said the insurgents, armed with grenades and five gun trucks, were overpowered by the troops. The troops were said to have engaged the insurgents in a gun battle that lasted for about two hours. The overwhelming firepower from the troops, sources said, resulted in the killing of unconfirmed numbers of the insurgents, while several others were injured. “There was a heavy casualty on the side of the insurgents,” one of the sources said. TheCable understands that the insurgents evacuated bodies of their fighters and those wounded through Daban Masara, Madayi and Gratai axes. Military formations have always been targets for the insurgents who have been terrorising the north-east for over ten years. In the past months, however, the military has continued to launch offensives on the insurgents. On Friday, the army had reported how its troops killed several ISWAP/Boko Haram terrorists around Ndufu and Musiri villages in Borno. According to the army, the troops recovered weapons and rescued 30 kidnapped local residents. The army also added that its troops destroyed various camps of the terrorists as clearance operations are still ongoing.
