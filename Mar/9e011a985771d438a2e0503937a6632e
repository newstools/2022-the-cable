The federal government has blamed the low water levels in the hydro dams for the erratic power supply in the country. Abubakar Aliyu, minister of power, said the dry season resulted in the reduced hydro capacity of the dams. The minister spoke on Thursday in Abuja during the state house ministerial briefing. “I would like to discuss the increased load shedding. You may have observed in Abuja and other areas in the country. With the reduction in hydro capacity during the dry season, additional loads need to be taken up by our gas plants,” he said. The minister said the ongoing maintenance work on some power plants around the country also contributed to the reduced power supply. “We are having maintenance work in the eastern axis around Odupami, leading to reduced power supply from the usually reliable NDPHC Calabar power plant, and we are having challenges at Okoloma gas station linked to AFAM 6 power plant,” he said. “We are working with NNPC and other gas suppliers. Also to improve the pressure on the western axis, and that is precluding this unit from reaching optimum supply. These challenges are surmountable.” The minister said the government is doing everything to make available an optimum supply of gas to ensure quick restoration of power.
