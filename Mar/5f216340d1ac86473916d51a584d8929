Femi Adesina, presidential spokesman, says the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) is only interested in destabilising the country. In a statement issued on Tuesday, he said no patriotic political party threatens its country with anarchy, social upheaval and disorderliness. “The Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) has given itself away as being interested only in the destabilisation of the country, peradventure it could then sneak its way back to power,” he said. “Less than 24 hours after the Department of State Services (DSS) raised alarm about sinister plots by some elements to cause disorder in the land, using the energy crisis as a smokescreen, the PDP issued a statement, saying; “Our party fears that the situation is getting to a boiling point and can trigger a nationwide agitation that might be worse than the October 2020 EndSARS if not addressed immediately. “Which patriotic political party or organization ever threatens its country with anarchy, social upheaval and disorderliness, except one still smarting from its snout being yanked from the honeypot, as happened to PDP in 2015?” The PDP had on Monday warned that Nigeria’s situation is getting to a boiling point and could trigger a nationwide agitation that might be worse than the October 2020 #EndSARS protest. Adesina said #EndSARS signifies murder, mayhem mass destruction and cannibalism. “EndSARS signified murder, mayhem, mass destruction, even cannibalism. PDP now wishes Nigeria something worse,” he said. “A presidential aspirant of the PDP has warned that the party would die by 2023 unless it wins the Number One position in the country. And die it would if the party wishes the country nothing except something worse than EndSARS.”
