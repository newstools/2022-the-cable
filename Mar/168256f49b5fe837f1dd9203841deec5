Nigeria’s Flamingos defeated DR Congo 3-0 in the FIFA U-17 women’s World Cup qualifier in Kinshasa. The three-time World Cup quarter-finalists started the game like a house on fire and dominated the hosts — but they were made to work hard for the opening goal. Blessing Emmanuel opened the scoresheet for the Flamingos in the 36th minute courtesy of Miracle Usani’s pull out. There were subsequent near misses and shunned penalty appeals, and the first half ended 1-0 in favour of Nigeria. In the 63rd minute, Bankole Olowookere, the coach, threw Raheemot Adebayo and Anastasia Atume into the fray, pulling out Aminat Bello and Kafayat Bashiru. The changes brought instant reward as Atume was fouled near the Congolese goal area, and Tumininu Adeshina rammed the ball into the net for Nigeria’s second. Atume missed a sitter two minutes later, but with 14 minutes to go, Taiwo Ajakaye took on the Congolese defence and teased out goalkeeper before finishing smoothly for Nigeria’s third goal. The Congolese ended the game with 10 players as Nwanji was given a red card with 20 minutes to go. The second leg fixture will take place on March 19 at the Samuel Ogbemudia Stadium, Benin, Edo state. If victorious, the Flamingos will meet the Egyptian U-17 side in the third round.
