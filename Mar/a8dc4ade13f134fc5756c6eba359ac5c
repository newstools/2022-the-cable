The National Drug Law Enforcement Agency (NDLEA) has decorated Musiliu Akinsanya, popularly known as MC Oluomo, as an ‘ambassador of war against drug abuse (WADA)’ in Lagos motor parks. According to Mallum Musa, Lagos NDLEA spokesperson, Akinsanya was decorated as an ambassador when Callys Alumona, its Lagos commander, led the agency’s management on an advocacy visit to Akinsanya, who is the chairman of the National Union of Road Transport Worker (NURTW) in the state. Alumona said the visit was to strengthen the partnership between the agency and the union in order to tackle illicit drug use across the state. He said the war against drug abuse and illicit trafficking would be more effective through collaboration. “The NURTW is critical in the war because they are service contractors, who provide transportation for human beings, goods and services in the country,” Alumona said. “The union must conduct a proper check on all loads in their vehicles before embarking on any trip. “These merchants of illicit drugs mostly use vehicles to transport the illicit goods across the country and even beyond.” He added that he is aware that the union cooperates with the NDLEA, but would like the cooperation and relationship to continue with respect to tackling illicit drugs. In his response, Akinsanya promised to continue to sensitise stakeholders in the transportation business about the dangers of conveying illicit goods. “No member will do such again to make quick money, knowing that when the law catches up with the person, the end is not good,” he said. “Such persons will go to jail and the vehicle will be forfeited to the government.”
