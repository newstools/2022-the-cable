The meeting is fixed for March 16, 2022, and will be held at Sheraton Hotel and Towers in Abuja. “May I convey my warm greetings to you and through you to the honourable members of this hallowed chamber of the national assembly,” the letter reads. “After helpful and enlightening consultations with my family, traditional rulers, political associates and ordinary citizens, I believe it is appropriate that I contest for president of this country. “Indeed, I see this as my duty and my own moral obligation that you grant me the chance to address the honourable members of our party’s caucus and sympathisers in the house of representatives on March 16, 2022. “I make this request with the utmost sense of responsibility and humility because this assembly is unique as an important representative of our people at the national level. “It will be appropriate for me to establish a discourse with members regarding our political and policy ideas for the nation and how we can best bring to the people the security, progress and prosperity they do clearly deserve. I want to share my vision for the nation with the caucus members and to hear likewise from them. “Mr Speaker, to borrow the words of our honourable members, I respectively move that you grant me this humble but important request. I thank you and our honourable members in advance for accepting to meet with me to discuss the future of our nation.” The former Lagos governor has been traversing the country to meet stakeholders to seek their support for his presidential ambition.
