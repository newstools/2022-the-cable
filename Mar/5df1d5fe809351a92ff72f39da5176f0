He founded Public Policy Research and Analysis Centre (PPRAC), organisers of the annual Zik Prize in Leadership Awards. In 2018, the publisher launched a book titled — Saved for His Praise — wherein he chronicled how he survived an unknown illness that almost claimed his life. The former commissioner narrated how God restored his health when he had almost lost hope. “My case is a demonstration that the Lord is good all the time. When I started writing the book, my wife told me not to focus on vindication because it is only God that vindicates,” he had said. “The only reason I can be here is because I am favoured by God.”
