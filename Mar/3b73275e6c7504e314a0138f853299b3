On Tuesday, it was an evening of good food, music, dance, networking and great conversations when over 100 women in the corporate world, politics and entertainment industry converged for a boat concert organised by Funmi Olotu, senior special assistant (SSA) on state lotteries to Babajide Sanwo-Olu, governor of Lagos. The attendees, clad in white and blue, traversed the Lagos waterways in a high-capacity boat donated by the Lagos State Ferry Services (LAGFERRY) to enjoy the breeze of the waterways and discuss female participation in politics as part of the activities to mark the International Women’s Day. Among the influential women in attendance were Funke Akindele-Bello, Toke Makinwa, Kate Henshaw, Ini Edo, Adunni Ade, Latasha, Nikki Laoye, Morayo Brown and Lanre Dasilva, multi-award-winning fashion designer. Betty Irabor, founder and publisher of Genevieve Magazine, and Nkiru Olumide-Ojo, corporate communication guru, were also on board. In line with the global theme of the 2022 Women’s Day, Olotu said the concert was initiated to support efforts and advocacies aimed at achieving gender equality for a sustainable tomorrow. Olotu addressing the women “We have seen gender policies and legislations being passed at the highest law-making body in our country which do not truly represent what women want and deserve. It shows that womenfolk do not have people propagating their ideals and demands in line with our expectations. This is the reason we need to come together and forge a common front in pushing for what truly belongs to us,” Olotu said. “Even in the development of our country, women have not rightfully been involved. We have seen women who publicly disapprove of politics as a dirty game. But that is the system used to decide our fate. For our country to move forward, we must get involved and work with the men to fashion out the right laws and policies that will support all citizens irrespective of their gender.” <img class="alignnone wp-image-673729 size-large" src="https://f5p3e9e4.stackpathcdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/WhatsApp-Image-2022-03-11-at-6.50.33-PM-1024x683.jpeg" alt="" width="900" height="600" srcset="https://f5p3e9e4.stackpathcdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/WhatsApp-Image-2022-03-11-at-6.50.33-PM-1024x683.jpeg 1024w, https://f5p3e9e4.stackpathcdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/WhatsApp-Image-2022-03-11-at-6.50.33-PM-300x200.jpeg 300w, https://f5p3e9e4.stackpathcdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/WhatsApp-Image-2022-03-11-at-6.50.33-PM-768x512.jpeg 768w, https://f5p3e9e4.stackpathcdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/WhatsApp-Image-2022-03-11-at-6.50.33-PM-24x16.jpeg 24w, https://f5p3e9e4.stackpathcdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/WhatsApp-Image-2022-03-11-at-6.50.33-PM-36x24.jpeg 36w, https://f5p3e9e4.stackpathcdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/WhatsApp-Image-2022-03-11-at-6.50.33-PM-48x32.jpeg 48w, https://f5p3e9e4.stackpathcdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/WhatsApp-Image-2022-03-11-at-6.50.33-PM.jpeg 1080w" sizes="(max-width: 900px) 100vw, 900px" /> In her speech, Olumide-Ojo emphasised why successful women must lift other women, saying the narrative that a man must be behind every woman who wants to attain their potential must stop. “It is not all women that believe they need to support their fellow gender. Only self-aware women support and lift other women. We all must be self-aware about issues that limit the potential of women. I charge every woman to tell their stories because another woman can find herself in it and get help. Women must also use their voices for other women by amplifying solutions to prejudices and abuses that hinder the growth of women,” Olumide-Ojo said. Irabor noted that for women to break every bias and prejudice limiting them, influential women must create inclusive platforms for other women to grow. “Insecurity, lack of confidence and living for external validation are the real biases facing women in modern times. Women must pay full attention to these issues and come together to shatter the barrier. We must be audacious and confident in seeking to break these biases,” Irabor said.
