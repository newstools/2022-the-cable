The national working committee (NWC) of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) has named a 25-member appeal panel to resolve issues on the party’s governorship primary in Osun. The panel is to consider appeals arising from the Osun state governorship primary conducted on Tuesday. The panel is scheduled to sit on Thursday at the party’s headquarters in Abuja. Iyorchia Ayu, national chairman of the party, will preside over the panel, with Samuel Anyanwu, PDP national secretary, serving as the secretary. Members of the panel include Umar Damagum, Taofeek Arapaja, Umar Bature, Setonji Koshoedo, Daniel Woyengikuro, and Ahmed Yayari. Others are Kamaldeen Ajibade, Debo Ologunagba, Daniel Okechukwu, Stella Effa-Attoe, Muhammed Suleiman, Olasoji Adagunodo, Ali Odefa and Dan Orbih. Also listed as members are Emmanuel Bovoa, Theophilus Shan, Aminu Abdullahi, Ngiji Ngele, Charles Akitoye, Umar Hadejia, Mike Oghiadohme, Suleiman Adokwe, and Aishatu Ahmed. The Osun PDP governorship primary, which held on Tuesday, was fraught with controversy as two factions of the party held separate elections on the same day. Ademola Adeleke was declared winner of the election backed by the NWC of the party, while Dotun Babayemi won the election organised by the Olagunsoye Oyinlola-backed faction.
