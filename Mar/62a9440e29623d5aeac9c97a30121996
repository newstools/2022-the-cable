Gbenga Omotosho, Lagos commissioner for information and strategy, says the state government will probe the use of petrol as a souvenir at a party. Videos showing the distribution of petrol-filled jerrycans in a ceremony elicited reactions on social media. The petrol souvenirs were said to have been distributed at an event organised to celebrate a chieftaincy title in Lagos on Friday. According to a statement issued on Saturday, Omotosho said that the state government is investigating the issue. He said there is no doubt that the action was dangerous and could lead to the loss of lives and property as it was against all safety measures in such places. According to him, the Lagos government, through the Safety Commission, is investigating the matter and would ensure that all parties involved in the condemnable act are made to account for it. “The safety of lives and property of Lagosians and visitors remain a top priority to the government,” NAN quoted Omotosho as saying. “We, therefore, advise that actions that can lead to loss of lives and property be avoided.” Over the past few weeks, Nigerians have been battling petrol scarcity, after the supply chain was disrupted due to the importation of methanol-blended petrol.
