Comfort Ayanwola, the mother of Oluwabamise, the late 22-year-old fashion designer, says she wants “true justice” for her daughter. TheCable had reported that Bamise was found dead on Monday — nine days after she was declared missing after she boarded a bus rapid transit (BRT) vehicle. Andrew Nice, the driver of the BRT bus which Bamise boarded, has been arrested by officers of the Department of State Services (DSS) in Ogun state. Speaking with journalists at her residence, the deceased’s mother, who hails from Ekiti, asked the Lagos and Ekiti governments to work together to ensure justice is served in the case of Bamise. “Oluwabamise, the daughter who the Lord gave me, boarded the Lagos government BRT bus and she has been declared dead. I can’t see her again,” she said in Yoruba while crying. “My desire is justice. I want true justice that will not be hindered by those in higher authority. “I am from Ekiti. I want the Ekiti state government to collaborate with the Lagos state government to get justice for me. I don’t have any influential person aside from God. “If not God that said it is time for him to be caught; the phone she was using before got spoilt. Before she got a new phone, I could barely hear her whenever she called me with her old phone. “She bought a new phone via payment by installment some days ago. Last Saturday made it 15 days since she bought the new phone. It was the phone she used to message her friend about happenings inside the BRT bus. “I want the Lagos state government and all Nigerians to stand for us to get justice. This is not the first time that BRT bus has been used to murder people. My daughter’s case brought everything out. “I heard it from the news that the BRT bus driver is saying this and that. He is being directed to say those things. He is the one who abducted and killed my daughter.”
