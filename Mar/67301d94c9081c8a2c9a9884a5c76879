The Nigerian National Petroleum Corporation (NNPC) says it distributed a total of 381.88 million litres of petroleum motor spirit (PMS) in a week. NNPC said this in its weekly evacuation report for February 21 to February 26, 2022. Last month, Nigerian Midstream and Downstream Petroleum Regulatory Authority (NMDPRA) had confirmed the importation of petrol with methanol quantities. The development caused long queues across major cities as many filling stations shut down services to contain the spread of adulterated petrol. According to the latest report, the distribution of PMS decreased by 1.4 percent compared to the total distribution of 387.59 million litres between February 14 to February 20, 2022. The oil firm said it recorded an average evacuation of 63.65 million litres daily — an increase of 14.6 percent from a total of 55.5 million litres daily average recorded in the previous week. “80 percent of all evacuation took place at the top 20 high-loading depots, while 20 percent of evacuation took place at other loading depots,” the report said. “On the top high-loading depot chart, Pinnacle-Lekki accounted for the highest evacuation at 43.2 million litres, AITEO accounted for 22.4 million litres, while AA Rano also evacuated a total of 22.4 million litres.” It added that Ardova Plc, Sobaz Nigeria Limited, and Mainland accounted for the lowest evacuation at 8.8 million litres, 8.9 million litres, and 8.8million litres, respectively.
