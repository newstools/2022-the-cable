A train on its way from Abuja to Kaduna was, on Monday, attacked by gunmen in Kateri-Rijana area of Kaduna state.

According to him, several passengers sustained injuries, while security operatives are currently conducting “rescue efforts”. “Security agencies have reported to the Kaduna State Government that the military has secured the Kaduna bound train from Abuja trapped by terrorists,” the statement reads. “The Kaduna State Government received multiple reports of an attack on the Abuja-Kaduna train service at around Kateri-Rijana general areas. “Relevant action agencies were urgently contacted, and robust deployments of personnel were swiftly made to the area to secure the passengers on board. “Efforts are ongoing to convey the passengers from the location and others that sustained injuries have been rushed to hospitals for urgent medical attention.” He added that the Kaduna government will work with the Nigerian Railway Corporation (NRC) to get a list of all passengers that were on the train in order to ensure that all persons are accounted for. “The Government of Kaduna State will be liaising with the Nigerian Railway Corporation (NRC) to ascertain the list from the passengers’ manifest for efficient tracking. This is to acquire an accurate inventory of all passengers and their actual status,” the statement reads. “Governor Nasir El-Rufa’i who has been in constant touch with the security forces, commended them for their prompt response, and thanked them for successfully securing the train and passengers on board. “Security forces continue to comb the general area in additional rescue efforts.
