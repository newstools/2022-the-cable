The United States Agency for International Development (USAID) says it will support Nigeria with $10.6 million development assistance for the goals outlined in a 2021 bilateral agreement between both governments. In a statement issued on Thursday, USAID said most of the new funding will finance boosting COVID-19 vaccination efforts to reach targets of 600,000 people a day. It added that the fund will support integrating COVID-19 vaccinations into routine immunisation and primary health care systems. USAID said the fund will also back state-level data collection and analytics, health worker training, and expansion of vaccination access points at the community level. Anne Patterson, USAID mission director, said: “Given the significant progress Nigeria has made, we are pleased to provide more funds to improve COVID-19 vaccine delivery services. “These new funds will deepen our support for all levels of government to meet their vaccination targets.” The organisation said the funding increases the total US assistance to Nigeria to $179 million under the five-year $2.1 billion development objectives assistance agreement.
