The Kaduna government says security operatives have discovered three more corpses following the recent attacks on communities in the state. Samuel Aruwan, Kaduna commissioner for internal security and home affairs, disclosed this in a statement on Wednesday. According to him, the three corpses were discovered in two LGAs. “Security agencies have reported that they have discovered three corpses of some citizens killed by a mob on Monday in two locations in both Kaura and Jema’a LGAs,” the statement reads. “The corpse picked around Kagoro Roundabout has been identified as the remains of one Ibrahim Isiyaku (Danasabe) of No 143, Bauchi Street, Kafanchan. “Two other corpses recovered at a location named ‘Binzom’ behind the Kafanchan campus of Kaduna State University (KASU) have also been identified as the remains of Malam Ibrahim Rilwanu and Malam Lawali Zubairu, both of No.5 Emir Road of Kafanchan. “This brings the total reported death toll from Sunday’s attacks and the ensuing violence to 37.” Aruwan added that the Fountain of Life Baptist Church in Kafanchan was attacked on Monday, while a bus belonging to the Baptist School of Health Technology in the same area was also vandalised. “The driver of the bus, one Mr Bamaiyi, sustained cutlass injuries and is receiving treatment in a clinic,” he said. In another development, two herders’ settlements in Zauru and Kurdan in Zangon Kataf LGA are also said to have been razed. Aruwan added that Nasir el-Rufai, governor of Kaduna, “received the reports with deep sadness, and sent condolences to the families of the victims, as he prayed for the repose of their souls”. El-Rufai also wished the injured driver a quick recovery, and “appealed to herders whose settlements were burnt to allow government and security agencies to handle the matter”.
