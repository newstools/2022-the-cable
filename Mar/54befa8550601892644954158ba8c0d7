Chieftains of the All Progressives Congress (APC) in Bauchi are unhappy about the decision of the ruling party to zone the office of the deputy national chairman (north) to Borno state. The ruling party will elect its national officers at a convention on Saturday. Ahead of the convention, the party zoned the office of deputy national chairman to the north-east. TheCable understands that position has been further micro-zoned to Borno state. Babagana Zulum, Borno governor, is said to have played a crucial role in ensuring that the position is zoned to his state. Abubakar Kyari, senator representing Borno north, has been reportedly picked for the position. At a meeting in Abuja on Monday night, chieftains of Bauchi APC consisting of serving senators from the state, some members of the house of representatives and former house of assembly members, agreed on the need for the party to treat Bauchi fairly — a matter they said they would take up with the party leadership. Although all Bauchi senators — Lawal Yahaya Gumau, Halliru Dauda Jika and Adamu Bulkachuwa — are in the APC, the state is led by the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) government of Bala Mohammed, the governor. “They want Kyari to resign from the senate and go to be the deputy national chairman (north) of the party,” a source privy to the meeting said. “The Bauchi APC chieftains are saying that there is a need to strengthen the party in the state so it can take over from the PDP in 2023. “They argue that Bauchi APC has contributed a lot to the success of the party.”
