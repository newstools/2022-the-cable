Muhammad Abubakar, Sultan of Sokoto, has asked Muslims to look out for the new moon — signalling the beginning of Ramadan — on Friday. The sultan said this in a statement issued on Thursday by Zubairu Usman-Ugwu, director of administration, Nigerian Supreme Council For Islamic Affairs. Ramadan is a time for reflection when Muslims around the world observe fasting for 29 or 30 days. According to the statement, if the moon is not sighted on Friday, the fast will begin on Sunday. “The Nigerian Supreme Council for Islamic Affairs (NSCIA), under the leadership of its President-General and Sultan of Sokoto, His Eminence Alh. Muhammad Sa’ad Abubakar, CFR, mni, felicitates with the entire Muslim Ummah on the auspicious occasion of the forthcoming 1443 AH Ramadan fast,” the statement reads. “The council prays that Allah spares the lives of every Muslim to participate in the ibaadah exercise and to maximise the benefits therein. “Consequent upon the advice of the National Moon Sighting Committee (NMSC), the President-General enjoins the Nigerian Muslim Ummah to search for the cresent of Ramadan 1443 AH immediately after sunset on Friday, April 1st, 2022, which is equivalent to 29th Sha’aban 1443 AH. “If the cresent moon is sighted by Muslims of impeccable character on the said evening, then His Eminence would declare Saturday, 2nd April, 2022, as the first day of Ramadan 1443 AH. “If, however, the cresent is not sighted that day, then, Sunday, 3rd April, 2022, automatically becomes the first of Ramadan, 1443 AH. “In the same vein, the Council enjoins all Muslims to be more prayerful unto Allah, especially in this month (Ramadan), to help our nation, the world in general and our leaders in particular to overcome the current challenges confronting the nation and the world.” The Islamic calendar follows the phases of the moon, known as the lunar cycle, falling nearly 10 days earlier every year in the Gregorian calendar.
