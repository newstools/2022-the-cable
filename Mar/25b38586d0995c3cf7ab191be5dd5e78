An image showing a train explosion has been circulated on social media platforms and widely attributed to the bomb attack on Abuja-Kaduna train. TheCable had reported that gunmen launched a deadly attack on a train at Kateri-Rijana area of Kaduna state, on Monday night. The gunmen were said to have blown up the rail track after which they launched an attack on the passengers. One of the images circulating online shows how two trains collided and sparked an explosion. Some social media users who posted the image attributed the incident to the Kaduna train attack without stating if the image was for mere illustration. Some news platforms also used the image as though it emanated from the Kaduna train attack. If Nigeria is a country that value the sanctity of life , #NGAGHA will be suspended in respect of those killed in terror attack on the Abuja-Kaduna train yesterday. We #Biafrans are saying, may the souls of those killed in that terror attack rest in peace.#FreeBiafra pic.twitter.com/c23Mf7ZV26 — Emeka Gift Official (@EmekaGift100) March 29, 2022  If Nigeria is a country that value the sanctity of life , #NGAGHA will be suspended in respect of those killed in terror attack on the Abuja-Kaduna train yesterday.

Results showed the image was from a train collision that happened in northern province of Semnan, Iran, on November 25, 2016. According to news reports, a moving train hit a stationary train which led to the death of over 36 people, while more than 95 others were injured. UK Guardian published a video of the train collision in Iran. VERDICT The viral image used to depict the Abuja-Kaduna train bomb attack is misleading. The incident in the image happened in Iran.
