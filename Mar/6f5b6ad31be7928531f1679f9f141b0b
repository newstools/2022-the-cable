Tanko Ishaya, the vice-chancellor of the University of Jos (UNIJOS), has assured the safety of participants for the Nigeria Universities Games (NUGA) in 2024. The VC’s assurance came on the back of the rights granted to the institution over the weekend to host the 27th edition of the games. It also came after the NUGA 2022 — hosted by the University of Lagos (UNILAG) — ended at the weekend. Ishaya, who expressed delight at the turn of events, said UNIJOS would provide state-of-the-art facilities ahead of the biennial games. “We have really longed for this rare opportunity and we want to commend everyone that has made it possible, especially the Chairman, Governing Council of the University of Jos, Prof Attahiru Jega, for his untiring support,” he said. According to the VC, the university authorities are determined to make NUGA 2024 memorable. “The facilities that we plan to install will gladden the hearts of athletes and officials and we will not spare any effort in ensuring this,” he also said. On the fear of insecurity in Plateau state, the vice-chancellor said: “Security has since ceased to be a big issue in our state. Nevertheless, we shall work with the state government to ensure that athletes and officials are safe before, during and after the competition. As an institution, we are conscious of security and will guarantee the safety of lives and property.”
