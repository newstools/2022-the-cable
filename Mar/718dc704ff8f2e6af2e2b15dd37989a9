The sub-committee set up to address appeals arising from the screening of aspirants for positions in the All Progressives Congress (APC) has fixed Friday for its meeting. The meeting was announced in a notice posted by the party on Thursday. The screening of aspirants, which held at the Katsina governor’s lodge in Abuja, is part of activities for the APC convention scheduled for March 26. Aminu Masari, Katsina governor, and Dimeji Bankole, a former lawmaker, served as chair and co-chair of the screening committee, respectively. While the screening of aspirants for national chairman and other positions of the national working committee (NWC) held on Tuesday, aspirants for zonal offices were screened on Wednesday. The screening appeal committee meeting, which will “attend to all appeal matters” will hold at the Imo governor’s lodge in Asokoro, Abuja at 12 noon. Members of the screening appeal committee include Hope Uzodimma (chairman) and Danjuma Adamu Dabo as secretary. It isn’t yet clear how many petitions have been received by the screening appeal committee. However, the Buharists Hang Out (BHO), a group, had written a petition to the screening committee asking that Betta Edu, Cross River commissioner for health, who is aspiring to the position of national woman leader, be disqualified. In the petition dated March 21, 2022, and signed by Uche Diala, BHO national coordinator, the group said though Edu is eligible to vie for any position in the party, her character had been called to question over a series of tweets she posted in 2020 supporting the #EndSARS campaign. However, in response, Edu said while she admits that the tweets may have been insensitive, she remains loyal to the APC.
