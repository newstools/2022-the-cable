Abdulrahman Abdulrazaq, governor of Kwara, has asked the national assembly to have a rethink on the rejected gender bills in order to make Nigeria’s political system gender-friendly. Abdulrazaq said this in a statement issued on Friday. TheCable had reported how senators and members of the house of representatives voted against bills seeking to amend the constitution to provide more opportunities for women in politics and governance. The bills rejected included a bill to create special seats for women in the national and state houses of assembly, as well as a bill to “provide reserve quota” for the appointment of women into government. Speaking on the development, the Kwara governor said such rejection doesn’t tell well on efforts to promote fair representation in governance. “I strongly lend my voice to appeals to the National Assembly to revisit the bills on affirmative action for women,” the statement reads. “The rejection of such progressive proposals pours cold water on the concerted efforts to have half of the human community fairly represented at the decision making table. “It is my hope that our lawmakers would be inspired by what we are doing in Kwara, have a rethink and help make our political system and the laws governing it truly participatory and gender friendly.” In 2021, Abdulrazaq gave assent to a gender inclusion bill in Kwara, making it possible for the state to have at least 35 percent women appointees in the executive council and other classes of political appointments.
