The Nigerian Railway Corporation (NRC) has suspended its Abuja-Kaduna train operations following an attack by gunmen on Monday night. The NRC announced its decision in a terse statement on Twitter on Tuesday. The attack occurred around Kateri-Rijana area of Kaduna on Thursday. The train was said to have almost reached Rigasa, its final stop. The gunmen were said to have blown up the rail track after which they launched an attack on the passengers. An unspecified number of passengers were said to have been injured during the attack. “The Kaduna State Government received multiple reports of an attack on the Abuja-Kaduna train service at around Kateri-Rijana general areas,” Samuel Aruwan, Kaduna commissioner for internal security, said. “Relevant action agencies were urgently contacted, and robust deployments of personnel were swiftly made to the area to secure the passengers on board.” In the tweet on Tuesday, the corporation said it was suspending its operations on the route because of “unforeseen circumstances”. The NRC said it would provide further information “in due course”. “Dear passengers, due to unforeseen circumstances, Train operations along the Abuja-Kaduna route have been temporarily suspended. Further Communication would be given in due course,” it tweeted. Dear passengers, due to unforeseen circumstances, Train operations along the Abuja-Kaduna route has been temporarily suspended.
