Several former Super Eagles players visited Bola Tinubu, a chieftain of the All Progressives Congress (APC), in Lagos on Saturday. Austine Okocha, Taribo West, Kanu Nwankwo, Obafemi Martins, Julius Aghahowa, and Victor Ikpeba were among the ex-footballers who visited the presidential aspirant. Tinubu announced their visit via his Twitter handle and thanked them for their service to the country. The ex-footballers are also organising a novelty football match to celebrate Tinubu’s 70th birthday.
