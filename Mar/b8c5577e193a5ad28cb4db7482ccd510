Executives of the FCT chapter of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) have thrown their weight behind the presidential ambition of Pius Anyim, a former secretary to the government of the federation (SGF). The endorsement was announced late on Thursday in Abuja when the party chieftains met with Anyim as part of his ongoing nationwide consultation on his political aspiration. In October, Anyim had said he will run for president in 2023 because “nothing stops anyone from south-east zone from contesting the presidency even if it is not zoned to it”. According to NAN, Anyim said he is fully aware of the socio-political and developmental needs of the FCT. The former SSG said his understanding of the FCT has positioned him as the presidential aspirant with the best ideas to tackle the problems of the city. He said he had lived all his working life in the FCT and had been part of the growth and development of the city. Anyim said he has clear ideas of how to tackle the challenges that had been plaguing the FCT, following the rapid growth witnessed in the city. “I am one of you. FCT is the landlord of Nigeria and I am one of you. When I completed my NYSC in Sokoto state in 1989, I moved down to Abuja and I have remained here to date,” Anyim said. “I, therefore, have the confidence as one of your own to ask for your support. Entrust me with the critical assignment to rebuild our dear country. I promise you that I will not fail you. “With your votes for me at the presidential primaries, you will be making a worthy and invaluable investment in building the Nigeria we and our children will be proud of. “Together, let us go for a greater Nigeria, where security, peace, unity, inclusiveness and prosperity will be our collective heritage.” Anyim also said he has a clear understanding of the problems facing Nigeria as a country and that he has the solutions to them.
