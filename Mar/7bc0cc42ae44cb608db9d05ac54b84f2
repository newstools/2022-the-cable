Residents of the Vom community in Vwang district in Jos south LGA of Plateau have reportedly clashed with troops of operation Safe Haven (OPSH) over the arrest of a suspected gunrunner in the area. Ishaku Takwa, media officer of OPSH, in a statement on Saturday, said the residents came out in their numbers to prevent the soldiers from accessing the community. He also said the residents threw stones and other dangerous objects at the troops. “Troops of OPSH, acting on credible intelligence, mobilised its personnel in the early hours of Saturday to effect the arrest of the suspected gunrunner and fabricator in Vom community,” he said. “Sadly, on sighting security personnel, members of the community came out en masse and barricaded the road leading to the community. “They prevented the troops from gaining access to the community to carry out their lawful duty. “All efforts to calm the crowd proved futile as they resorted to throwing stones and other dangerous objects at security personnel who kept their cool in the face of unwarranted provocation.” He added that to prevent the situation from degenerating into chaos, Ibrahim Ali, OPSH commander, ordered the immediate withdrawal of the troops from the community. “While we condemn the action of some members of the community who obstructed our troops from performing a lawful duty, we wish to remind the people about the consequences of preventing the arrest and harbouring criminal elements in their community,” he added. “No one should be in doubt that troops would certainly affect the arrest of any person or persons suspected to be involved in any unwholesome activity considered capable of truncating the peace and security of the state and the nation at large.” Takwa also warned residents of the state against obstructing security agencies from performing their lawful duties.
