Two people sustained injuries on Thursday after a tanker exploded on the Lagos-Ibadan expressway. Ahmed Umar, Ogun sector commander, Federal Road Safety Corps (FRSC), confirmed the incident in Abeokuta, the Ogun capital. Umar said the accident was caused as a result of brake failure, over-speeding and loss of control on the part of the tanker driver. It is not yet clear what kind of fuel the tanker was conveying. However, the Ogun sector commander said three vehicles were involved in the accident, including a Toyota Camry with registration number AAA 251 HE, and a Toyota Corolla with registration number LSD 828 GS, while the tanker was unregistered. “Rescue operation is still on to put the resultant fire under control,” he said. “Motorists are advised to drive cautiously and remain calm until the fire is extinguished.” The development comes less than a month after 17 persons were reportedly killed in a tanker fire incident on the same expressway. The incident, which occurred on February 18, involved a Mazda bus and a petrol tanker at Isara bridge.
