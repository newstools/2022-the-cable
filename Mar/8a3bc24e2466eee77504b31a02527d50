At least 14 worshippers were reportedly abducted in a mosque by gunmen after an attack in Giwa LGA of Kaduna state. According to Daily Trust, the armed gang raided the mosque during the evening prayers (Ishai prayer), on Thursday. “They surrounded the mosque and abducted 14 people. They also carted away an unspecified number of cattle from Tudun Amada village, still in Giwa,” a resident reportedly said. The gunmen were said to have been trying to invade the village, but the vigilante group in the area prevented them from gaining access. Speaking on the attack, another resident said: “The gunmen divided themselves, while some were operating at the mosque, others moved from house to house thereby abducting more than ten women. “Some of them were however busy carting away domestic animals such as cows, sheep and goats numbering hundreds.” However, as of Friday, four people had regained freedom. When contacted, Mohammed Jalinge,  the state police command’s public relations officer, said there will be feedback but he is yet to do so as of the time of filing this report.
