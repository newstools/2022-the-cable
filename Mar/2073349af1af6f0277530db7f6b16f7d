The Indigenous People of Biafra (IPOB) says it will support Charles Soludo, governor of Anambra if he will not persecute Biafra agitators. In a press release by Emma Powerful, IPOB’s spokesperson, the group advised Soludo to be wary of “selfish and evil politicians” working against the group. IPOB asked him to resist any advice to arrest, imprison or kill its members. “Our attention has been drawn to an encouraging statement by the new Governor of Anambra State, Professor Chukwuma Soludo, during his inauguration,” the statement reads. “We commend him for reasoning the way he did, but at the same time, we admonish him to be wary of wicked, selfish and evil politicians who never mean well for our people so as not to deceive him. “We, therefore, assure him of the full cooperation of Biafran youths in his efforts to secure Anambra State. IPOB will give him every support he needs to make Anambra the envy of the black race. “Anambra State governor professor Charles C.Soludo in other to succeed must not take seriously those or anyone whether part of his government or not that will advice him to arrest, imprison, and kill IPOB family members in Anambra State because if he listens to those criminal political harlots, that will be the beginning of his failure as a governor. “We are willing to support him as long as he will not turn to be a willing instrument in the hands of our oppressors to persecute our people, especially BIAFRA agitators. We wish him success in office.” The group further asked Soludo to not “repeat the mistakes of his predecessor Willie Obiano who allowed himself to be used by Fulani people to persecute our people”. IPOB added that they would support any governor from the south-south and south-east that does not “conspire with oppressors to perpetuate woes” in the region.
