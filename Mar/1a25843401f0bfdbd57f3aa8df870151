The National Emergency Management Agency (NEMA) says eight persons were killed in a communal clash between residents of Alesi community, Ikom LGA and Ochon community in Obubra LGA of Cross River state. Godwin Tepikor, south-south zonal coordinator of NEMA, confirmed the death toll during an on-the-spot assessment of the communal crisis in both communities on Saturday. Tepikor said the crisis, which occurred on March 7, broke out as a result of a land dispute between the two neighbouring communities. The Ochon people were allegedly trespassing into the farms owned by farmers in Alesi community and stealing their farm produce. The farmers from Alesi reportedly tried to resist the invasion but youths from Ochon were said to have attacked them, leading to the clash. The NEMA coordinator said no fewer than 2,008 persons were affected and had been displaced from their ancestral homes. “The crisis that erupted between Ochon and Alesi communities in Obubra and Ikom local government areas claimed the lives of eight persons, four were injured on both sides and over 2,008 displaced,” he said. “Several buildings and household property were destroyed in the process. “The affected persons were scattered amongst neighbouring communities within the local government areas of the state.”
