Gawat (@Mr_JAGs) March 5, 2022  Earlier, Gbenga Omotosho, the commissioner for information and strategy, had said the state government would probe the issue. He said the action was dangerous and could lead to the loss of lives and property as it was against all safety measures in such places. Omotosho said the safety commission would ensure that all parties involved in the distribution of the petrol are made to account for it. “The safety of lives and property of Lagosians and visitors remains a top priority to the government,” the commissioner had said “We, therefore, advise that actions that can lead to loss of lives and property be avoided.” Over the past few weeks, Nigerians have been battling petrol scarcity, after the supply chain was disrupted due to the importation of off-spec petrol.
