Mai Mala Buni, national chairman of the All Progressives Congress (APC) caretaker committee, has appointed Abdulrahman Abdulrazaq, governor of Kwara, to lead an eight-member zoning committee ahead of the party’s convention. The party will zone its national offices based on the committee’s report. March 26 is the date fixed by the party for its convention. In a statement on Wednesday, John Akpanudoedehe, national secretary of the APC caretaker committee, said the panel is expected to submit its report by Monday. “The committee is expected to submit its report on Monday, 7th March, 2022,” Akpanudoedehe said. The secretary also said Ovie Omo-Agege, deputy president of the senate, was appointed as the deputy chairman of the committee. Nkem Okeke, deputy governor of Anambra, is the secretary of the zoning panel, while Etim Nyong, M.B Shehu, Mustapha Salihu, Teslim Folarin, a serving senator, and Sadeeq Sule-Iko Sami are members of the committee. The development comes hours after the Progressive Governors’ Forum (PGF), which comprises governors elected on the platform of the APC, said there is no plan to postpone the convention. Speaking with state house correspondents after the governors met with President Muhammadu Buhari on Tuesday, Atiku Bagudu, PGF chairman, said they are working hard to ensure that the party elects its national officers. “We are working hard to ensure that on March 26, we have our convention and elect our national officers and that remains the case,” he had said.
