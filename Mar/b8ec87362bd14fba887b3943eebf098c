The caretaker/extraordinary convention planning committee (CECPC) of the All progressives Congress (APC) has released the timetable and guidelines for the national convention of the ruling party. The sale of forms for aspirants into elective positions commenced on Monday, March 14. According to the APC convention timetable, the sale of forms will last for four days. Screening of aspirants is expected to take place on March 19 while the highly anticipated convention will take place exactly a week later. Aspirants interested in the position of national chairman will purchase forms at the cost of N20 million. The form for deputy national chairmanship aspirants was pegged at N10 million while the form for the zonal chairman (national vice-chairmen) position and other offices will be sold for N5 million. According to the CECPC, female aspirants and physically challenged persons will pay only 50 percent of the prescribed fees for each position. TheCable had reported how Mai Mala Buni, governor of Yobe, had plotted to scuttle the APC’s convention and hold on to his position as the chairman of the party’s caretaker committee. Abubakar Sani Bello, governor of Niger state, has since taken charge of the party’s affairs, following the intervention of President Muhammadi Buhari.
