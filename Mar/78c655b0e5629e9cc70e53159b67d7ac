Ogiame Atuwatse III, the Olu of Warri, has hosted the second edition of the Ghigho Aghofen, otherwise known as “palace watch” festival for the Inorin community. The monarch initiated the palace watch festival last year to promote cordial relationships among himself and other communities that cannot access the palace due to logistics issues. Ghigho Aghofen promotes cordial relations between the Inorin community members and the Olu of Warri kingdom. Upon the assumption of their watch duty, members of the Inorin community brought to the fore their optimum game of dance, colour and tradition. Other cultural groups also paid homage to the Olu, amidst singing and glamour. According to sources at the Olu’s palace, the watch is staged to enable the communities to change guard every three months. “It means representative of each community will live in the palace for three months during which the palace would focus on the communities and solve their issues. This laudable initiative would afford the monarch opportunity to reach out to different communities,” the source said. It is believed that the legacy would last for the next fifty years or more, even as the rebirth of the Warri Kingdom is being regarded as a great change in the right direction. The first edition held on December 18, 2021.
