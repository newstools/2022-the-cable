The All Progressives Congress (APC) has just concluded its national convention where it elected officers to fill the positions in the party’s national working committee (NWC).

APC which was formed in 2013 is a merger of four political parties namely — Congress for Progressive Change (CPC), All Nigeria Peoples Party (ANPP), Action Congress of Nigeria (ACN) and a part of the All Progressives Grand Alliance (APGA).

Betta Edu, Cross River commissioner for health who defected to the ruling party in 2021, was declared winner of the position.
