Abubakar Aliyu, minister of power, is currently holding an emergency meeting with stakeholders in the power sector. The meeting is said to be about low power generation which has caused epileptic power supply across the country. In recent weeks, Nigerians have been feeling the pains of fuel scarcity and erratic power supply. On Monday, the national grid collapsed, causing blackouts across the country. The meeting has in attendance delegation from power generation companies, Transmission Company of Nigeria (TCN), Nigerian Bulk Electricity Trading (NBET), Niger Delta Power Holding Company (NDPHC), Nigerian National Petroleum Company Limited (NNPC), Shell and other stakeholders in the power value chain. Aliyu told stakeholders that they must work together to make electricity stable. “This meeting was summoned to address the current electricity situation in the country which we are not happy about,” the minister said. “We must find a solution so that Nigerians will have electricity. I want us to have the patience to talk to each other, not blaming each other.” Aliyu maintained that the federal government would not relent in its effort to ensure improvements in the power sector. The meeting, according to the minister, will find solutions to all challenges affecting power generation in Nigeria.
