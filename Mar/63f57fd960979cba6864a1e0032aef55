The Football College (TFC), Orile-Imo, Ogun state says it will next month organise a maiden scholars tryout programme for boys and girls of secondary schools aged 14 to 17 years. Babajide Kassim, the administrator and director of TFC, who is coordinating the programme, said it is designed to identify gifted student-athletes with a view to help them hone their talent. “It would also create for the students opportunity to further their education while still playing football, while we would use our contacts in the United States to get the selected students with required qualifications admitted to universities and colleges,” Kassim said. The coordinator also said interested students would be required to pay the sum of N12,000 at The Football College premises along Abeokuta/Sagamu express road, in addition to having proof of studentship and senior schools certificate examination before they would be allowed to participate in the programme, while scholastic aptitude test (SAT) would be an added advantage. The tryout programme is an initiative of Kasimawo Laloko, the late talent developer, former NFA technical director, and FIFA/CAF instructor on youth development. Endorsed by the Lagos state football association, the talent hunt would hold at the Legacy Pitch of the National Stadium, Surulere Lagos from April 12 to 14 at 8 am each day.
