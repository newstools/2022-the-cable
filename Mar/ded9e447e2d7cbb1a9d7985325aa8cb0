Adamu Adamu, the minister of education, has called on the West African Examinations Council (WAEC) to step up efforts in tackling the menace of exam malpractice in the country. Adamu spoke at the opening of the 70th annual council meeting of the examination body on Tuesday in Abuja. He said the “endemic phenomenon” has continued to pervade all sectors of the country’s educational system. The minister, who was represented by Chukwuemeka Nwajiuba, the minister of state for education, said there was a strong need for WAEC to make concerted efforts to stem the trend. “I want to make a strong appeal to not only the council but to all stakeholders to embark on concerted efforts to tackle this ugly trend,” he said. “I want to urge the management of the council not to rest on its oars in evolving strategies and initiatives that will check the ever-increasing menace of examination malpractice in the WASSCE.” Also speaking, Ato Essuman, chairman of the council, said malpractice has remained a huge source of concern. He said there is an urgent need for all stakeholders and sister exam bodies to come together to end the situation. “Inappropriate behaviours like cheating, bribery of results, the collaboration of teachers, and deployment of other means of technologies is a growing concern,” he said. “The earlier we begin to eradicate this, the better for us. Examination bodies should not be left alone to fight this menace because we can’t. “It has been revealed that some candidates use sophisticated gadgets concealed in glasses to obtain external assistance during examinations. “To eradicate this requires the collaboration of members government, with active support from member councils to address the ugly trend.”
