Ituah Ighodalo, senior pastor at Trinity House, says Nigeria needs “sincere and serious people” to occupy leadership positions. Ahead of the 2023 elections, there have been recurring debates on the quality of leaders who deserve to be elected into office. On Saturday, Big Tent — a coalition of political parties, civil society organisations convened by Pat Utomi, a former presidential candidate — held a town hall meeting in Lagos to discuss the way forward for the country. Speaking at the meeting, Ighodalo said Nigerians have complained enough about the state of the country, adding that it is time to move from words to actions. He said the country must look for the right kind of people, noting that Nigerians cannot afford to get it wrong. “We have spoken enough, it is time for Nigerians to move. We have complained enough, we are not complaining anymore. Nigeria is a great country,” he said. “All we are looking for now are serious and sincere people who are really interested in Nigeria to come forward and offer themselves to play a role in whatever capacity. “Some of us will run for offices, some will support, some will fund, finance, some will do the leg work. We will all work together. “We must look for the right kind of people, wherever they are, they may not have money that doesn’t matter, let them come and be part of this new government in Nigeria. “The year 2023 is very critical and Nigerians cannot afford to get it wrong. Every single sacrifice that we need to make individually and collectively to get it right, we must do it and get it right. Nigeria truly can be great. It has all the parameters to be great.”
