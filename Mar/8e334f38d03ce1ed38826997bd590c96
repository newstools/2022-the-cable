Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy has called for talks with Russia to end the ongoing war between the two countries. On February 24, Russian troops invaded Ukraine following a directive by President Vladimir Putin for what he described as a special military operation in the Donbas region. Russia’s invasion of Ukraine has resulted in hundreds of casualties from both sides, leading to the displacement of many people in the country. Amid the war, both countries have held negotiations that are yet to yield any major fruitful outcome. On March 16, Russia told Ukraine it was ready to halt military operations “in a moment” if it meets a list of its conditions. Dmitry Peskov, Kremlin’s spokesman, had said Moscow was demanding Ukraine to cease military action and amend its constitution to enshrine neutrality. Kremlin also said it should reject plans to enter any bloc, recognise Crimea as Russian territory, and the separatist republics of Donetsk and Lugansk as independent states. Speaking in a video released on Saturday, Zelenskyy said it is time to restore the territorial integrity and justice for Ukraine and its people. “We have always insisted on negotiations. We have offered dialogue, offered solutions for peace not just for 23 days of the invasion,” he said. “And I want everyone to hear me now, especially in Moscow. It is time to meet, time to talk. It is time to restore territorial integrity and justice for Ukraine.”
