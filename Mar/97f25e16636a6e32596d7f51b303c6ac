Thousands of youths under the umbrella of Rescue Nigeria Mission (RENMISS) have declared their support for Yahaya Bello, Kogi state governor, as the country’s next president in 2023. The youths who converged at the multi-purpose indoor sports hall in Bauchi, on Saturday, said the Kogi governor represents the voice of the youth in Nigeria. The youths also marched through major roads in the state capital, carrying banners and posters with different inscriptions announcing the presidential aspiration of the governor and expressing their readiness to support him. Speaking at the rally, Ahmad Damat, national president of the group, said it is time to jettison old ways of playing politics and show that a youthful president can create a Nigeria of everyone’s dreams. “We won’t mind the naysayers; we won’t mind those who have embarked on a campaign of calumny. We have worked with many leaders and assessed many across the length and breadth of Nigeria. Governor Yahaya Bello stands out,” Damat said. “All the lies they have peddled against him in the past have turned to strength for him and for us Nigerian youths. No retreat, no surrender, until we accomplish our aim, which is God’s will by His grace.” Abdulkareem Jamiu Asuku, chief of staff to the governor, assured the youths that his principal would heed their call and address them very soon. “You have been consistent in your call for His Excellency, Alhaji Yahaya Bello to contest for president come 2023,” Asuku said. “He has heard you clearly and will not disappoint you. He has demonstrated in Kogi that it is Youths O Clock, and it is paying off with all the giant strides. We will repeat the same feat for Nigeria by the grace of God.” He, however, warned the youths against engaging in political thuggery that could smear the good image and integrity of his principal.
