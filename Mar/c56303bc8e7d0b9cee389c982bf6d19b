The United Nations human rights office (OHCHR) says at least 847 civilians, including 64 children, have been killed in Ukraine between February 24 and March 18. Russian troops had invaded Ukraine on February 24, leading to casualties on both sides and the displacement of many people. According to the BBC, the number of casualties reported by the OHCHR shows an increase of 31 deaths compared to the previous daily update. The UN office said an additional 1,399 civilians, including 78 children, have been injured. “Most of the civilian casualties recorded were caused by the use of explosive weapons with a wide impact area, including shelling from heavy artillery and multiple-launch rocket systems, and missile and air strikes,” the OHCHR was quoted as saying. TheCable had earlier reported that Volodymyr Zelenskyy, Ukraine’s President, had called for talks with Russia to end the war. Speaking in a video released on Saturday, Zelenskyy said it is time to restore the territorial integrity and justice for Ukraine and its people. “We have always insisted on negotiations. We have offered dialogue, offered solutions for peace not just for 23 days of the invasion,” he said. “And I want everyone to hear me now, especially in Moscow. It is time to meet, time to talk. It is time to restore territorial integrity and justice for Ukraine.”
