The All Progressives Congress (APC) has reviewed the list for its national convention sub-committees. The party’s convention is scheduled for March 26. The reorganisation of the list comes hours after after Abubakar Sani Bello, Niger governor, took charge of the party. Mai Mala Buni, ousted APC caretaker committee chairman, was booted out after his “plot to scuttle” the convention came to light. Bello had said that the over 1000-member committees put in place by Buni was too much to organise the convention. The members of the new committees are 107, and the figure includes members of the caretaker panel who will serve as the central planning committee for the exercise. Excluding Buni, there are currently 12 members of the caretaker committee. The reorganisation sees Muhammad Badaru Abubakar, governor of Jigawa state, appointed as chair of the election committee at the convention. While inaugurating the sub-committees on Wednesday at the APC national secretariat in Abuja, the Niger governor said the party could not accommodate many members on the panels. “We task you to exhibit these qualities to ensure the success of the national convention. I know a lot of our party faithful wanted in one way or the other to serve in various committees as their support or contributions towards a healthy party,” Bello said. “However, we must be mindful that we cannot accommodate everyone in the sub-committees. “So, we trimmed down the number to a workable size without undermining everyone and I think this decision is the best for our party.” Click here to see the full list of the committees.
