Augustine Eguavoen, Super Eagles of Nigeria technical adviser, has named a strong starting lineup for the 2022 FIFA World Cup playoff game against Ghana. Nigeria and Ghana will slug it out at the 40,000–capacity Baba Yara Stadium in Kumasi tonight — where both teams will battle for the ticket to Qatar. In the attack, Victor Osimhen will lead from the centre with Samuel Chukwueze and Moses Simon to support him from both flanks. Kelechi Iheanacho will be the attacking midfielder while Joe Aribo is accompanied by FC Lorient Innocent Bonke, who is making his debut for the squad, in the central midfield. With Maduka Okoye out due to COVID-19, Francis Uzoho is the first choice goalkeeper while Ola Aina and Zaidu Sanusi will take on the right and left-back positions respectively, with William Troost-Ekong and Leon Balogun in the central defense. The return leg is scheduled to take place at the Moshood Abiola National Stadium on Tuesday.
