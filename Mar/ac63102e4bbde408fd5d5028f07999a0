Organisers of the annual Ondo auto rally say the 5th edition of the multi-event car racing show will hold from April 16 to 17 at Akure and Ilara-Imokin in the state. Speaking on Sunday, Adeoye Ojuoko, president of Work and Play, the group organising the event, also said the show has received a number of endorsements, especially from the host state government, in addition to new partnerships that would be unveiled before the event gets underway. “The reception for this year’s rally has been unprecedented. The state government and all its arms have supported us and this goes to show the interest that the rally has generated since it debuted five years ago,” Ojuoko said. “The rally has become one of the top tourist events on the Ondo State calendar and we have had people join us from virtually all the geo-political zones of Nigeria. It has also risen to become a major rallying point for the auto racers in the country.” According to Ojuoko, the highest safety measures are being put in place to ensure a hitch-free event as the Nigerian Police Force (NPF), the Federal Road Safety Corps (FRSC), and the Amotekun have assured of their full involvement. Participants have also committed to best racing practices, including standard procedures and checks for all participating persons and vehicles, even as the organisers have signed for health and safety policy as well as special insurance coverage for participants and their valuables. The opening day would feature an on-road race to be flagged off at the government house, Alagbaka in Akure while the off-road race would be staged at the specially built off-road tracks at the Smokin Hills Golf Resort at Ilara-Imokin. More than 60 racers from different clubs across the country have signed up to participate while the race winners will get cash prizes. Other activities like drifting, treasure hunt, and archery have all been included to keep guests and friends entertained on the sideline.
