The Nigerian Upstream Petroleum Regulatory Commission (NUPRC) says it is upgrading and deploying the National Production Monitoring System (NPMS) facility toward curbing crude oil theft. Gbenga Komolafe, chief executive officer (CEO) of NUPRC, said this at a gathering in Abuja while speaking on efforts by the commission to address the menace of crude oil theft. Paul Osu, NUPRC’s spokesperson, quoted the CEO as saying in a statement on Wednesday. According to the statement, Komolafe said the deployment of NPMS was being carried out in collaboration with other relevant agencies. NPMS is an electronic system used in monitoring oil and gas production in Nigeria. Komolafe restated that the system will ensure accurate and reliable reporting of crude oil production, noting that the National Data Repository (NDR) within the NUPRC serves as the data warehouse for Nigeria’s oil and gas industry. “The value of information (VOI) is for purpose of oil and gas investment decision,” he said. “For example, NDR facilitates data for bid rounds in line with the statutory mandates of the NUPRC under the PIA to prospective investors, thus enabling informed investment decision and shortening upstream business lifecycles.” According to him, NUPRC had considered technological advancements in its work processes. He said the technological adaptation unit (TAU) within the engineering and standards department engages service providers on new technologies that could be implemented in the petroleum industry. He added that the commission had also established more data-related initiatives in the NDR, such as National Improved Oil Recovery Centre (NIORC). “This focuses on utilising big data to drive a reduction in cost per barrel,” he said. “Also, the Integrated Data Mining and Analytics Centre (IDMAC) was set up to assess and analyse data for informed business decisions.”
