Gunmen on Wednesday attacked and killed two officers of the Nigerian Correctional Service (NCS) in Imo state. According to NAN, the officers were on patrol in Okigwe town when they were attacked. An eyewitness who pleaded anonymity said the officers, who are yet to be identified, were part of a joint security task force team in the area. The source added that the officers took off from Owerri in two Hilux vans for the day’s job before the incident. “The attackers ambushed them and threw dynamites inside their vehicles,” the source was quoted as saying. “The two officers died on the spot while others were rushed to the hospital.” When contacted, Goodluck Uboegbulem, spokesman for the NCS, confirmed the incident but added that the service was yet to get a full report. Mike Abattam, the Imo state police spokesman, also confirmed the incident. Gunmen have in recent times attacked security agencies and their officers in the south-east. In February 2022, two officers attached to the Isu police division of Imo state were killed following an attack on the station by gunmen. The gunmen were said to have attacked the station with “petrol bombs and improvised explosive devices (IED)”, which led to the death of the two officers, while another officer sustained gunshot injury.
