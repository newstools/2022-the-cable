Nasiru Ahmed, a member of the All Progressives Congress (APC) in the house representatives, has called for the sacking of Babagana Monguno, national security adviser (NSA). Ahmed, from Kano, made the demand during a plenary session on Thursday while contributing to a motion on the recent killings in Kaduna state. He said since 2015 when President Muhammadu Buhari took over power, service chiefs have been changed but the national security adviser has not been replaced. He said all the security agencies are accountable to the national security adviser who has failed in his duty. “Do we have a national security adviser?” he asked. “Are we saying the army, the Nigerian navy, air force, police and DSS with all the training that they have had, with all the international training that they have gone to — they have gone to peacekeeping. That a ragtag army of 16 to 17 year-old-boys (bandits) is more powerful than them? “Mr. Speaker this madness has to stop. It simply has to stop. You travel by road you’re kidnapped; you go by train, you’re kidnapped, last week the airport was attacked by bandits; you sit at home you’re kidnapped, you send your children to school they are kidnapped. Mr. Speaker a few weeks ago somebody was kidnapped in a hospital. Where are you going to stay? You can be kidnapped right in this chamber. “What do we tell our people that elected us? Do we just fold our arms? I want to use this opportunity again and I am calling on the national security adviser — he must be removed.”
