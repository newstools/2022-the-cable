A Russian airstrike hit a maternity and children’s hospital in the Ukrainian city of Mariupol on Wednesday. Ukraine’s President Volodymyr Zelensky described the incident as an “atrocity”, adding that children are among those trapped in the wreckage of the destroyed building. At least 17 people are reported to be wounded, although the exact number of victims and casualties are not yet known. Zelensky called on NATO military alliance to declare a no-fly zone over Ukraine, accusing them of seeming to be “losing humanity”. “Direct strike of Russian troops at the maternity hospital. People, children are under the wreckage. Atrocity! How much longer will the world be an accomplice ignoring terror? Zelensky asked. “Close the sky right now! Stop the killings! You have power but you seem to be losing humanity.” Mariupol. Direct strike of Russian troops at the maternity hospital.  People, children are under the wreckage. Atrocity!

Reacting to the attack, Prime Minister Boris Johnson said the UK will hold Putin to account. “There are few things more depraved than targeting the vulnerable and defenceless. The UK is exploring more support for Ukraine to defend against airstrikes and we will hold Putin to account for his terrible crimes,” Johnson wrote on Twitter. On February 24, Russian troops invaded Ukraine after Vladimir Putin ordered a special military operation in Donbas, a separatist-held region in the country. Since the invasion, there have been casualties from both parties, leading many Ukrainians, including Nigerians, to flee to neighbouring countries.
