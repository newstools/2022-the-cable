A Lagos-Ibadan train, on Thursday, stopped abruptly after “running out of diesel”. According to a Twitter user, King Isaiah Obadore, who was reportedly on the train, the crew members said the train stopped moving because it had exhausted diesel. “Boarded Train from Ibadan to Lagos. We’re still stuck in the forest with unknown Chinese Men,” Obadore said. “They said fuel finished. What a beautiful country, Nigeria.” Boarded Train from Ibadan to Lagos.

I am not aware of it. I’ll find it about it and feed you back,” Yakubu told TheCable on the phone. On Tuesday, the price of automotive gas oil, also known as diesel, had hit N625 per litre in some fuel stations. TheCable had reported that the ex-depot price crossed N500/litre, causing fuel stations to adjust their pump prices to current realities. The development is due to scarcity of fuel amid supply disruptions occasioned by the Russia-Ukraine war.
