Adejoke Orelope-Adefulire, senior special assistant to the president on Sustainable Development Goals (OSSAP-SDGs), says including more women in leadership will help in achieving the SDGs on equality, development and peace. Orelope-Adefulire said this on Monday in a press statement to mark the International Day for Women held every March 8, annually. She said women need to have greater socio-economic and political empowerment, adding that Nigeria still lags behind in areas of gender equality. She appealed to lawmakers to endeavour to reconsider the rejected gender bills, saying priority needs to be given to activities aimed at advancing gender inclusion and balance. “In Nigeria, women make up a mere 3.8 percent representation in parliament, the lowest in Africa. Yet, greater involvement of women in decision-making will enhance the goals of equality, development, peace, advancement of Nigeria’s democracy and even acceleration of achievement of SDGs,” said Orelope-Adefulire. “Indeed, the presence of our First Lady, Mrs Aisha Buhari recently at plenary sessions of the National Assembly in support of proposed amendment in the 1999 Constitution geared at increasing the number of women legislators at the national and state levels is commendable as it is historic.  By her action, our lovely First Lady has again demonstrated her commitment to advancing the cause of women in every sphere of life. “I will therefore appeal to our lawmakers to compliment the historic visit by reconsidering the proposed amendments and pass them in a bid to further enhance women’s participation in governance in the country.”
