Abubakar Malami, attorney-general of the federation (AGF), says the federal government is considering all options following the senate’s rejection of President Muhammadu Buhari’s request on the Electoral Act, 2022. On February 25, Buhari signed the electoral act amendment bill into law and he asked the national assembly to delete clause 84(12), which he said disenfranchises political appointees. The president later sent a formal request to the national assembly seeking the removal of the clause. The contentious section reads: “No political appointee at any level shall be a voting delegate or be voted for at the convention or congress of any political party for the purpose of the nomination of candidates for any election.” Last Wednesday, the upper legislative chamber rejected the bill through a voice vote when it was tabled to be read a second time. Malami addressed the issue on Wednesday while responding to questions at the end of the federal executive council (FEC) meeting. He said the government has three options; make another request for reconsideration, approach the court, or accept the law as it is. Malami affirmed that while it is the responsibility of the lawmakers to legislate, the federal government will exploit all options available — if it becomes necessary. The attorney-general said the federal government is yet to take a conclusive stand on the direction of its eventual decision. Malami also spoke on the case of Abba Kyari, the suspended deputy commissioner of police (DCP) who is facing drug-related charges. He said the extradition request by the US is still being processed while lamenting the misconceptions surrounding the case. The US had requested the extradition of Kyari over his alleged link to Ramon Abbas, the self-confessed international fraudster better known as Hushpuppi.
