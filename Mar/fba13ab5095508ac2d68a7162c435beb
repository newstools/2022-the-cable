Sunday Dare, minister of youth and sports, says President Muhammadu Buhari is committed to implementing life-changing programmes for youths in the country. Dare spoke on Tuesday at the Public Service Institute of Nigeria (PSIN) while flagging off a three-day capacity-building workshop. The workshop was organised by the ministry of youth, non-governmental organisations (NGOs), and voluntary youth-serving organisations (VYOs) for the effective implementation of the National Youth Policy (NYP). Dare, who was represented by Ismaila Abubakar, the ministry’s permanent secretary, described the Buhari-led administration as a youth-focused and friendly government. “Efforts are being put in place to create a synergy between institutions of government and stakeholders in the youth sector so that issues relating to the youth are mainstreamed into activities of government with a view to giving the youth a sense of belonging towards becoming productive and contributing partners to the overall development of the country,” he said. Dare also said the workshop is aimed at coordinating and assessing the implementation of the NYP in the wake of rising NGOs and VYOs in the country. “This workshop will focus at improving your capacity, bringing you together for proper revalidation, coordination and synergy while exposing you to the guidelines and criteria required for proper registration and recognition by the ministry in line with the provision of the National Youth Policy and other instruments on youth development which recognize the very important role you, the NGOs and VYOs have to play as partners in the implementations of the policy,” he added. Dare expressed confidence that the workshop would engender strategies for a well-coordinated and enhanced roadmap for the NYP (2019-2023) implementation that would meet the yearnings of Nigerian youths.
