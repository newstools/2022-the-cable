The Kaduna government says it has relaxed the 24-hour curfew imposed on Kaura and Jema’a LGAs of the state. Samuel Aruwan, Kaduna commissioner for internal security and home affairs, announced the development on Thursday. TheCable had reported that the Kaduna government declared 24-hour curfew in Jema’a and Kaura LGAs over security concerns. There had been recent attacks on communities in the affected LGAs, leading to the killing of over 30 people. Speaking on the decision to relax the curfew, Aruwan said the curfew will now be observed from 6pm to 6am daily. “The decision to relax the curfew hours from 6pm to 6am was reached after a review of the security situation presented by security agencies at a peace engagement,” he said. “By this development, there will be movement in the areas from 6am to 6pm, while the curfew is to be observed from 6pm to 6am daily. “The government wishes to reiterate that the initial declaration of the 24-hour curfew was to avert escalation of violence. Monitoring of the situation will continue. *Should security assessments necessitate it, the government will not hesitate to revert to a 24-hour curfew.”
