The Kaduna state government says eight bodies have so far been recovered from the scene of the Abuja-Kaduna train attack. The train was ambushed by gunmen on Monday night while it was a few minutes away from the Kaduna station. Earlier on Tuesday, Lucky Irabor, chief of defence staff, had said “seven Nigerians were killed, 29 others wounded and some were kidnapped, and we are yet to establish the exact number”. But in another statement, Samuel Aruwan, Kaduna commissioner for internal security and home affairs, said 362 passengers boarded the train according to the manifest. He said search operations are ongoing as several people are still unaccounted for. “The Kaduna state government has received from the Nigerian Railway Corporation (NRC), the detailed passenger manifest for the Abuja-Kaduna train service AK9 which was attacked by terrorists on Monday,” he said. “According to the documents received, 398 passengers bought tickets for the trip, but 362 were validated as having boarded the train through the recognised turnstile. “The passenger manifest does not include NRC staff and security officials who were on board. “Furthermore, security agencies have reported that eight bodies were recovered and 26 perons injured during the attack. “Investigations are still ongoing to ascertain the status of the passengers who were on board the train and remain unaccounted for at the time of this update.
