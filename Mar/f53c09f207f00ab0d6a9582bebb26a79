Confirming the development in a telephone interview with TheCable, Amina Salami, the airport manager, denied reports that travellers were held hostage. According to her, the gunmen fired shots into the runway from the fence area. “The Azman flight had long taken off at the time the bandits started shooting. In fact, the Azman flight may have forgotten that they came to Kaduna at the time,” she said. “It wasn’t clear whether they wanted to come into the airport, but they shot a security guard on runway 05. Unfortunately, on their way to the hospital, he died. “I don’t know whether they wanted to come to the airport. Unfortunately, they shot at the runway and the bullet hit the security guard on the head. “But the two flights we had had taken off. There are military personnel in the airport and they gave it to the terrorists. “They seized some of their motorcycles. The military succeeded in chasing them away.”
