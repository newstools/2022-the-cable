The Nigerian Army says troops of operation Desert Sanity have rescued 30 persons kidnapped by insurgents in Borno state. According to a statement issued by the army on Friday, the victims were found during military operations in Ndufu and Musiri villages in the state. Several insurgents were also said to have been killed, while various camps housing the insurgents were destroyed. “Ongoing offensive onslaught by troops of Operation Desert Sanity records another feat as troops neutralised several ISWAP/Boko Haram terrorists around Ndufu and Musiri villages in Borno State,” the statement reads. “Also, troops recovered weapons and rescued 30 kidnapped local residents. “Additionally, troops also destroyed various camps of the terrorists. Clearance operation is still ongoing.” The development comes amid several military operations in Borno as well as clashes between fighters of the Islamic State in West Africa (ISWAP) and members of the Boko Haram sect. About nine insurgents were reportedly killed on March 8, when Boko Haram fighters clashed with ISWAP fighters in Borno. Hours before the March 8 incident, troops of operation Hadin Kai killed 17 Boko Haram members in Damasak, Mobbar LGA of Borno. Meanwhile, on March 16, ISWAP fighters were said to have kidnapped Bulama Geidam, a health worker with General Hospital, Gubio, Borno state, after the insurgents attacked the town and looted food items and fuel from a humanitarian truck.
