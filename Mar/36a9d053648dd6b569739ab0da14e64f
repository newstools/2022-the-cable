Sunday Adeyemo, a youth leader better known as Sunday Igboho, has been reportedly released from custody in Benin Republic. In July 2021, Igboho was arrested in Cotonou, Benin Republic over alleged falsification of his passport. Prior to his arrest, the Department of State Services (DSS) had declared him wanted for allegedly stockpiling weapons in his residence. Yomi Alliyu, counsel to Igboho, confirmed the release of the youth leader. “I am to inform you that Chief Sunday Adeyemo, a.k.a. Igboho Oosa, has been released from prison to his medical practitioners under the agreement that he should not leave the medical centre or Cotonou for any reason,” Alliyu said. “Praises should be given to two prominent Yoruba personalities to wit Prof Wole Soyinka and Prof Akintoye for this turnaround in our client’s matter.” Also announcing the release of Igboho in a statement issued on Monday, Maxwell Adeleye, spokesperson of Ilana Omo Odua, said Igboho was released to Banji Akintoye, leader of the group. “The activist was released on Monday to a Yoruba leader and leader of the umbrella body of Yoruba self-determination groups, Ilana Omo Oodua Worldwide, Professor Banji Akintoye and a French language expert/Deputy Alana of Ilana Omo Oodua Worldwide, Professor Wale Adeniran,” the statement reads.
