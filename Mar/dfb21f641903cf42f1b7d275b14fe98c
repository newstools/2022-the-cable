Liverpool defeated West Ham United thanks to a first half strike from Sadio Mane in their English Premier League (EPL) encounter at Anfield on Saturday evening. Fresh from winning the Carabao Cup in dramatic fashion last weekend, the title chasers found their rhythm early and Mane made the visitors pay for a sloppy start. Mohamed Salah and Luiz Diaz should have given Liverpool an early lead but Mane ensured the fans had a reason to celebrate, with the Senegal striker dispatching Trent Alexander-Arnold’s cross into the net. West Ham would waste chances to level through Pablo Fournals and Manuel Lanzini, and Liverpool were equally culpable in the second period, as the electric Diaz failed to find the net from promising openings. The win moved Liverpool three points behind Manchester City, the table toppers, who face Man United in a derby on Sunday. Earlier in the day, Chelsea scored four second half goals to defeat relegation-threatened Burnley and tighten their grip on the third position. Newcastle continued their renaissance thanks to a 2-1 victory over Brighton & Hove Albion, their third straight league win. RESULTS Leicester City 1-0 Leeds United
