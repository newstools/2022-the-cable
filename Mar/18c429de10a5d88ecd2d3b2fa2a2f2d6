A soldier with the Nigerian army’s operation Hadin Kai in Borno killed seven civilians on Wednesday, sources have told TheCable. The soldier, whose post is in Mafa LGA of the state, was said to have been under the influence of “psychotropic substances”. According to sources, the soldier, without provocation, opened fire on the residents of Mafa town. The fatalities included a three-year-old girl, while 16 other persons sustained gunshot wounds. “The lifeless bodies of three persons are at Mafa presently, while many people sustained gunshot wounds,” a witness said. About 13 civilians are said to be currently receiving treatment following gunshot injuries. According to witnesses, some of the victims were at a wedding ceremony, while seven others were travelling to Gamboru-Ngala from Maiduguri, and had briefly stopped over in Mafa. Onyema Nwachukwu, army spokesperson, was not immediately available to comment on the incident. TheCable, however, understands that the military authorities have disarmed and arrested the soldier. There have been a couple of instances in which soldiers serving in the north-east opened fire on civilians or their colleagues. In 2017, a soldier was sentenced to death over the alleged murder of five civilians in Borno. In 2020, a soldier killed his superior who refused to give him a pass to visit his family.
