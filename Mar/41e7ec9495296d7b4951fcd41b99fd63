There is heavy security presence around the All Progressives Congress (APC) national secretariat in the federal capital territory (FCT). No official explanation has been given by the party for the heavy security presence at the secretariat, but there is the rumour that it is a move to oust Mai Mala Buni, national chairman of the APC caretaker committee. However, the party has refuted the claim. In a statement on Monday, John Akpanudoedehe, national secretary of the caretaker committee, said Buni is still in charge of the party. “Our attention has been drawn to sponsored media reports on an imaginary leadership change in the All Progressives Congress (APC) Caretaker/Extraordinary Convention Planning Committee (CECPC),” Akpanudoedehe said. “The media report is fake news and should be disregarded. “The APC is a progressive political party guided by rules. Leadership changes are not announced by ‘sources’ through name dropping in the media. “We urge our teeming supporters, members and indeed the general public to remain calm and support the Governor Mai Mala Buni-led APC CECPC conduct a rancour-free and credible National Convention deserving of our great party.” Buni has been in charge of the ruling party since June 2020 when the national working committee (NWC) led by Adams Oshiomhole, former national chairman, was sacked by the party’s national executive committee (NEC).
