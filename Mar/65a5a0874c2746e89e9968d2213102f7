A newly established Nigerian airline says it is recruiting professionals to fill up diverse roles in the organisation. The airline said it is in the last phase of obtaining its air operator certificate (AOC). More than 40 positions are available for interested and qualified candidates in Lagos, Abuja, and Kano states. Some of the roles include; captain, lead cabin crew, junior cabin crew, customer service officers, emergency response officers, administrative officers, human resource manager, IT specialist, and station manager. Other positions include: store officers, aviation security manager, aviation security personnel, head of maintenance, operations control manager, director of maintenance, ticketing and reservation supervisors, procurement officers, quality and safety inspector (engineering), quality and safety inspector (operations). All qualified and interested candidates can e-mail their resumes and applications as one document, to airlinerecruiteer@gmail.com on or before April 23, 2022, with the subject of the mail being the position applied for. The federal government is currently planning to launch its national carrier— Nigeria Air — and the proposed airline is expected to take off by April 2022. But it is unclear which of the airlines is recruiting as the advertorial did not mention any name. More information about positions and qualifications can be found in THISDAY newspaper of March 31, 2022.
