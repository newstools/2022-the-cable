The Nigeria Police Force (NPF) has suspended Helen Odemwingie, the chairperson of the police community relations committee (PCRC) for Edo command, over “illegal use of police uniform”. Muyiwa Adejobi, force spokesperson, announced the development in a statement on Wednesday. According to the statement, Odemwingie and other members of the Edo PCRC were seen wearing uniforms similar to that of the NPF. “The suspension is coming on the heels of a trending picture of the PCRC chairperson and other members at a function held at the Edo state police command wherein the PCRC members were seen wearing black uniforms similar to that of the Nigeria Police Force, with accompanying insignias and various inscriptions,” the statement reads. “It has been noted that the act contravenes the provisions of section 214(1) of the 1999 Constitution of the Federal Republic of Nigeria, 1999 (as amended) and section 101 of the Police Act, 2020. “In line with the extant law, the IGP hereby warns that henceforth, any individual who adorns themselves illegally in police uniforms, would be made to face the full wrath of the law. “Similarly, the IGP has ordered the police disciplinary units, particularly the Force Provost Marshal, the IGP X-Squad and monitoring unit to clamp down on persons who engage in the illegal sales of police uniforms, kits and accoutrements, outside of police approved stores and the office of the quartermaster.” PCRC is a community-oriented organisation established by the police to create partnerships between state commands and communities to enhance policing efforts. The organisation also provides support to the police in terms of information about crimes in the community. Meanwhile, the development comes days after the IGP ordered that every officer on patrol duty must wear the approved police uniform.
