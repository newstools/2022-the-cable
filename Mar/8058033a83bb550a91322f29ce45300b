The Middle Belt Progressive Forum has offered to purchase the expression of interest and nomination forms of any political party for former President Goodluck Jonathan should he decide to contest the presidential election in 2023. The former president has not yet indicated an interest in running for the presidency. In a statement issued on Tuesday, Paul Agada, convener of the forum, said Jonathan’s “rare” qualities have earned him the moniker “peacemaker”. Under Jonathan, Agada said, jobs were created for youths and the agricultural sector blossomed. “Dr. Goodluck Jonathan is a man of peace who has demonstrated in times past that he does not place his personal ambition over the peace and stability of the country,” he said. “This rare quality has seen him gain recognition as a peacemaker and key negotiator in conflicts across the African continent. “Jonathan is fondly remembered for the establishment of much needed Federal Universities in Lokoja and Lafia in Kogi and Nasarawa States respectively. Also, he approved the release of N30 billion from the Subsidy Reinvestment Programme fund to finance the Loko-Oweto Bridge project to link Benue and Nasarawa States, a project that has now been completed by the current administration. “The Middle Belt Progressive Forum has a robust membership spread across the states of the Middle Belt and the country at large and we have agreed that former President Goodluck Jonathan stands heads and shoulders in terms of experience and capacity above all the numerous aspirants jostling for the tickets of various parties hence our resolve to purchase the nomination form of whichever party he chooses. “We hereby urge him to heed the call of the Middle Belt Progressive Forum and teeming millions of Nigerians across the country and in the diaspora without further delay.”
