A federal high court in Abuja has fixed March 28 to decide whether or not to grant the bail request of Abba Kyari, suspended deputy commissioner of police (DCP). Kyari was on March 7, arraigned alongside Sunday J Ubia, Bawa James, Simon Agirigba and John Nuhu who are members of the police Intelligence Response Team (IRT). Others are Chibunna Patrick Umeibe and Emeka Alphonsus Ezenwanne — two alleged drug traffickers who were arrested at Akanu Ibiam International Airport, Enugu. In the charge marked FHC/ABJ/57/2022, the agency accused the defendants of conspiracy, obstruction and dealing in cocaine worth 17.55 kilograms. Upon arraignment, Kyari and four other defendants pleaded not guilty. However, the sixth and seventh defendants pleaded guilty and begged the court to “have mercy”. At the court session on Monday, Mahmoud Magaji, counsel representing Kyari and Ubia (second defendant), prayed the court to grant his clients bail. While counsel to the fourth and fifth defendants also prayed the court for bail on “liberal” terms, counsel to the third defendant asked that his application be taken on a later date. However, Joseph Sunday, prosecution counsel, opposed the bail applications. He said all the conditions for which the defendants should not be granted bail are inherent in the case. He therefore asked the court to exercise discretion on the defendants. Emeka Nwite, the trial judge, fixed March 28 for ruling on the bail application and also to hear submissions on the propriety of the facts of the case in respect to the sixth and seventh defendants.
