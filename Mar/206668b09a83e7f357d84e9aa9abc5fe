Aminu Tambuwal, governor of Sokoto state, has asked members of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) to put their differences aside and work together. Tambuwal, who is the chairman of the PDP Governors Forum, gave the advice on Monday night at the national caucus meeting of the party held in Abuja. The PDP crisis in Edo has snowballed into Nyesom Wike, Rivers governor, and his Edo counterpart, Godwin Obaseki, trading insults and accusations. The verbal brawl took a new dimension in the past days after Wike tongue-lashed Philip Shaibu, Edo deputy governor, for daring to threaten the PDP. Shaibu had appeared on a Channels Television programme where he said he and Obaseki may leave the PDP if the party continues to treat them as outcasts. The comment did not sit well with Wike who said the PDP gave Obaseki and Shaibu the party’s ticket when they were denied the same by the All Progressives Congress (APC) during the 2020 state election. In response, Obaseki defended his deputy and said Edo does not “accept political bullies and overlords”. The Rivers governor fired back on Monday, saying he regrets backing Obaseki in the 2020 governorship election. While addressing members of the party at the caucus meeting, Tambuwal who did not make a specific reference to the crisis in the party, said members should work in harmony towards the 2023 general election. “In the face of despondency, in the face of hopelessness, there are still rays of hope to turn PDP into the ruling party in Nigeria,” he said. “The by-elections have signalled what we shall expect to the glory of God in a matter of few months. “On this note, I appeal that we all as leaders and members of this great party bury our differences and work together harmoniously. We must send the right signal to Nigerians, that yes we are united and ready to rescue this country.”
