The All Progressive Congress (APC) says it will ensure adequate security during the party’s forthcoming convention. The convention is scheduled for March 26. Simon Lalong, governor of Plateau, said this on Friday after the committee responsible for the venue, decorations and site servicing visited Eagle Square, Abuja, the proposed venue for the convention. Speaking after the inspection, Lalong, the chairman of the committee, said the party would begin erecting structures for the convention. “We are preparing the venue for the convention,” NAN quoted him as saying. “There was science and technology exhibition which was concluded today, by tomorrow we will start putting our structures. “We want to ensure that the security inspects the place and to guarantee that there is adequate security for all delegates and everybody that is coming here.” Lalong stated that his committee is working with key stakeholders and organisations to ensure that the convention site and accompanying services were in place for delegates and officials. He stated that the committee is collaborating with the security and election committees to guarantee adequate delegate coordination and electoral processes. On Friday, federal capital territory (FCT) vacated an order stopping the national convention of APC from taking place.
