Faisal Shuaib, executive director of the National Primary Healthcare Development Agency (NPHCDA), says more than 11m Nigerians have been vaccinated against COVID-19. According to a statement issued by Laolu Akande, spokesman to Vice-President Yemi Osinbajo, Shuaib spoke on Thursday at the National Economic Council (NEC) meeting. The meeting was chaired by Osinbajo and had state governors, ministers and other senior government officials in attendance. Speaking at the meeting, Shuaib gave the council an update on COVID–19 vaccinations across the country. He said 11,309,080 Nigerians were now fully vaccinated, with five states —Nasarawa, Jigawa, Ogun, Kwara and the FCT — being the best performing states. He said the target was to achieve 50 percent vaccination, adding that some states have reached the target. According to the latest data published by the NPHCDA, 20,259,242 people have received the first dose of the COVID-19 vaccine as of March 20. The NPHCDA executive director said while 58 million doses are now being administered, 48 million doses are expected before the end of the year. He added that a website showing a state-by-state guide of how to locate vaccination centres and get vaccinated will be launched soon. The federal government began vaccinating Nigerians on March 5, 2021 after receiving 3.9 million doses of the AstraZeneca vaccine.
