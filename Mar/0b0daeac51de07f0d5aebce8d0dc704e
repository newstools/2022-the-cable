The Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) New Generation, a youth group in the opposition party, says the approach by President Muhammadu Buhari to tackling insecurity has failed. The Abuja-Kaduna train attack occurred around Kateri-Rijana area of Kaduna on Monday night. The train was said to have nearly reached Rigasa, its final stop when the gunmen struck. Some passengers were killed while others were wounded. In a statement by Audu Mahmood, director-general, and Dare Akinniyi, media director, the group said Nigerians are living in fear. It said the federal government is not proactive in handling the security issues bedevilling the country. “In not more than 48 Hours after attacking the Kaduna Airport, killing an aviation worker and injuring many; terrorists blew up Abuja-Kaduna Train with some 970 passengers onboard,” the statement reads. “There have been various accounts about how the terrorists might have succeeded in derailing the train, which reportedly left station in Abuja around 6:00pm yesterday. But it is evident that Nigerians are no longer safe in Nigeria under the APC. “It is crystal clear that the ruling party is dead and as such can’t do anything to save Nigerians. It is safe to say we are on autopilot. “The issue of insecurity has reached a point where the current strategies being adopted by the Buhari-led administration have failed and are in no way adequate to guarantee safety for all Nigerians. “The resurgence of killings and mayhem that have visited our roads, railways and airports in the last few weeks might have revealed a carelessness of leadership at the federal level in being proactive towards addressing justly reported cases of attacks and threats to lives and properties.”
