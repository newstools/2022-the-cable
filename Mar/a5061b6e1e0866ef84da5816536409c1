Paul Pogba, Manchester United midfielder, says his home was burgled while he was away on UEFA Champions League (UCL) duty on Tuesday evening. In a Twitter post on Wednesday, the French midfielder said he was informed about the incident a few minutes after the final whistle of the game against Atletico Madrid at Old Trafford. He also disclosed that Zulay, his wife, was in the stands for the game, while his two young children were at home sleeping during the burglary. pic.twitter.com/O3hocLUh51 — Paul Pogba (@paulpogba) March 16, 2022  “Last night our family’s worst nightmare was realized when our home was broken into and burglarized while our babies were sleeping in their bedroom,” the World Cup winner wrote. “The burglars were in our home for less than five minutes but in that time they took from us something more valuable than anything we had in our home… our sense of safety and security. “This occurred during the final minutes of last night’s match when they knew that we would not be home. My wife and I rushed home not knowing if our children were safe and unharmed. As a father there is no feeling worse in this world than not being there to protect your children and I sincerely hope that no one ever has to feel what I felt last night.” Pogba, a second-half substitute in Man United’s 1-0 loss to Atletico Madrid, also asked the public’s help in finding the culprits. “It is for this reason that I would like to offer a reward for anyone who has a clue to help us. Please send any info to rewardpogba@gmail.com,” the statement added. Pogba returned to Man United in a record deal in 2016 and, without a contract extension, looks set to leave the club in the summer on a free transfer.
