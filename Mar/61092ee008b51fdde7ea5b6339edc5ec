Amina Mohammed, deputy secretary-general of the United Nations (UN), has called on member states to intensify efforts towards achieving true and irreversible gender equality. Mohammed said this on Thursday while speaking virtually at an event hosted by Adebola Williams, a media entrepreneur, to commemorate International Women’s Day. Themed ‘An evening with African Power Girls’, attendees discussed the necessity of eliminating strains of inequality and gender bias across the continent. Speaking at the event, Mohammed said, “It is only with women and girls at the centre of our efforts that we have the best chance to succeed in addressing our current and pressing global challenges; from the climate emergency to gender-based violence, political divisions and to a sustainable recovery from this global pandemic.” “The SDGs reflect the commitment made by member states in this region over the past forty years thanks to the efforts and sacrifices of women activists and feminist movements. “On this International Women’s Day, let’s recommit our energies to achieving true and irreversible gender inequality because we all benefit when women have the opportunity to lead and to rise for all.” Ruth Osime, Zain Asher, Jonathan Hawkins, Adebola Williams, Shaffy Bello, Tamara Adeyemi, Gbemi Shashore at ane event commemorating International Women’s Day in Lagos over the weekend. On her part, Lerato Molebatsi, non-executive director, Adrian Group, Kenya, said achieving all-round sustained development in society requires achieving parity in every stratum of every organisation – be it in government or private. “Women and men both have invaluable contributions to make that bear the unique imprints coloured by gender characteristics and tendencies,” she added. “Without these imprints, society is bound to be lopsided.”
