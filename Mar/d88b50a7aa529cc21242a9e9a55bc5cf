Two women were abducted on Wednesday during an attack in Galadima, Gonin Gora, a suburb in Kaduna metropolis. A resident of the area, who does not want to be named, confirmed the incident to TheCable. According to the resident, the gunmen invaded the community at about 1am. He said the gunmen, who were well-armed, operated freely for over an hour — and killed three persons before leaving. He said among those killed is one Gius Nengi, a staff of MotherCat construction company whose wife was abducted. The resident said one Aminu Bege and his son were also killed by the bandits. Mohammed Jalige, spokesman of the Kaduna state police command, could not be reached as he did not respond to telephone calls when contacted. The incident is the second attack in Kaduna communities this week. TheCable reported on Tuesday how a catholic priest, a woman and two children were abducted by gunmen in Kudendan. Many residents in some of the suburbs within the Kaduna metropolis have relocated to safer places following frequent attacks by bandits.
