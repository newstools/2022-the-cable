Lucky Irabor, chief of defence staff, says seven people were killed, while 29 others sustained injuries in a train attack that occurred on Monday. The train, which took off from Abuja, was already in Kaduna but was yet to get to the station when it was attacked. Speaking with state house correspondents on Tuesday after a meeting with President Muhammadu Buhari, Irabor said security operatives are still trying to get the exact number of people who were kidnapped during the incident. “We have come to brief the president regarding the unfortunate incident of yesterday, when some criminals, bandits laid improvised explosive devices on the rail tracks and a passenger train was demobilised,” he said, “Seven Nigerians were killed, 29 others wounded, and some were kidnapped, and we are yet to establish the exact number. “We went to the scene this morning, inspected the entire area and gave out instructions on what is to be done and we have come to brief the president on this development.” The defence chief added that security agencies will intensify efforts to prevent a reoccurrence of the Monday attack. “The challenge of insecurity is a constant one and so the defence and security agencies need to be on their toes 24/7. This is unfortunate and we believe that the lessons out of this are what we need to build upon going forward,” he said, “I can perhaps use this opportunity and reassure the nation that based on the president’s directive, we will take every necessary action, not just to apprehend those behind this dastardly act, but for them to also face justice. “Going forward, certainly, there will be greater security for the nation and I will like to urge everybody to go about their normal duties.”
