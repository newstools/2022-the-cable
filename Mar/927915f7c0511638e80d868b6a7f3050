The United Kingdom (UK) says it will remove all remaining COVID-19 travel restrictions in place for foreign travellers, effective Friday, March 18. Grant Shapps, UK transport secretary, said the restrictions to be lifted includes the passenger locator form (PLF) for arrivals into the UK and all tests for passengers who do not qualify as vaccinated. Consequently, unvaccinated passengers will no longer be required to take a pre-departure test and a second-day post-arrival test. “The UK is leading the world in removing all remaining COVID-19 travel restrictions, and today’s announcement is a testament to the hard work everyone in this country has put in place to roll out the vaccine and protect each other,” Shapps said in a statement issued on Monday. “I said we wouldn’t keep travel measures in place for any longer than necessary, which we’re delivering on today – providing more welcome news and greater freedom for travellers ahead of the Easter holidays. “I look forward to continuing to work with the travel sector and partners around the world to keep international travel moving.” Sajid Javid, health and social care secretary, said the removal of the travel restrictions is down to the “incredible success” of the UK’s vaccination programme. “As we learn to live with COVID-19, we’re taking further steps to open up international travel once again ahead of the Easter holidays,” he said. “We will continue monitoring and tracking potential new variants and keep a reserve of measures that can be rapidly deployed if needed to keep us safe. “We can remove these final restrictions thanks to the incredible success of our vaccination programme, which has seen more than 8 out of 10 adults across the UK boosted.” The UK said it will, however, “maintain a range of contingency measures” so as to be able to take prompt action “to delay any future harmful variants of COVID-19 entering the UK should the need arise”.
