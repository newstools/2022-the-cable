Wilfred Ndidi has been replaced by Innocent Bonke for the World Cup qualification playoff clash against Ghana. The two-legged affair is billed to take place later this month in Kumasi and Abuja. The change in personnel was confirmed on the Super Eagles verified Twitter account on Sunday. Ndidi sustained a knee injury during Leicester City’s Europa Conference League game against Rennes at Roazhon Park on Thursday. The defensive midfielder limped off after a clumsy tackle by Rennes’ Gaetan Laborde in the 60th minute. While the extent of the injury is yet to be ascertained by the club’s doctor, Austin Eguavoen, Super Eagles technical adviser, has decided to call Bonke as a replacement for the all-important double-header. The 26-year-old Bonke made his debut for the Super Eagles against Cape Verde in 2021. The first leg of the World Cup qualifier will be held at the Baba Yara Stadium in Kumasi on March 25, while the second leg is billed for MKO Abiola National Stadium, Abuja, four days later. The Eagles are expected to start arriving at the Super Eagles camp in Abuja today.
