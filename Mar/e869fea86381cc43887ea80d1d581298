The Lagos state chapter of the All Progressives Congress (APC) has selected Dayo Israel as its consensus candidate for the position of APC national youth leader. According to a statement by Gboyega Akosile, the chapter’s spokesman, the decision was announced on Friday by Cornelius Ojelabi, the Lagos APC chairman, during a dinner organised by Babajide Sanwo-Olu, governor of Lagos, for party chieftains and delegates in Abuja. Ojelabi commended the delegates for travelling from Lagos for the convention, and appealed to members to ensure a smooth exercise. “We are determined to have a successful national convention to put in place a democratically-elected national working committee of APC for the next four years. The unity list would be provided as we proceed to the venue of the convention,” he said. “We have our person who is going to represent the good people of Lagos state in the national working committee. “We are presenting someone who is going to galvanise to ensure that the youths vote for our party in Lagos state and at the national level during the 2023 general election. He is Dayo Israel. “We are presenting him as the national youth leader. I want you all to canvass for him. He is a dynamic youth, who knows what it takes to mobilise and galvanise the youths to support our party. “I also want to present to you the zonal organising secretary, who is going to represent all of us at the south-west level. I have the honour to introduce Mr. Lateef Ibirogba, who will be contesting for the post of zonal organising secretary.” Speaking during the dinner, Sanwo-Olu expressed support for Israel and Ibirogba, adding that they would be good representatives of the Lagos APC chapter.
