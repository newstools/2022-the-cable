Operatives of the Department of State Security Services (DSS) have arrested Bashir Kutama and Faizu Alfindiki, LG chairmen of Gwarzo and Kano municipal area, respectively, over alleged use of armed thugs in the state. The development comes after a recent clash between supporters of two politicians believed to be interested in running for the position of Kano governor. Four persons were reportedly killed, while several others sustained injuries during the inauguration of officials of the APC for Kano southern senatorial zone in Rano. A source at the DSS Kano command, who spoke on the condition of anonymity, confirmed the arrest of the two LG chairmen. “Yes, they have arrested Mr Faizu Alfindiki, chairman of Kano municipal area, and Bashir Abdullahi Kutama, chairman of Gwarzo local government area, over allegations of sponsoring highly-placed political thuggery in the state, culminating in attacks and subsequent killings,” the source said. “The DSS has also placed Khalid Ishaq Diso, chairman of Gwale local government area, on the same allegations, while one adviser to the governor was also arrested by the security operatives on the same allegations. “The DSS has commenced serious moves to check the ugly trend, which if allowed to continue, could set Kano ablaze even before the commencement of the 2023 general election.” According to the source, the duo are currently undergoing interrogation.
