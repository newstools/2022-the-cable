Gunmen have set ablaze the Umuguma divisional police headquarters in Owerri west local LGA of Imo state. According to sources, the police station came under heavy attack for hours, with the gunmen shooting sporadically. A source who pleaded anonymity said the gunmen attacked the police station at about 3 am on Saturday, blowing it up with dynamite. He said the building, including cars in the vicinity, were razed. “It was really a terrible situation. Please be vigilant and stay secured and safe,” he said. Another witness, who identified himself as Okechukwu, said residents heard heavy explosives in successions and that one of their kinsmen was killed during the attack. “Nobody slept here,” he said. “We were scared to leave our homes, but we knew it was a heavy bombardment. Unfortunately, they killed our brother, Ifeanyi, who was trying to defend the station and his people by extension”. Okechukwu said the gunmen overwhelmed the security operatives during the attack. Micheal Abbatam, Imo police spokesperson, confirmed the attack to TheCable. He, however, said no life was lost, and firearms were not carted away by the assailants as claimed by the people. “Yes, there was an incident, but our men repelled them, no life was lost and neither did we lose any firearm,” Abbatam said. “They threw in dynamite which ignited the roof, but our men engaged them.”
