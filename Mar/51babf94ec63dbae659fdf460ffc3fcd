The zone 2 police command in Lagos says its operatives have arrested 11 suspects over the murder of Ayinde Odetola, the Olu of Agodo town in Ifo council area of Ogun state. Odetola was reportedly set ablaze inside his car around Ewekoro LGA. Speaking on the latest development in a statement issued on Monday, Hauwa Idris-Adamu, spokesperson of the zonal command, said the traditional ruler was killed over allegations arising on land ownership. “On Monday, Jan. 24, 2022, His Royal Highness, Oba Odetola Olajide Ayinde, the Olu of Agodo town in Ifo LGA. Ogun State, was murdered by one Gbeminyi Sotade ‘m’ aka okon and his cohorts,” the statement reads. “The late traditional ruler went to his village on a portion of land to clear the graveside of his late brother. “All of a sudden, a group of hoodlums numbering about 50, led by one Gbeminiyi Sotade ‘m’ attacked him while three of his relatives were assaulted and macheted. “The hoodlums pushed the traditional ruler into his red Toyota Sienna SUV 2016 model with registration number APP 55 GF, while one Agbara drove the vehicle in the company of other hoodlums to a nearby forest. “They poured petrol on him and the vehicle was finally set ablaze with the corpse locked in it.” Idris-Adamu added that three other persons with the deceased, identified as Alfa Wahab, Deborah Onilere and Lydia Odetola, “narrowly escaped death”. “Eleven suspects have so far been arrested and they have confessed to their involvements in the crime and when asked why they attacked and murdered the traditional ruler; they claimed he was a land grabber,” Idris-Adamu said. “Efforts are at top gear to arrest others who are still at large.” The zonal spokesperson urged the public to desist from taking laws into their hands, adding that the police will ensure that all the perpetrators are brought to book.
