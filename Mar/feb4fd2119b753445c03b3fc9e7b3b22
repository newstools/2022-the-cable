Gunmen have abducted Julius Osahon, a journalist with The Guardian newspaper, in Delta state. Osahan was said to have been kidnapped on Monday alongside 17 other people. According to NAN, a source said the victims were kidnapped on Monday evening on east-west road in Ewreni community in Ughelli north LGA of Delta. The source added that the gunmen shot the driver of the vehicle in which the abductees were travelling. “The gunmen have reportedly established contact with the journalist’s wife and are demanding N5 million for his release,” the source said. Meanwhile, Lucky Egboyi, one of the passengers who escaped the abduction, told journalists that they were returning from Bayelsa when they ran into the hoodlums who were operating on the road. “It was a narrow escape for me and a few others because we had to run into the bush,” he said. When TheCable contacted Bright Edafe, the Delta police spokesman, he confirmed the incident but said not up to 17 people were abducted. “The exact number of persons abducted was about seven. But right now, only four remain with the abductors including the journalist,” he said. “The command is making efforts to ensure the abducted persons regain their freedom and the perpetrators brought to book.”
