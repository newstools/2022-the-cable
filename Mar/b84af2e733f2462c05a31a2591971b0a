A Competition and Consumer Protection (CCP) tribunal sitting in Abuja has restrained MultiChoice Nigeria Limited from increasing its tariffs and cost of products and services. A three-member tribunal, presided over by Thomas Okosun, gave the order on Wednesday following an ex parte application moved by Festus Onifade, a legal practitioner, on behalf of himself and the coalition of Nigeria consumers. Other members of the tribunal include Sola Salako Ajulo and Ibrahim El-Yakubu. While MultiChoice Nigeria Limited is the first defendant, the Federal Competition and Consumer Protection Commission (FCCPC) is the second respondent. The suit marked CCPT/OP/1/2022 was filed on March 29. Onifade had prayed the court for “an order of interim injunction restraining the 1st defendants/respondents, either by itself, agents, representatives, officers or privies, howsoever described, from carrying out the impending increase in tariffs and cost of its products and services intended to take effect from April 1, 2022, until the hearing and determination of the motion on notice already filed before this tribunal. “An order of the honourable tribunal mandating the 1st defendant/respondents to maintain status quo pending the hearing and determination of the motion on notice. “And for such further order or other orders as this honourable tribunal may deem fit to make in the circumstance.” After hearing the motion ex parte, the tribunal granted the applicant’s prayers. The matter was adjourned to April 11 for the hearing and determination of the motion on notice. The tribunal also directed that all parties in the suit must appear before the tribunal on the next date. On Wednesday, the senate asked Multichoice to reduce the prices of its DStv and GOtv packages owing to the prevailing economic circumstances of the country.
