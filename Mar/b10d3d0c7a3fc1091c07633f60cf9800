Ayo Obe, an activist and lawyer, has tackled Femi Adesina, presidential spokesman, over his comment on the current scarcity of petrol in the country. In an article entitled ‘Knock, Knock. Who’s There’, Adesina said Nigerians have survived petrol shortages and “we will survive again. Las las”. “It’s obviously not the easiest of times in our country currently, with severe fuel scarcity exacerbating the other existential challenges we have been coping with. In some areas, there’s no fuel, no electricity, thus translating to severe energy crisis,” the presidential spokesman said. “There were cases of bad fuel before in this country. “We slept for days, weeks on end at petrol stations, queuing for fuel. We survived. We will survive again. Las las.” But reacting to Adesina’s comment in a tweet on Friday, Obe said Nigerians did not elect the government to preside over fuel shortages. The lawyer said petrol scarcity is on of the reasons the administration of former President Goodluck Jonathan was voted out of office. “Yes @FemAdesina we did. It was even worse,” she tweeted. “But that’s one of the reasons why the government responsible then was voted out. It wasn’t because Nigerians said: Let a different set of people preside over our fuel shortage.” Yes @FemAdesina we did. It was even worse.But that's one of the reasons why the government responsible then was voted out. It wasn't because Nigerians said: Let a different set of people preside over our fuel shortage. — Ayo Obe (@naijama) March 4, 2022
