Sunday Dare, minister of youth and sports development, has hailed Ese Brume for clinching a silver medal at the just-concluded World Athletics Indoor Championships in Belgrade, Serbia. Brume leapt a distance of 6.85m to finish in second in the long jump event behind Ivana Vuleta who won gold with a jump of 7.06m. The feat, which is Nigeria’s first podium finish at the indoor championships in 14 years, has continued to fetch her commendations. In a statement on Monday, the minister hailed Brume for her heroics and described her as “an epitome of humility and hardworrk.” Dare also urged the athlete to maintain her focus, discipline and determination so as to improve her performances in future competitions. “Ese won a bronze for Nigeria at the last Olympics and she has won a silver again. I am sure she will achieve gold in her next international competition for Nigeria,” he said. “We, as a ministry, are proud of her. She is an epitome of humility, hardwork and the Nigerian attitude that never gives up.” Ruth Usoro, another Nigerian athlete, also set her new personal season’s best with a leap of 6.69m to place eighth during the event which came to an end on Sunday.
