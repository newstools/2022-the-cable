President Muhammadu Buhari will depart Abuja on Tuesday to participate in the commemoration of the 50th anniversary of the United Nations Environmental Programme (UNEP@50). The event will take place from March 3 to 4 in Nairobi, Kenya. According to Femi Adesina, presidential spokesman, Buhari’s trip to Kenya is sequel to an invitation extended to him by Uhuru Kenyatta, his Kenyan counterpart. The theme of the special session is ‘Strengthening UNEP For The Implementation Of The Environmental Dimension Of The 2030 Agenda For Sustainable Development’. “For 50 years, UNEP has coordinated a worldwide effort with Member States to address the world’s biggest environmental challenges,” organisers of the event were quoted as saying. “Member States are vital partners in formulating UNEP’s policy, implementing UNEP’s programme, and championing solutions to our shared environmental challenges. “UNEP@50 is a time to reflect on the past and envision the future. “It provides an opportunity to reinvigorate international cooperation and spur collective action to address the triple planetary crisis of climate change, nature and biodiversity loss, and pollution and waste. No country or continent can solve these global crises alone. “But each nation has a crucial role to play in protecting our people and planet.” According to Adesina, Buhari is expected to deliver the national statement of the country and participate in high-level dialogue sessions on the environment at the event. He said the president will be accompanied by Geoffrey Onyeama, minister of foreign affairs; Sharon Ikeazor, minister of state for environment, and Babagana Monguno, national security adviser. Others are Ahmed Rufai, director-general of the National Intelligence Agency, and Abike Dabiri-Erewa, chairperson of the Nigerians in Diaspora Commission (NiDCOM). Adesina also said from Kenya, the president will proceed to London for “routine medical checks that will last for a maximum of two weeks”.
