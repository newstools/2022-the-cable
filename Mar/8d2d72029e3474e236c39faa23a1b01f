Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy has asked the United States Congress to do more to help his country fight Russia. Zelenskyy said Russian troops have fired nearly 1,000 missiles into Ukraine, adding that the country’s sky has been turned “into a source of death”. The Ukrainian president made an impassioned appeal for support to the US lawmakers on Wednesday when he addressed them virtually. “Russia has turned the Ukrainian sky into a source of death for thousands of people. Russian troops have already fired nearly 1,000 missiles at Ukraine, countless bombs,” he said. “They use drones to kill us with precision. This is a terror that Europe has not seen for 80 years, and we are asking for a reply, for an answer to this terror from the whole world.” The speech is coming at a time the US is under pressure to provide more military assistance to Ukraine as it seeks to repel Russia’s offensive. US PLEDGES $800M IN SECURITY ASSISTANCE Zelensky also requested defence systems from the US to enable Ukraine’s troops to defend the country in the air and on land. “You know what kind of defence systems we need, S-300 and other similar systems. You know how much depends on the battlefield on the ability to use aircraft, powerful, strong air — aviation to protect our people, our freedom, our land, aircraft that can help Ukraine, help Europe,” he said. “And you know that they exist, and you have them, but they are on earth, not in Ukraine — in the Ukrainian sky. They do not defend our people.” Hours later, US President Joe Biden announced an additional $800 million in security assistance to Ukraine. “The world is united in our support for Ukraine and our determination to make (Russian President Vladimir) Putin pay a very heavy price,” Biden said before signing a presidential memorandum at the White House.
