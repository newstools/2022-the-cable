Residents of Danmani community in Rigasa, Igabi LGA of Kaduna state, have sustained injuries following an explosion in the area. Samuel Aruwan, Kaduna commissioner for internal security and home affairs, confirmed the development in a statement on Saturday. The incident, which occurred on Friday, was said to have been caused by an improvised explosive device (IED) planted in a motorcycle belonging to one Mohammed Hassan, a POS operator in the area. “According to preliminary investigations, Hassan, at the close of work, went to pick up his motorcycle where it was parked close to the shop, and upon starting the motorcycle, it exploded,” the commissioner said. “The explosion resulted in serious injuries to Hassan and a yet-unidentified passer-by. There was also damage to the roof of a nearby structure.” A member of the vigilante group in the community, however, told TheCable that four persons sustained injuries in the incident. “The legs and fingernails of the POS operator were badly affected and he and three others were taken to the hospital,” the vigilante operative said. A police anti-bomb squad was, thereafter, deployed to the area, during which a second IED, also planted in a motorcycle, was discovered and defused. The development comes weeks after the Kaduna government warned residents to be on the alert for explosives that may be planted in public places. The warning, which was issued on February 28, followed the recovery of an object suspected to be an IED planted in a beer parlour located along the Nnamdi Azikiwe by-pass in the metropolis.
