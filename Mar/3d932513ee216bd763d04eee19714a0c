The senate and house of representatives, on Tuesday, voted on 68 bills seeking to amend the 1999 constitution. The voting on the bills were done simultaneously in both chambers. The red and green chambers agreed on some of the bills and differed on others. For example, while the senate voted against a bill to provide for an office of a mayor in the federal capital territory (FCT), the house of representatives approved the proposed legislation. Bills that pass in only one chamber will not make the list of those that will be sent to the state houses of assembly to be voted on. A total of 43 bills made the cut. Two-thirds of the state assemblies will have to pass the bills before it is now sent to the president for assent. Here is how both chambers of the national assembly voted.
