The Nigerian Army says troops of Operation Hadin Kai have killed 17 Boko Haram members in Damasak, Mobbar LGA of Borno. Damasak, the main town of Mobbar LGA, is near the confluence of the Yobe River and Komadugu Gana River, adjoining the border with Niger Republic. Christopher Musa, theatre commander of the operation, said the troops engaged a large number of the insurgents when they attacked a forward operational base located along Walada exit gate, in the town at about 2pm. He said the insurgents met “serious resistance” and superior fire power of the troops who engaged them in a heavy gun battle that lasted for hours, forcing them to withdraw. Musa said the troops, supported by the air component of OPHK mounted a hot pursuit and closed up with the insurgents. He said three other insurgents were also arrested. The commander added that the troops recovered motorcycles and other assorted weapons from the insurgents. While commending them for the great feat, Musa asked the troops to be more decisive and ensure total annihilation of the insurgents.
