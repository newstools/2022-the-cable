The Lagos fire service says firefighters put out an inferno that affected a gas truck in the state on Thursday. In a statement on Thursday, Margaret Adeseye, director of the service, said the 20,000 cubic feet gas truck caught fire while on motion along the MKO Abiola way inward Ijora, Apapa. Adeseye said that there was no casualty as the fire was contained on time. “The incident which was reported to the Lagos State Fire and Rescue Service at 13:12 hours was successfully contained by the combined efforts of the State and Federal Fire Service,” she said. “There is no record of injury or death as the firemen mitigated the emergency situation from leading to a secondary incident that may have resulted in disaster. “Meanwhile, efforts are ongoing to evacuate the remains of the truck.” See photos below. <img class="aligncenter wp-image-675932" src="https://f5p3e9e4.stackpathcdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/WhatsApp-Image-2022-03-17-at-6.27.50-PM.jpeg" alt="" width="550" height="393" srcset="https://f5p3e9e4.stackpathcdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/WhatsApp-Image-2022-03-17-at-6.27.50-PM.jpeg 720w, https://f5p3e9e4.stackpathcdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/WhatsApp-Image-2022-03-17-at-6.27.50-PM-300x215.jpeg 300w, https://f5p3e9e4.stackpathcdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/WhatsApp-Image-2022-03-17-at-6.27.50-PM-24x17.jpeg 24w, https://f5p3e9e4.stackpathcdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/WhatsApp-Image-2022-03-17-at-6.27.50-PM-36x26.jpeg 36w, https://f5p3e9e4.stackpathcdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/WhatsApp-Image-2022-03-17-at-6.27.50-PM-48x34.jpeg 48w" sizes="(max-width: 550px) 100vw, 550px" /> <img class="aligncenter wp-image-675929" src="https://f5p3e9e4.stackpathcdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/WhatsApp-Image-2022-03-17-at-6.27.51-PM.jpeg" alt="" width="550" height="468" srcset="https://f5p3e9e4.stackpathcdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/WhatsApp-Image-2022-03-17-at-6.27.51-PM.jpeg 685w, https://f5p3e9e4.stackpathcdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/WhatsApp-Image-2022-03-17-at-6.27.51-PM-300x255.jpeg 300w, https://f5p3e9e4.stackpathcdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/WhatsApp-Image-2022-03-17-at-6.27.51-PM-24x20.jpeg 24w, https://f5p3e9e4.stackpathcdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/WhatsApp-Image-2022-03-17-at-6.27.51-PM-36x31.jpeg 36w, https://f5p3e9e4.stackpathcdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/WhatsApp-Image-2022-03-17-at-6.27.51-PM-48x41.jpeg 48w" sizes="(max-width: 550px) 100vw, 550px" /> <img class="aligncenter wp-image-675927" src="https://f5p3e9e4.stackpathcdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/WhatsApp-Image-2022-03-17-at-6.27.55-PM.jpeg" alt="" width="550" height="506" srcset="https://f5p3e9e4.stackpathcdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/WhatsApp-Image-2022-03-17-at-6.27.55-PM.jpeg 672w, https://f5p3e9e4.stackpathcdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/WhatsApp-Image-2022-03-17-at-6.27.55-PM-300x276.jpeg 300w, https://f5p3e9e4.stackpathcdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/WhatsApp-Image-2022-03-17-at-6.27.55-PM-24x22.jpeg 24w, https://f5p3e9e4.stackpathcdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/WhatsApp-Image-2022-03-17-at-6.27.55-PM-36x33.jpeg 36w, https://f5p3e9e4.stackpathcdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/WhatsApp-Image-2022-03-17-at-6.27.55-PM-48x44.jpeg 48w" sizes="(max-width: 550px) 100vw, 550px" /> <img class="aligncenter wp-image-675925" src="https://f5p3e9e4.stackpathcdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/WhatsApp-Image-2022-03-17-at-6.27.56-PM.jpeg" alt="" width="550" height="500" srcset="https://f5p3e9e4.stackpathcdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/WhatsApp-Image-2022-03-17-at-6.27.56-PM.jpeg 672w, https://f5p3e9e4.stackpathcdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/WhatsApp-Image-2022-03-17-at-6.27.56-PM-300x273.jpeg 300w, https://f5p3e9e4.stackpathcdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/WhatsApp-Image-2022-03-17-at-6.27.56-PM-24x22.jpeg 24w, https://f5p3e9e4.stackpathcdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/WhatsApp-Image-2022-03-17-at-6.27.56-PM-36x33.jpeg 36w, https://f5p3e9e4.stackpathcdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/WhatsApp-Image-2022-03-17-at-6.27.56-PM-48x44.jpeg 48w" sizes="(max-width: 550px) 100vw, 550px" />
