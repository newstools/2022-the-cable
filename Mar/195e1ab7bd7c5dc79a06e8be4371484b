A video has surfaced showing how Bianca Ojukwu slapped Ebelechukwu, wife of Willie Obiano, former governor of Anambra state. The scuffle occurred on Thursday at the inauguration of Chukwuma Soludo as governor of the state. Soludo was sworn in at the government house in Anambra. Dignitaries, including Obiano, were already seated when the altercation played out. In the viral video seen by TheCable, Ebelechukwu stood up from her seat and moved to where Bianca, widow of Chukwuemeka Ojukwu, was seated and spoke to her. Although Ebelechukwu was inaudible, the video showed how Bianca rose and gave her a slap, leading to a commotion. The incident drew the attention of security agents and some personalities who pulled Obiano’s wife away from Bianca. Ebelechukwu was taken away from the scene of the event and shortly afterwards, her husband left the venue. The two women have reportedly been at loggerheads for years.
