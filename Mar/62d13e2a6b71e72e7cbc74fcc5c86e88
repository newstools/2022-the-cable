Bola Tinubu, a chieftain of the All Progressives Congress (APC), says the recent attack on an Abuja-Kaduna train is an incident that requires serious reflection. He spoke on Tuesday at what should have been a colloquium organised in honour of his 70th birthday. The event was, however, cancelled over the attack. On Monday night, gunmen attacked the train, which was conveying passengers from Abuja and was a short distance from its destination. Although the exact number of casualties is not yet known, Chinelo Megafo, a dental surgeon, has been confirmed as one of those killed in the attack. Speaking on Tuesday before he announced the cancellation of the colloquium, Tinubu said the incident speaks to the state of the country’s security. “I have just been informed of a very sad incident in our country, that over 60 people and many more were killed and bombed on the train between Kaduna and Abuja,” he said. “That is a very serious incident about the security of lives in this country and it calls for a very serious, sober reflection. “To me, to be here celebrating, dancing and enjoying, doesn’t show enough concern of a statesman as a senior citizen of this country.” He declared the event cancelled and urged attendees to pray for the country.
