The management of Innoson Vehicle Manufacturing Company has thanked Charles Soludo, governor of Anambra state, for keeping his promise to use its vehicle as official car. Before his inauguration, Soludo had pledged to prioritise local brands, saying he would only use Innoson vehicles manufactured in Nnewi, Anambra, as his administration’s official vehicle. Soludo took the oath of office as Anambra governor alongside Onyeka Ibezim, his deputy, at a low-key event on Thursday. Amid promises to patronise only “made in Anambra, Nigeria and Africa” products, the governor made a statement by arriving at the ceremony in the vehicle. “When you see me in Innoson vehicles or my Akwete dress with a pair of shoes made in Ogbunike/Nkwelle Ezunaka and Onitsha, we are making a statement,” the governor had said. In a statement on Saturday, Cornel Osigwe, head of corporate communications, Innoson Group, expressed gratitude to the governor for fulfilling his promises at his inauguration ceremony. “The company is delighted to see him keep his words on the occasion of his Inauguration,” it said. “The company is grateful that Mr. Governor wants to look inward, partner with and promote local products. “The Innoson Group looks forward to a fruitful partnership with the government under your leadership and wishes to reiterate her commitment to support your government in any way possible to ensure it achieves her vision.” “Thank you and cheers to a better Anambra.”
