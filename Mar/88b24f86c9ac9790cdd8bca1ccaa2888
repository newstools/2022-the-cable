Bushra Balogun, an activist and member of the All Progressives Congress (APC), says the party should consider women for key positions during the convention. The APC national convention is scheduled for Saturday. Bushra said party delegates should elect women into offices other than “those of women leaders or any position that self-selects based on gender”. “sometimes the right man for the job might not be a man but a woman. Moreso, going out of the box and giving another gender the chance might be more advantageous in terms of legitimacy, loyalty, efficiency, support and results,” she said. The activist pleaded with delegates to rally around Rinsola Abiola, a female candidate vying for the position of youth leader. “The APC should proudly embrace and support this progressive trend, and rally around Rinsola Abiola who is willing to test the waters and prove her capacity, just as her male counterparts have done over time,’’ Bushra said. She said the delegates should make history by supporting a female candidate who has demonstrated competence through political engagements. “The letter appealed to delegates’ conscience to attempt a mind-shift, in making history, by supporting a female candidate who has not only showed interest to hold this office of the APC Youth Leader in the upcoming party convention but has demonstrated competence through her robust CV in grassroots and political engagements,‘’ she said. ‘’ Thereupon, I appeal to you all, to take a chance on her and vote her as part of the party’s pro-women agenda as you go to the polls, on Saturday, 26th March 2022.”
