Gunmen have set ablaze the secretariat of Nnewi south LGA in Ukpor, Anambra state. A security guard in the secretariat was said to have been killed in the incident. Tochukwu Ikenga, the Anambra police spokesman, confirmed the incident to TheCable. Ikenga, however, said he could not confirm if there were any casualties. “Yes, there was a suspected case of arson,” he said. “The incident took place very early this morning. “I cannot confirm if there was any casualty because I don’t have information about that but when we find out more about the incident, we will put the information out.” The police spokesman added that security operatives had been deployed in the area. The incident is the latest of its kind in the south-east in recent weeks. Earlier this month, gunmen set ablaze the Umuguma divisional police headquarters in Owerri west LGA of Imo state. The police station came under heavy attack for hours, with the gunmen shooting sporadically. Buildings, including cars in the vicinity, were also razed during the attack.
