Yusuf Lasun, the former deputy speaker of the house of representatives, has resigned his membership of the All Progressives Congress (APC). Lasun submitted his resignation letter on Friday at the APC secretariat in Osogbo, the Osun capital. The development comes hours before the APC convention scheduled to hold on Saturday. Kola Olabisi, media consultant to the Osun APC chairman, confirmed the development to NAN. “I and other executive members of the party are currently in Abuja for the party’s national convention holding on Saturday. The information of Yusuf’s resignation has been communicated to us,” Olabisi said. Lasun had contested the APC governorship primary on February 19, 2022. The former deputy speaker contested against Gboyega Oyetola, governor of Osun, and Moshood Adeoti, a former secretary to the state government under the administration of Rauf Aregbesola. Oyetola had secured the party’s ticket, but the exercise was not without controversy. The incumbent governor was adjudged to have polled 222,169 votes; his closest challenger, Moshood Adeoti, secured 12,921 votes, while Lasun got 460.
