The federal government says it will not tolerate the recruitment of Nigerians into the Ukrainian army to fight against Russia. On February 24, Russian troops invaded Ukraine after Vladimir Putin ordered a special military operation in Donbas, a separatist-held region in the country. Since the invasion, there have been reported casualties from both parties, leading many Ukrainians, including Nigerians, to flee to neighbouring countries. Last week, over 100 Nigerians had reportedly visited the Ukrainian embassy in Abuja seeking to be recruited to fight in the war. In a statement issued on Monday by Francisca Omayuli, the ministry of foreign affairs said the federal government contacted the Ukrainian embassy to verify the report. The ministry said the embassy confirmed that a number of Nigerians had indicated their willingness to fight for Ukraine in the ongoing conflict with Russia. “Furthermore, the Embassy clarified that the Ukrainian government is not admitting foreign volunteer fighters and as such dissociated itself from the claim that it is requesting $1,000 from each Nigerian volunteer for air ticket and visa,” the statement reads. “As a responsible member of the international community and consistent with our obligations under international law, Nigeria discourages the use of mercenaries anywhere in the world and will not tolerate the recruitment, in Nigeria, of Nigerians as mercenaries to fight in Ukraine or anywhere else in the world. “The Federal Government will continue to engage with the Embassy of Ukraine in Nigeria and other relevant authorities to prevent this possibility.”
