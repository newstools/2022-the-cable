Hope Uzodimma, Imo governor, says gunmen who set ablaze the home of George Obiozor, Ohanaeze Ndigbo president-general, will be brought to book. TheCable had reported that the house of Obiozor was set on fire in the early hours of Saturday by yet to be identified gunmen. The governor described the perpetrators as “political bandits” while he also condemned the action and vowed to hunt them down. “The time of those who unleash this kind of mayhem in the state is over. We shall hunt them down to face the full weight of the law,” he said. Uzodimma criticised the violent approach in settling political differences by some politicians in the state, warning that the government will no longer condone such banditry. He said it was shameful that both the sponsors and perpetrators of the violence deployed their attack on an innocent man. The governor assured Imo people that his government will continue to do all within its constitutional power to protect lives and property in the state.
