Orji Uzor Kalu, chief whip of the senate, says the future of the south-east geopolitical zone is in the All Progressives Congress (APC). Kalu, who is an APC presidential aspirant, made the comment in a post on his verified Facebook page on Saturday. In the post, he also advised APC members in Abia to “forget about jumping ship” amid the crisis rocking the party in the state. The recent crisis in Abia APC has divided the party into two factions, with some members loyal to Ikechi Emenike while Donatus Nwankpa, a former chairman of the party in the state, leads another group. The crisis has resulted in several court cases, worsening the division in the party. Kalu urged the party members “to be patient,” adding that “it may be rough today but definitely not the same tomorrow”. “In today’s politics of Nigeria, the future of the South-East geopolitical zone is in the All Progressives Congress (APC ). This is why I have continued to encourage all members of the APC in Abia State to remain in the party and forget about jumping ship,” Kalu wrote. “The reality is that in every democratic setting, the majority will always have their way. In addition, the signing of the electoral act by President Muhammadu Buhari has also given Nigerians the assurance that it is impossible for one man to win elections. “Those who believe in the party and Mr President is encouraged to remain faithful to the party and support the growth of the party across board. “I am pleading with my brothers and sisters who are passing through difficult moments to be patient . It may be rough today but definitely not the same tomorrow”.
