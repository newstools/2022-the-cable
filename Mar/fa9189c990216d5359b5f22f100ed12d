The Nigerian Railway Corporation (NRC) says the Lagos-Ibadan train stopped midway due to fuel gauge failure. The corporation said this while reacting to a trending video showing how passengers were stranded on Thursday after the train “ran out of diesel”. Fidet Okhiria, NRC managing director, told NAN in Lagos on Thursday night that passengers coming to Lagos from Ibadan through the standard gauge train were not stranded as the matter was “resolved with an hour”. “The train gauge had an issue while the engineers thought the diesel in the train tank would take them to Lagos,” he said. “The train gauge was not reading correctly, so by the time they started moving, the driver discovered that there is no sufficient diesel in the train. “Immediately they discovered the challenge, they responded quickly, and under an hour, they were able to get a drum of diesel to fill the tank and continued the journey back to Lagos.” TheCable had reported how the train stopped abruptly after ‘running out of diesel’. According to a Twitter user, King Isaiah Obadore, who was reportedly on the train, the crew members said the train stopped moving because it had exhausted diesel. “Boarded Train from Ibadan to Lagos. We’re still stuck in the forest with unknown Chinese Men,” Obadore had said. “They said fuel finished. What a beautiful country, Nigeria.”
