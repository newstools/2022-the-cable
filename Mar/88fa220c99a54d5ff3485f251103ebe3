The Miyetti Allah Cattle Breeders Association of Nigeria (MACBAN), says attacks on herders are having a negative impact on the livestock industry. The association’s position was contained in a communique signed by Hussein Bosso and Baba Ngelzarma, national president and secretary of MACBAN, respectively, following a meeting in Abuja. According to NAN, the meeting deliberated on security challenges facing herders across the country. “The meeting also expressed serious concerns about the continuous displacement of thousands of pastoralists’ families as a result of cattle rustling, banditry, kidnapping and the activities of outlawed groups,” the communique reads. “They attack, maim, or kill pastoralists without any just cause. If this continues, it might soon bankrupt the livestock industry as a whole.” The NEC also directed state chapters to conduct town hall meetings, involving community leaders and other critical stakeholders to address issues affecting pastoralists. “State chapters were also directed to address factors affecting the well-being of pastoralists and invoke the culture of ‘Pulaku’ against any family that harbours or aids criminality,” the communique reads. “The association expressed its appreciation for the support it had received, as well as the concern of the Sultan of Sokoto, Alhaji Sa’ad Abubakar III, on the plight of pastoralists. “MACBAN assures the Sultan that the association will do whatever it takes to restore dignity, culture of Fulani people and address issues affecting pastoralists with all the seriousness it deserves.” MACBAN also appealed to the Sultan to organise a national conference involving critical stakeholders “with the view to addressing issues of insecurity, economic empowerment and the negative profiling of pastoralists in the social and mainstream media”.
