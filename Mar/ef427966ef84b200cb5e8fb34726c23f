Babatunde Fashola, minister of works and housing, says the second Niger bridge will be completed in April. Fashola disclosed this on Tuesday during an inspection tour of the bridge. According to the minister, the high-tension transmission lines across the bridge will be relocated leading to power disruptions in the area for two weeks. He added that the high-tension cables are too low for the bridge. “April is the completion date. Earlier, I had said it will end in February or at the latest, end of the first quarter,” Fashola said. “Before now, some people said there was no bridge, but now we are walking on the bridge. This is real now. Plus or minus, when we cross the Ts and dot the Is, we will complete it as promised — 11kms and 12kms on both sides of the bridge. “Power will be shut down for two weeks to enable the generating and transmission companies as well as the ministry of power to work seamlessly on the project. “We plead that those affected will cooperate as nobody will be shut out permanently.” Speaking during the tour, Chris Ngige, minister of labour and employment, said the bridge will be inaugurated in October, adding that all other concerns will be taken into consideration. “What is important is for the bridge to be completed and commissioned in October. The speed, the environmental concerns are taken care of and the quality of the bridge to last for many decades are worth celebrating,” he said. Adeyemo Ajani, the federal controller of works in Anambra state, said the pace of work was impacted negatively by the outbreak of coronavirus.
