President Muhammadu Buhari has approved the appointment of 15 members for the board of the National Directorate of Employment (NDE). Garba Shehu, presidential spokesperson, disclosed this in a statement on Thursday. The previous NDE board was inaugurated in March 2018. In December 2020, the president had relieved Nasiru Argungu of his position as NDE DG. Prior to the removal of Argungu, he and Festus Keyamo, minister of state for labour and employment, had a running battle over the employment of 774,000 youths for a three-month programme meant to cushion the effects of COVID on the masses. In January 2021, Buhari has approved the appointment of Abubakar Nuhu Fikpo as acting director-general of the National Directorate of Employment (NDE) — despite a request by the national assembly asking the president to reverse Arugungu’s sack. The new board, which includes members from different ministries, departments and agencies, will serve for a period of four years. According to the statement, the board will be inaugurated by Keyamo on a date to be communicated later. The board will be chaired by Keyamo, while members include Fikpo, the acting NDE DG; Chris Maiyaki representing the National Universities Commission, Lawal Hafiz representing the National Board for Technical Education (NBTE), Tony Omoaghe, Obiageli  Orah, Yamah Patience representing the ministry of agriculture and rural development, Didi Walson-Jack representing the ministry of water resources, and Mohammed Ndadoko representing the ministry of industry, trade and investment. Others are Yerima Terfa from the ministry of labour and employment, Rasaq Bello-Osagie, Olubunmi Osuntuyi representing the Nigeria Employers’ Consultative Association, Amechi Asugwuni representing the Nigeria Labour Congress, Collins Umukoro, and Andrew Egunoma.
