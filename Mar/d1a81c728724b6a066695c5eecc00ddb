TeamApt, a Nigerian fintech company, says it has opened applications for the 2022 Women in Tech internship programme tagged ‘The Apt 5’. The company announced this in a statement on Tuesday. The Apt 5 is a paid internship programme. TeamApt said this year’s edition was in collaboration with Ingressive for Good, a non-profit organisation, to ensure that as many women as possible have access to the opportunity. Commenting on the programme, Edidiong Uwemakpan, director of brand and corporate communications at TeamApt, said: “We are committed to building the tech talent pipeline across Africa and have partnered with a number of universities to facilitate this, but it’s not lost on us that the tech industry is still vastly male-dominated. “This programme ensures that more women have access to the kind of opportunities that can fast-track their careers in technology. “Some interns from the last cohort are already full-time engineers with the organisation now, and that’s the exact pace of growth this enables.” In her remarks, Blessing Abeng, co-founder of Ingressive for Good, urged more tech companies to help women kickstart their tech careers by giving them a chance to build the experience based on their learning. “Beyond panels, and words, bold and direct action like this one, makes a lot of difference. We have had women’s lives change forever just because they landed one internship,” Abeng added. “A woman in our community now earns 10x what she used to earn last year because of a tech internship that skyrocketed her tech career, landing her a full-time role.” Women are encouraged to visit the TeamApt career page to apply from today till Tuesday, March 22, 2021. TeamApt said that based on the women’s performance, they may be offered full employment within the organisation.
