Senegal has condemned a call by Ukraine’s embassy for Senegalese volunteers to join its fight against Russia. The West African country said it learned of a Facebook post by the embassy of Ukraine in Dakar, appealing to foreign citizens for help. Senegal’s foreign ministry said Yurii Pyvovarov, ambassador of Ukraine to Senegal, was subsequently invited to verify the publication — and he confirmed that 36 volunteers were already registered. “In view of the seriousness of such facts, the Ministry officially notified, on behalf of the Government of the Republic of Senegal, a note verbale of protest strongly condemning this practice which constitutes a flagrant violation of the Vienna Convention on Diplomatic Relations, in particular with regard to the obligation to respect the laws and regulations of the receiving State,” the foreign ministry said in a statement issued on Thursday. “Consequently, the Ministry urged the Embassy to immediately withdraw the above-mentioned appeal and cease, without delay, any procedure for enlisting persons of Senegalese or foreign nationality, from Senegalese territory. “Failing this, the Department reserves the right to make any decision that the situation calls for. The Ministry would like to point out that the recruitment of volunteers, mercenaries or foreign fighters on Senegalese territory is illegal and punishable by the penalties provided for by law.” In response, the Ukrainian embassy announced that it had stopped registration for volunteers in Senegal. Meanwhile, some Nigerians have shown interest in travelling to Ukraine to fight Russian forces. Ukraine’s embassy in Nigeria had however said the volunteers must provide $1,000 for tickets and visas.
