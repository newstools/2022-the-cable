The justice movement, a group, has asked Abubakar Malami, attorney-general of the federation, and Usman Baba, inspector-general of police (IGP), to revisit the investigation into the killing of Bola Ige, a former justice minister. Ige, an attorney-general of the federation under the Olusegun Obasanjo administration, was murdered at his residence in Ibadan, Oyo state, in December 2001. In 2016, President Muhammadu Buhari had ordered that the investigation into the murder be reopened but not much has been heard about it since. In a statement on Monday, Olalekan Olusola, secretary of the justice movement, said the group will get an order to compel Malami and the IGP if they refuse to revisit the case within seven days. “It would be recalled that President Muhammadu Buhari had in 2016 directed that the case be revisited. It is frustrating that six years after Mr President’s directive, nothing has been heard about the case,” Olusola said. “We want the attorney-general of the federation and the inspector-general of police to beam their searchlight on the matter. “It is a travesty that those suspected of culpability in the murder have been walking freely while dancing on the grave of the respected sage. “We are by this statement issuing a seven-day ultimatum to both AGF and IGP to do the needful or be dragged to court.”
