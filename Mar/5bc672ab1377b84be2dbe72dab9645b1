President Muhammadu Buhari has summoned Abubakar Aliyu, minister of power, for a meeting at the presidential villa. The president is expected to discuss the erratic power supply experienced across the country in recent weeks. Buhari also called for a meeting with Hope Uzodimma, governor of Imo, over the fresh wave of violence in the state. Doyin Salami, the president’s chief economic adviser, was also summoned for a meeting on the state of the country’s economy. Garba Shehu, senior special assistant to the president on media and publicity, announced the development in a statement on Monday. “The President is scheduled to meet separately with them and he would be apprised of the latest developments in Imo State, the power sector and the state of the economy,” the statement reads. “It would be recalled that the President while condemning the spate of violence in Imo State in the aftermath of the destruction of buildings and assets of the Police and the home of Prof. George Obiozor, President-General of Ohaneze Ndigbo, pledged to review the security situation in southeast Nigeria. “President Buhari has also voiced his concern over the frequent power outages, apologising to Nigerians and assuring a quick relief to the situation.” The president had last week apologised to Nigerians over the petrol scarcity and power outage experienced in the country. Buhari had said the collapse of the national grid was being addressed, adding that “relief is on the way”. “A dip in hydroelectric generation due to seasonal pressures has coincided with technical and supply problems at thermal stations,” the president had said.
