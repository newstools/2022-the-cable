The All Progressives Congress (APC) has cancelled its emergency national executive committee (NEC) meeting slated for Thursday, March 17. According to a statement issued by John Akpanudoedehe, secretary of the caretaker/extraordinary convention planning committee (CECPC), the directive was given by Mai Mala Buni, governor of Yobe. “As directed by the National Chairman of the All Progressives Congress (APC) Caretaker/Extraordinary Convention Planning (CECPC) and Governor of Yobe State, H.E. Mai Mala Buni, a purported emergency meeting of the  Party’s National Executive Committee (NEC) slated for Thursday, March 17, 2022 is hereby cancelled,” the statement reads. Abubakar Sani Bello, governor of Niger state, had called for the meeting after he became acting national chairman of the APC. But the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) had rejected the party’s notice for the meeting. TheCable had reported the controversy over the leadership of the APC CECPC. Buni was removed as chairman of the party, and replaced with Bello after APC governors revealed his plan to scuttle the party’s convention and remain chairman. TheCable had also reported how Bello denied knowledge of a letter from Buni informing him of a leave of absence. The Yobe governor was said to have travelled abroad for medical treatment. In a twist on Tuesday, the APC said Buni was still in charge of the party and that all activities are done “in proxy” under his directive. Earlier on Wednesday, President Muhammadu Buhari asked the APC to allow Buni to plan the party’s national convention. Buhari explained that the party needs to avoid litigation ahead of the 2023 elections.
