The Ogun state police command says its operatives have arrested one Idowu Shittu, a 35-year-old man, over the alleged rape of his wife’s 11-year-old cousin. According to the police, Shittu has been raping the victim for the past three years. Abimbola Oyeyemi, Ogun police spokesperson, in a statement on Sunday, said the victim lives with the suspect’s family at the Ifo axis of the state, owing to the death of her mother when she was a toddler. Oyeyemi disclosed that the suspect was arrested following a complaint lodged by his wife. “The suspect, a resident of Hallelujah street, Ifo, was arrested following a report lodged at Ifo divisional headquarters by his wife, who reported that her cousin, who lives with them informed her that her husband — Idowu Shittu  — has been forcefully having sex with her for the past three years,” the statement reads. “And when she (referring to the victim) can no longer bear it, she decided to inform her aunt. “The little girl, who has lost her mother since when she was a toddler said she has been enduring it because she has no other place to live if her aunt’s husband decided to send her away as he usually threatens whenever he wants to have his way with her. “Upon the report, the Dpo Ifo division, CSP Kehinde Kuranga, quickly detailed his detectives to the scene where the suspect was arrested. “On interrogation, the suspect confessed to the crime but pleaded for forgiveness from the little girl.”
