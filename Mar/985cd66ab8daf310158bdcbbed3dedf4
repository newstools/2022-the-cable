The Kaduna state government has declared a 24-hour curfew in Jema’a and Kaura LGAs. Samuel Aruwan, the commissioner for internal security and home affairs, said the development is based on advice from security agencies. Speaking on Monday, the commissioner said the curfew is with immediate effect. “This is to assist the security agencies to stabilize the situation in the areas, save lives and property and enable the restoration of law and order,” he said in a statement. Aruwan said the security agencies have been fully authorised to enforce the curfew. “Government appeals to all residents of Jema’a and Kaura local government areas to cooperate with the security agencies in the urgent task of restoring peace and upholding law and order,” he added. “Government condemns the violence and all acts of lawlessness that have occurred in the area. Further updates will be issued as necessary.” The development comes in the wake of attacks in Mararaban Agban, Agban and Adan communities in Kaura. About 23 people were reportedly killed by gunmen in the attacks. Several people were also said to have been injured and about 70 houses were reportedly razed by the invaders. A witness told TheCable that the attacks took place around 7 pm on Sunday, March 20.
