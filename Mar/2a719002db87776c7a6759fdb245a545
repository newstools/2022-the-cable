Amina Mohammed, UN deputy secretary-general; Kayode Fayemi, governor of Ekiti, and Atedo Peterside, founder of Stanbic IBTC Bank Plc, have been unveiled as keynote speakers for a symposium to be held in honour of Hamzat Lawal, chief executive at Connected Development (CODE). According to a statement by Seun Durojaiye, communications associate at CODE, the symposium is part of activities marking Lawal’s 35th birthday. The event will hold in Abuja on March 12. Fayemi, who is also chairman of the Nigeria Governors’ Forum (NGF), will discuss the essentials of achieving global excellence in leadership, while Peterside, president/founder of Anap Foundation, will focus on the importance of deliberate leadership in the 21st century. On her part, Mohammed will give the opening statement, while Kadaria Ahmed, seasoned broadcaster, will direct a “fireside chat”. The birthday symposium will also bring together over 500 Nigerians for a “multi-generational dialogue” involving academics, political analysts, activists, good governance advocates, civil society practitioners and government representatives. The event hopes to provide an opportunity for an intergenerational conversation geared towards active citizen participation in governance processes as Nigerians prepare for the 2023 general election. Speaking on expectations at the symposium, Lawal said the event is aimed at carving the path for a better Nigeria. “It’s a great opportunity to be hosting some of the best male and female leaders in Nigeria currently to hold a vital dialogue as we all contribute towards building our country and imbibing the culture of good governance,” he said. “I believe that nation building is the collective responsibility of everyone and I am committed to mobilising young people to play active roles in setting Nigeria towards prosperity.” Earlier on Wednesday, Lawal announced an all-female panel at the symposium.
