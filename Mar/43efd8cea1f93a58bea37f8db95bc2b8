The Northern Senators Forum (NSF) has condemned the attack on a train heading for Kaduna state from the federal capital territory (FCT). The attack occurred around Kateri-Rijana area of Kaduna on Monday night. The train was said to have nearly reached Rigasa, its final stop when the gunmen struck. Some passengers were killed while others sustained injuries. In a statement on Tuesday, Aliyu Magatakarda Wamakko, senator representing Sokoto north and NSF chairman, said it is sad that defenceless citizens died at the hands of “callous and merciless terrorists”. Wamakko said measures must be taken to put a stop to the killing of citizens across the country. “It is devastating hearing about the outrageous attack which was brought to the fore, yet again, the nature of the problem we are dealing with,” the senator said. “It is sad that the precious lives of defenceless citizens get perished in the hands of callous and merciless terrorists. “This is yet another wakeup call not only for our security forces, but indeed all Nigerians to wake up and be more decisive in ending this menace. “We condole with His Excellency President Muhammadu Buhari, the Kaduna State Government as well as families and associates of those who lost their lives in the attack. “But as a tribute to those lost in the attack we must ensure that their lives do not go in vain by bringing the perpetrators to book.”
