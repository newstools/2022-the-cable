Segun Showunmi, former spokesman of the Atiku Campaign Organisation, has vowed to unseat Dapo Abiodun, governor of Ogun, in the 2023 election in the state. Speaking on Monday at the national secretariat of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) in Abuja, Showunmi said he decided to pick the nomination form for the 2023 governorship election in the state to yield the call of his people. The former Atiku campaign spokesman said he would redefine governance in the state if elected as governor. Showunmi noted that he is confident of victory in the forthcoming election, saying there are no fears either within the party or across party lines. “I am humbled, to say the least. People paid their way in these hard times from everywhere to stand with me today. You have continued to call on me to contest the governorship of our dear Ogun state, and today I have demonstrated that I have heard you clearly. The job has started, let’s go there,” Showunmi said. “I don’t have gold to give for this overwhelming support, neither do I have silver. But I assure you, I will make the people of Ogun state and my humble self proud as I take sure footed steps, abiding by selfless principles on this journey to the next level of leadership.” On Wednesday, some PDP stakeholders across the 20 LGAs in the state had converged in Abeokuta, the state capital, to endorse Showunmi as the party’s choice for the 2023 gubernatorial election. The stakeholders added that it was time to wrestle power from the ruling All Progressives Congress (APC) in the state, saying Showunmi is the best bet if PDP will take back power again.
