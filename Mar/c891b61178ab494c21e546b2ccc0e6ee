President Muhammadu Buhari says Vice-President Yemi Osinbajo is in charge whenever he is out of the country. The president departed Abuja on Sunday for his routine medical checkup in the UK. Speaking to state house correspondents before his departure at the Nnamdi Azikiwe International Airport, the president said he has capable hands to run the government in his absence. “Well, I cannot claim to be doing the work alone. The government is fully represented; the vice-president is there. Constitutionally, when I’m away, he’s in charge. And the secretary to the government and then the chief of staff. So, I have no problem,” Buhari said. However, the president did not say if he sent a letter to the national assembly as required by the constitution. Whenever the President is proceeding on vacation or is otherwise unable to discharge the functions of his Office, he shall transmit a written declaration to the President of the Senate and the Speaker of the House of Representatives to that effect, and until he transmits to them a written declaration to the contrary, the Vice-President shall perform the functions of the President as Acting President. The last time the president sent a letter to that effect to the national assembly was in August 2018. On the forthcoming national convention of the ruling All Progressives Congress (APC), Buhari expressed confidence that the exercise will be successful. “Well, they should wait and see. How did we come as a party to take power from the ruling party who had been there before us for so many years? So we have the capacity, everything will be alright,” the president added.
