Ebun-Olu Adegboruwa, a senior advocate of Nigeria (SAN), says no effort should be spared to unravel the details of the “murder” of Oluwabamise Ayanwola. Adegboruwa said this in a statement issued on Monday. Bamise, a fashion designer, was found dead on Monday — nine days after she was declared missing after she boarded a bus rapid transit (BRT) vehicle. Speaking on the incident, Adegboruwa said the state should spare no effort to get justice for the victim. “No one should be left untouched in this matter. No effort should be spared in unravelling the truth and no amount of money can be too much for the government to spend in getting to the very root of it all. Nothing should be left to guess work at all,” he said. “The gory details of the cold-blooded murder of Miss Oluwabamise Ayanwole is too chilling to swallow. “The undisputed fact so far is that she was picked by a Bus Rapid Transit of the Lagos State Government around Chevron area of Lagos State, alive, and has now been found dead. “The details of this gruesome act show clearly that life has become more endangered in the State, even though measures may have been put in place to stem this tide. “Cases of missing persons and kidnapping have been on the increase lately and this should call for concern by all and sundry. “It is worrisome that a government facility, meant to ease the burden of people, has turned out to be a death trap.” He also expressed his condolences to the family of the deceased. “I do sympathise with the family and the good people of Lagos and Ekiti States, while praying to God to comfort all concerned at this very critical time,” he said.
