The federal government says from April 4, fully-vaccinated travellers entering Nigeria will no longer be required to take pre-departure PCR COVID tests. Boss Mustapha, chairman of the presidential steering committee (PSC) on COVID-19, said this on Monday at a media briefing in Abuja. The PSC chairman said although there has been a consistent decline in number of cases around the world, it should not be a reason completely relax protocol considering recent report of infections in countries like China and South Korea. He said the the PSC has reviewed the situations around the world and revised the international travel protocol which is expected to come into effect on April 4. “In-bound (fully vaccinated) passengers arriving in Nigeria will no longer be required to take a pre-departure PCR COVID-19 test,” he said. “On arrival, for fully vaccinated passengers, a sample will be taken at the airport for rapid antigen test by the NCDC within the arrival hall of the airport. “Passengers who are unvaccinated or partially vaccinated shall take a COVID-19 PCR test 48 hours before departure, or do a day 2 and day 7 test on arrival. Such passengers will be expected to pay for their PCR tests through the travel platform. “Fully vaccinated passengers will not be charged for arrival rapid antigen tests at the airport.” Mustapha added that the rules also apply to children aged between 10 and 18. “Rules that apply to fully vaccinated adults also apply to children aged 10 to 18 years; they will not be required to have pre-arrival PCR tests but will have a sample taken at the arrival hall but not charged,” he said. “All passengers travelling out of Nigeria are encouraged to be fully vaccinated and to fully comply with COVID-19 protocol and requirements in their country of destination. “The PSC continues to strongly recommend the use of face masks in enclosed environments. In open spaces, the use of face masks is discretional.”
