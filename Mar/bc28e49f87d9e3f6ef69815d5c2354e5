Bode George, a chieftain of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP), says he will relocate to Ghana if Bola Tinubu, a former governor of Lagos, becomes Nigeria’s president in 2023. On January 10, Tinubu, a chieftain of the All Progressives Congress (APC), announced his intention to contest the presidency in the 2023 general election. Since then, the former Lagos governor and his supporters have travelled to many parts of the country to consult with traditional rulers and political stakeholders. In a press briefing in Lagos on Saturday, George said Tinubu would ensure that his family members occupy sensitive positions if he becomes president, adding that the ex-governor has done nothing to deserve the seat. “I am happy the president has signed the new electoral bill. If by whatever chance he (referring to Tinubu) gets to the villa, I won’t be part of this country,” he said. “And I am not joking. I can go to Ghana, live in Ghana and be watching with binoculars from afar. You will see what will happen. “This is Alpha Beta in Lagos. He will create some Alter Beta somewhere to carry your money. His wife will now be senate president. His son will be governor of Lagos. His daughter will be Iyaloja of Nigeria. “What has he done to prove that he deserves to be honoured by anybody in this country?” “Nothing personal. In fact, my niece called me. She said ‘some of their people are spinning that he gives me money. That Bola gives me money’. “Let him bring the money. I will tell him to follow me to Lagos Island — people who are hungry are there. I grew up there — in Lagos Island.”
