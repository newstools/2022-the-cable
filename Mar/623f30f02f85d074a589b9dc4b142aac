The federal executive council (FEC) has approved N92.123 billion for the construction of a second runway at the Nnamdi Azikiwe International Airport, Abuja. The meeting, presided over by President Muhammadu Buhari, was held on Wednesday. Hadi Sirika, minister of aviation, announced the development to state house correspondents after the FEC meeting at the presidential villa, Abuja. He said the entire sum would be spread over a number of projects to be carried out at the airport. The approval is coming a day after the inauguration of a new terminal building at the Murtala Muhammed International Airport (MMIA), Lagos. While inaugurating the building on Tuesday, the president had instructed Zainab Ahmed, minister of finance, budget and national planning, to source funding for the second runway project of the Abuja airport. However, when asked by state house correspondents how the government intends to raise funding for the project, Sirika said the administration would use the same approach employed for raising funding for other projects across various sectors. The runway project is expected to be delivered in 12 months.
