An Indian high court has supported the ban on the wearing of hijab by Muslim students across Indian schools. According to NDTV, the court, on Tuesday, said wearing hijabs is not an “essential religious practice”, adding that the government has the right to place restrictions on its usage in schools. The Karnataka state government had on February 5 banned clothes “which disturb equality, integrity and public order” in schools and colleges in India. TheCable had reported how some students wearing hijab to school in the Udupi district of Karnataka were prevented from entering their classes. The directive had resulted in a protest by a group of Muslim students who challenged the ban. “We are of the considered opinion that wearing of hijab by Muslim women does not form a part of essential religious practice in Islamic faith,” three judges said, refusing to strike down the state government’s ban and dismissing petitions by students,” the court ruled. “The prescription of school uniform is a reasonable restriction which students cannot object to. The government has the power to issue an order.” Following the court’s ruling, the students were said to have maintained that the wearing of hijab is a fundamental human right.
