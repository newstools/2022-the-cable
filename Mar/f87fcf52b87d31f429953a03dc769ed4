Gunmen, on Tuesday, killed seven security operatives, including a divisional police officer (DPO), in Niger state. Bala Kuryas, Niger commissioner of police, confirmed the incident to NAN. According to Kuryas, the gunmen invaded Nasco, headquarters of Magama LGA, on motorcycles and killed seven people, including three police officers and four vigilante operatives. The police commissioner said the gunmen first attacked the police station, before invading communities in the LGA. He added that security personnel have been deployed to the LGA to track the criminals. “We appeal to residents in the state to assist the security personnel deployed to the area with reliable information that could help in apprehending the criminals,” he said. “We are all out to deal with any person or group of people undermining the peaceful atmosphere of our state.” Gunmen have attacked communities across Niger in recent weeks, killing residents and security operatives. In February, at least 10 persons, including security operatives, were killed following an attack that involved the use of an explosive in Galadima Kogo community in the state. Prior to the attack in Galadima Kogo, the gunmen were said to have earlier attacked Gpekure, Makuba and Galapai communities, killing eight people and abducting 13 others. Meanwhile, in January,  three policemen and two local vigilantes were killed in an ambush in Kwanan Dutse, Mariga LGA of Niger.
