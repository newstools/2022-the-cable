Kim Young-Chae, South Korean ambassador to Nigeria, says Nigeria’s 2023 elections are important to the world because of the country’s influence globally. Young-Chae said this on Thursday in Abuja while speaking with journalists on trade relations between both countries, as well as possible areas to advance cooperation. He also urged the governments at all levels and political parties to learn from the just-concluded South Korean presidential election, in which the opposition candidate won the poll. “Nigeria’s election is not only important to Africa but the entire world, considering how influential and strategic the country is,” he said. “You have your general elections next year. It is imperative to the Nigerian government, the Nigerian people and to the world. Nigeria has the biggest democracy and economy in Africa, so Nigeria means a lot not only to this region, but also globally. “We want to see that the election process should be peaceful, without violence; it should be free and fair, and it should be transparent. You have a heavy responsibility to ensure a peaceful election. That is very important and I hope that it will happen. “There has been a peaceful and stable democracy since 1999. The democratic practice has been deep in the country. I will urge everyone to also accept results when it is announced. “South Korea elected a new president, and the candidate of the opposition was declared the winner. Like Nigeria, we have two major parties. This time, the opposition won with less than one percent and I am very proud of Korean citizens because the election was done peacefully.”
