The Kofi Annan Foundation has appointed Samson Itodo as a member of its board. Itodo is the executive director of YIAGA Africa, an organisation focused on building sustainable democracies in Africa, anchored on the principles of inclusion, justice, accountability and constitutionalism. He was also at the forefront of the #NotTooYoungToRun campaign in Nigeria that later became popular across Africa. The Kofi Annan foundation, in a statement on Friday, said Elhadj As Sy, the board’s chairman, expressed optimism about the appointment with the belief that Itodo would bring value to the foundation’s work. “At a time when half of the world’s population is younger than 30, and as urgent challenges require improved and more inclusive governance at all levels, his expertise and commitment to the inclusion of young people in politics and effective leadership will bring great value to our work,” he said. On his part, Itodo said: “It is with great pleasure that I join the board of the Kofi Annan Foundation to contribute to sustaining his legacies and actualising his vision of a democratic, peaceful and prosperous world.” “I am elated to be joining the team of brilliant and visionary world leaders committed to advancing the foundation’s work in building institutions that promote the common good and empowering citizens to drive social change,” he added. Itodo is also a member of the board of International Institute for Democracy and Electoral Assistance (IDEA) — he was appointed as board member in 2020.
