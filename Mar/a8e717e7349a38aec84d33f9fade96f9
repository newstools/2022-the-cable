Emmanuel Umar, commissioner for local government and internal security in Niger state, says 200 bandits were killed during a clash with security operatives over the weekend. Umar said this on Wednesday while briefing journalists in Minna, the Niger capital, on the security situation in the state. The development comes two days after the Niger government said eight gunmen were killed by security operatives during an attack on three communities of Wushishi, Mashegu, and some parts of Kutigi in Lavun LGA. According to Umar, the commanders of some bandit groups were among those killed by the security operatives. He added that some security operatives died during the duel, while others sustained injuries. “Yesterday precisely, our joint security task force had a successful encounter with a group of terrorists terrorising us for the past few weeks,” he said “These groups belong to about four terrorist groups. The groups of Ali Kawaje, Kachalla Halilu, Yellow Jonbros and Bello Turji, most of their commanders were neutralised in the encounter. “God gave our forces victory as over 200 of them were neutralised. “In the encounter, some of our men were injured while some were killed. Our heartfelt condolences go to the families. We appreciate their sacrifices. “Those who were injured are receiving treatment.”
