Ese Brune claimed the silver medal in women’s long jump at the 2022 World Athletics Indoor Championships in Belgrade on Sunday. She leapt 6.85 meters to become the third Nigerian athlete to win medals in all three global athletics championships including the Olympics. Ivana Valueta, a homegirl, claimed the gold medal with a 7:08m jump, while Lorraine Ugen of Great Britain clinched bronze. Brume had won a bronze medal at the 2019 World Athletics Championships in Doha, Qatar. She also claimed bronze at the Tokyo Olympics in 2021. The Delta-born long jumper has now joined Glory Alozie and the late Sunday Bada as athletes who have won medals at world athletics indoor events and the Olympics. The silver medal makes Brume the third Nigerian long jumper after Paul Emordi (silver in 1987) and Chioma Ajunwa (silver in 1997) to make the podium in the history of the indoor competition.
