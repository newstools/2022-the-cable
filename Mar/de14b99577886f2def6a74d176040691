The United States mission in Nigeria, on Thursday, hosted women in journalism to a panel discussion on promoting gender equality. The event, which held at the American Corner in Lagos as well as virtually, featured female journalists from across various beats including sports, business, and politics. The discussion was held in honour of women’s history month, which is celebrated by the US in March of every year. Panellists at the event included Amarachi Ubani of Channels Television, Chisom Mbonu-Ezeoke of SuperSport TV, Stephanie Busari of CNN, Seyitan Atigarin of ARISE News, and Amaka Okoye of Deutsche Welle. Discussions featured issues affecting female journalists in terms of creating opportunities, and ensuring equal representation in the profession. There were also discussions on the peculiarities of working as a female journalist in Nigeria, including how to work through restrictions especially when reporting in dangerous situations, as well as handling social media backlash. Speaking on her experience working in risky areas, Amaka shared her encounter when covering the kidnap of several schoolgirls in Jangebe, Zamfara state. According to her, women need to understand that feeling pain and showing empathy for victims isn’t a sign of weakness. On her part, Seyitan spoke on covering the #EndSARS protests as well as the sittings of the Lagos judicial panel, adding that there is no limit to what women can achieve, irrespective of the field they cover as journalists. Chisom shared her experience as a woman covering sports, saying she had to work for years to carve a niche as a sports reporter by being intentional about going on the field, even when the circumstances appeared unfavourable. On her part, Stephanie spoke on the importance of women understanding self-worth, as well as the importance of taking care of their mental health. The event featured a question-and-answer session, as well as recommendations on how women can achieve excellence in journalism, irrespective of whatever challenges the Nigerian environment may seem to present. In his closing remarks, Stephen Ibelli, public affairs officer, US consulate, said the event was organised as part of efforts to promote gender inclusion for women in journalism.
