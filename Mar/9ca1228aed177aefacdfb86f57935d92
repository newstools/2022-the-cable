Ahmed Makarfi, former governor of Kaduna, says the incessant killings and destruction of property in the state are “horrible, obnoxious and unacceptable”. In a statement on Thursday, Makarfi said the barbaric acts must be condemned by all peace-loving people. “News of a resurgent wave of attacks and violence leading to loss of lives of innocent people around the Jema’a-Kaura-Zangon Kataf Local Governments axis of Kaduna State is as horrible, obnoxious as it is unacceptable,” he said. “These callous acts must be condemned by all people of decency as we must all come together, irrespective of whatever differences, to do whatever it takes to put a stop to this wanton descent into animalism. “I am appalled at the descent to the gutter, by some elements, to whom human life has become so worthless that they waste it at the slightest (in fact, sometimes no) provocation. “I condemn these callous and cowardly acts and appeal to the people of the communities and indeed all people of the state to remain calm, peaceful and law-abiding, as well as resist the temptation of taking the law into their hands.” TheCable had reported on Tuesday how 34 people, including two soldiers, were killed in attacks on Mararaban Agban, Agban and Adan in Kaura LGA of the state on Sunday.
