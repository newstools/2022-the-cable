Women groups protesting against the rejection of the gender bills by the national assembly have suspended their protest. Earlier in March, TheCable had reported how federal lawmakers voted against bills seeking to provide more opportunities for women in governance. On March 8, the house of representatives rescinded its decision on three of the bills, but Eyinnaya Abaribe, senate spokesman, had said the upper legislative may not reconsider the bills. Abiola Akiyode-Afolabi, co-founder of Womanifesto, told journalists on Tuesday that the suspension of the protest came after the leadership of the national assembly promised to reconvene on the rejected bills. “The women this morning were able to gain entrance into the national assembly and we were actually moving into the senate building when the police stopped the movement. And we made them know that today, there is no option, that we needed to speak with the leadership of the national assembly. We have been here for 10 days,” she said. “So, the leadership of national assembly sent messages to us that they would come and meet with us at their own ground. They came to make promises that they would be able to resolve this issue within seven legislative days and that for all the gender bills put together by women, they will address it. “They also committed to ensuring that they will speak to all the other members and reach out to the senate in this regard. “They reconfirmed the fact that they have recommitted the four bills and that they would ensure that is passed. So, we are stopping the occupation for that reason. We would reconvene after the seven legislative days that they have given to us to start again.” Addressing the women, Ado Doguwa, majority leader of the house of representatives, said the national assembly would reconsider its decision on the bills. “Our great Nigerian women, we are here to identify with you. We have heard you loud and clear,” he said. “On behalf of the leadership of the house, we are here to give you our commitment that based on the earlier communication submitted, the entire membership of the house and the senate will continue to identify with what Nigerian women want. “Democracy is about people and numbers. No democracy can play with the number of women in Nigeria.” See photos of the protest below. <img class="aligncenter wp-image-677791"
