Nasir el-Rufai, Kaduna governor, says empowering women increases the quality of lives and improves society. He said this while flagging off the disbursement of N200 million as part of Kaduna State Women Empowerment Fund (KADSWEF). The flag-off ceremony was part of activities to mark the 2022 International Women’s Day. The governor said the fund is meant to support small-scale traders with capital to grow their businesses. “When you give a loan to a woman, she pays for her children’s education, feeds her children, and helps her husband. Our women in Kaduna have done very well to make us succeed,” he said. “Women are the basis of humanity; women are the root of humanity and when the quality of the lives of women is improved, the quality of society improves.” El-Rufai said the state’s ministry of women affairs requested N100 million, but “we doubled it to N200 million and we have been consistently doing it since 2019”. “It’s only in 2020 that we did not do it due to the COVID-19 lockdown,” he added. He commended members of the state executive council for consistently supporting programmes that empower the underprivileged, especially “those that really need the help of government to stand and climb the ladder”.
