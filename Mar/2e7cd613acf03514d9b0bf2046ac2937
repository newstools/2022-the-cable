The Lagos State Internal Revenue Service (LIRS) says there is no plan to extend the deadline for filing individual annual tax returns beyond its statutory date of March 31, 2022. Speaking at LIRS headquarters in Ikeja, Ayodele Subair, the executive chairman of LIRS, warned that the agency is set to use the full weight of the law in ensuring taxpayers who fail to meet this obligation are “brought to book”. He urged taxpayers to file their annual tax returns before the expiration of the deadline to avoid payment of penalties, as well as other statutory sanctions, which may include prosecution. “Filing of tax returns in Lagos State can only be done on the LIRS eTax portal using: https://etax.lirs.net,” a statement signed by Monsurat Amasa, head of corporate communications, LIRS, quoted Subair as saying. “It is therefore mandatory for all taxable persons in the State to register on the eTax portal, which is built purposely for the convenience of taxpayers. eTax is easy, convenient, and safe.” Subair said that LIRS has in the last three months engaged taxpayers, using various mediums to remind them of their statutory obligations as provided in the Personal Income Tax Act (PITA) Cap P8 2011 (as amended). Taxpayers, he said, include self-employed persons and employees under the PAYE scheme in Lagos. The statement added that tax officers have been designated at various tax stations to assist individuals to carry out online registration and filing of tax returns on the e-Tax portal.
