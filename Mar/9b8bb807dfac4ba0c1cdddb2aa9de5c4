The National Biotechnology Development Agency (NABDA) says its researchers have identified three candidate drugs to be repurposed for the treatment of Lassa fever. Abdullahi Mustapha, director-general of NABDA, disclosed this on Friday in an interview with NAN. Mustapha said scientists at the genetics, genomics, and bioinformatics department of the agency, led by Oyekanmi Nash, its director, worked with other researchers on the discovery. “This is NABDA’s contribution towards finding a lasting solution to Lassa fever disease in Nigeria,” he said. “Diseases are increasing on a yearly basis. So, NABDA has repositioned and repurposed three candidate drugs for the treatment of Lassa fever.” He expressed optimism that the drugs would address the challenges faced in treating patients diagnosed with Lassa fever. Speaking on the meeting held by scientists, researchers, medical practitioners, and technology experts on March 2 in Abuja, Mustapha said the roundtable focused on methods of putting the drugs on clinical trial towards meeting plans to completely eradicate Lassa fever in Nigeria. He said the challenge was to intensify surveillance and response by ensuring the availability of diagnostic centres across most-affected regions. The director-general added that although funding was a major setback to research, the 0.5 percent of gross domestic product (GDP) allocated to research and innovation by the current administration would make an impact. “I hope it will be implemented before another administration comes to power, for it will not only propel research, but will encourage scientists in the diaspora to come home and help develop our nation,” he said. Meanwhile, according to the Nigeria Centre for Disease Control (NCDC), the country has recorded 540 cases of Lassa fever and 98 deaths in 2022.
