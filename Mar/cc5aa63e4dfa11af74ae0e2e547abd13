Nyesom Wike, Rivers state governor, says bills seeking to promote better female representation in governance would have succeeded if President Muhammadu Buhari was in support. The national assembly had, on Tuesday, voted against bills geared at providing more opportunities for women in political parties and governance. In a statement issued by Kelvin Ebiri, his media aide, the governor described the development as a major setback for Nigeria’s democratic advancement. The governor said it is baffling that the lawmakers voted to frustrate the bills. “I watched it and I laughed when I saw our wives, and women were disgraced. It has never happened anywhere. I saw wives of the president and vice president go to plenary session of the national assembly to lobby them, to please help them,” he said. “They (national assembly) promised them. The party (APC) promised them. The same party that promised them failed them. “APC controls the national. assembly. If Mr. President was in support of this, there is no way they will disgrace women in the national assembly.” Wike said the situation in Rivers is different because women are an integral part of the political administration of the state. The governor said there are 23 female vice-chairmen of local governments in Rivers, and at least five female councillors in each LGA — a situation he attributed to the “deliberate policy” implemented by the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) leadership in the state. “There is nothing difficult in Nigeria. It is just because they want to punish the people. When people talk about Nigeria is lacking this, Nigeria is lacking that, I say it is because of the leadership,” he said. Wike added that the APC is not committed to the development of Nigeria.
