Nyesom Wike, governor of Rivers, is expected to meet with the members of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) in the national assembly. During the plenary session on Tuesday, Idris Wase, deputy speaker of the house, read Wike’s letter of request for a meeting with PDP lawmakers. The letter was signed by Nduli Elumelu, the minority leader of the house of representatives. The meeting is fixed for March 29, 2022 (today) and it will be held at Transcorp Hilton Hotel in Abuja at 7 pm. Wike announced his intention to contest the 2023 presidential election when he visited PDP stakeholders in Benue state on Sunday. The Rivers governor expressed confidence that PDP would win the presidency in 2023. “If you’re running in an election, power isn’t given for free; it is taken. I have come out and I’m going to take this power from APC back to PDP by the grace of God,” he had said. “God has given us what it takes. That’s why God is making APC to make mistakes everyday and that is how you know that God is with you. “Let me thank the people of Benue for receiving me to come and talk to them. I am declaring for the first time in Benue state because of my special relationship with them. People are merely not suspecting, but let it be known today that I am announcing it in Benue state because I have a special relationship with this state. “Today, you can’t talk about security in this country, and you must understand that without security, you can’t talk about governance.”
