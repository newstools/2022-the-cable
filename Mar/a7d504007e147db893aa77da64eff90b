A federal high court in Abuja has discharged and acquitted Kabiru Turaki, former minister of special duties and inter-governmental affairs, of money laundering charges. Turaki alongside three others were arraigned on May 4, 2020, on a 16-count charge bordering on unlawful and criminal misappropriation of funds to the tune of N715 million. Other defendants are Sampson Okpetu, who served as his special assistant, as well as Samtee Essentials Limited and Pasco Investment Limited — companies linked to Okpetu. The EFCC alleged that the ex-minister used the two companies belonging to his aide to illegally transfer funds. After the EFCC closed its case, rather than open their defence, the defendants filed a no-case submission. Delivering a ruling on the no-case submission filed by the defence, Inyang Ekwo, the presiding judge, said the EFCC failed to link Turaki and his co-defendants with the offences contained in the 16-count charge. He said the prosecution could not establish a prima facie case against them. Ekwo said the defendants countered the testimonies of the 12 witnesses called by the prosecution, describing them as “tainted”. The judge said it was established during cross-examination that Turaki was not a signatory to the account of the ministry and did not authorise any payment or make any transfer of funds. He agreed with the reasoning that the former minister was not a member of the ministerial tender board and that no monies were transferred from the ministry’s account to Turaki’s firm.
