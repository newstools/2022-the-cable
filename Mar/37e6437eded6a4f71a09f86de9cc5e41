Lucky Irabor, chief of defence staff, has assured Nigerians that peace will return to troubled parts of the nation this year. Irabor gave the assurance on Saturday in Abuja at the 2022 International Military Sports Council’s Day Run for the armed forces and security agencies. He said the world needs peace at this time, given the tension between Russia and Ukraine and the various security challenges confronting Nigeria. According to him, peace is returning to various troubled parts of Nigeria and the security forces have been playing their roles in addressing the challenges. On the exercise, Irabor said it was to help the personnel keep fit and enable them to continue the work of defending and protecting the country. “Beyond that, it also helps you to keep mentally alert because the job that you are involved in requires that your physical and mental well-being must be in top shape,” he said. “I am hopeful that for us in Nigeria, the peace that we have yearned for all these years will be a turning point this year. “Never again will we have the level of insecurity that we have had in the past and this is an assurance. “I also thank Nigerians for the support they have given to members of the armed forces and other security agencies in tackling insecurity in our country. “It is not yet over. We appeal for more support and I believe that Nigerians and of course, every other friend of Nigeria will support the armed forces to install an environment that is peaceful.”
