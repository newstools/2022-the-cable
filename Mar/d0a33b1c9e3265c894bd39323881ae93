The Abuja judicial panel established to probe police brutality has directed the National Drug Law Enforcement Agency (NDLEA) to produce Abba Kyari, suspended deputy police commissioner (DCP), on March 22. The #EndSARS panel, on Friday, also directed Tunde Disu, the head of the police intelligence response team (IRT), to ensure that Kyari is brought before the panel on the said date. On March 8, the panel ordered Usman Baba, inspector-general of police (IGP), to produce Danjuma Yakubu, Ibrahim Dani and Choji Dung, who were reportedly arrested in 2019 by operatives of the IRT, which was led by Kyari at the time. Following their arrest, the whereabouts of the three suspects have remained unknown, and the family members of the missing persons had petitioned the panel. According to NAN, a federal high court sitting in Gudu, FCT, had ordered the release of three victims. Speaking on Friday, James Idachaba, police counsel, told the panel that the police can no longer produce Kyari since he is no longer in their custody. Halilu Adamu, the panel’s counsel, told the panel that Kyari is currently in the custody of the NDLEA. On March 7, the suspended DCP was arraigned by the NDLEA over allegations of conspiracy, obstruction and dealing in cocaine. While issuing the order on Friday, John Martins, who represented Suleiman Galadima, retired justice who chairs the panel, said the petitioner’s witness had said Kyari promised to reach out to him over the missing persons. “The witness testified that Kyari allegedly promised to reach out to him in respect of the missing persons and till date nothing was heard about them,” NAN quoted him as saying. “The above order is made in respect of three persons who were allegedly arrested and detained by the IGP-IRT detention facility. “The whereabouts of Yakubu Danjuma, Ibrahim Daniel and Choji Dung are still unknown.”
