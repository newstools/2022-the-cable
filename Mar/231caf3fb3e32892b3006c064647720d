Sani Sidi, former director-general of the National Emergency Management Agency (NEMA, has returned to the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) from the All Progressives Congress (APC). In 2019, Sidi left the PDP for the APC after he lost the party’s governorship ticket to Isa Ashiru. The former NEMA DG was sacked by President Muhammadu Buhari in 2017 over the alleged theft of N1 billion, $284,000 and £95,000 from NEMA. On Saturday, Sidi visited the PDP secretariat in Kaduna central senatorial district, where his return to the PDP was made official. Addressing his supporters, the former NEMA DG asked party members to unite in order to achieve victory for the PDP in the 2023 elections. “There is no place like home. I am back home and for good. My ambition is no longer a rumour, I have just declared my aspiration in my ward,” he said. “I am now a member of PDP. I am just coming back home. We are consulting with stakeholders on my aspiration. “The leaders and stakeholders of PDP need to unite otherwise we would not succeed. We need to come together and work together, we must unite the party and forge ahead to ensure victory in the 2023 general election.”
