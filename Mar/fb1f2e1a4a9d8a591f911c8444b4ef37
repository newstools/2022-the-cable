President Muhammadu Buhari is still expected to travel to London, United Kingdom, for his medical checkup despite his surprise return to the country. The president’s aircraft touched down at the Nnamdi Azikiwe International Airport, Abuja, at about 1pm on Friday. Bashir Ahmad, personal assistant to the president on new media, had tweeted that Buhari’s arrival in the country. “President Muhammadu Buhari has returned to Abuja, after his participation in the 50th Anniversary of the UN Environmental Programme (UNEP) in Nairobi, Kenya,” he wrote on his Twitter handle. The president’s return took many by surprise, given the earlier spelt-out details of his itinerary. Femi Adesina, senior special adviser to the president on media and publicity, had announced the planned medical trip in a statement issued on Tuesday, March 1. “From Kenya, President Buhari will proceed to London for routine medical checks that will last for a maximum of two weeks,” Adesina had said. The trip to Kenya was for the 50th anniversary of the United Nations Environmental Programme (UNEP). In spite of his unexpected return to the country, TheCable understands that Buhari’s medical checkup has not been cancelled. According to a source in the presidency, the trip is “still on” and the president will see his doctors as planned. Barring any unforeseen circumstances, the president is expected to depart for London in the next couple of days, the source added.
