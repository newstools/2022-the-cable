Huawei Technologies Company Limited says it has developed an intelligent pipeline monitoring system to help tackle crude oil theft in Nigeria. Li Wei, director, Huawei Nigeria, disclosed this on Tuesday at a news briefing on the sidelines of the ongoing Nigerian International Energy Summit (NIES) in Abuja. He said this would promote oil productivity and solve other production and exploration problems. “Huawei-developed fibre vibration intrusion warning system uses Artificial Intelligence to identify intrusion scenarios accurately,” Wei said. “With high identification precision, accurate positioning, and quick response, it will help to ensure pipeline safety and reduce theft and vandalism. “In response to the strategy proposed by the Nigerian government and oil companies, Huawei promotes the digital oilfield Internet of Things and Exploration and Production storage solutions. “This will help oil and gas companies to achieve real-time visualised production, improve production efficiency, reduce production costs, and optimise production resource allocation to improve oilfield production.’’ He further said that the company would continue to support the digital transformation of Nigeria’s oil and gas industry by developing Information and Communications Technology (ICT) solutions. “Faced with the ongoing volatility of international oil prices, Huawei believes that the digital transformation of Nigeria’s upstream sector is a top priority,” he said. Wei also said the company is willing to provide high-quality information communication technology(ICT) services and solutions. He added that the company had signed an ICT academy agreement with more than 110 universities and schools and had trained more than 1,000 civil servants and 40,000 young students in Nigeria. “We hope to build a strong talent base camp to promote Nigeria’s digital economy development.’’
