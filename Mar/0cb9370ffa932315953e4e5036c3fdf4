The kingdom of Saudi Arabia has lifted all COVID-19 precautions at the Grand Mosque in Makkah and Prophet’s Mosque in Madinah. According to the country’s ministry of interior, worshipers will still have to wear masks as it is now mandatory in open and closed places. TheCable had earlier reported Saudi Arabia’s reversal of the travel ban on flights from Nigeria. In a series of tweets on Saturday, Saudi Press Agency (SPA) said workers had removed social distancing stickers from indoor and outdoor corridors in preparation for the Fajr (dawn) prayer. The ministry, however, mandated vaccination against COVID-19 and the use of Eatmarna or Tawakalana to obtain permits as proof of vaccination. In 2020, Saudi Arabia temporarily suspended Umrah for citizens and residents over fears of the spread of COVID-19, preventing visits to Prophet’s Mosque in Madinah. In October 2020, Saudi Arabia resumed Umrah after about seven months of suspension due to the global pandemic. Last year, the country’s interior ministry eased restrictions due to a decline in COVID-19 cases. In December 2021, Saudi Arabia reintroduced physical distancing in the two holy mosques.
