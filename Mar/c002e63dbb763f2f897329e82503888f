Four persons have been killed in Ibadan, the Oyo capital, following a robbery that took place in Omi Adio area of the state. Five point of sale (POS) operators were said to have been robbed when gunmen stormed Ladeowo area of Omi-Adio on Friday. Residents who spoke with TheCable said the robbers came on motorcycles and targeted POS operators in the area. A community leader in the area, who spoke on the condition of anonymity, said the robbers scared people away with gunshots, but youths in the area regrouped and chased them away. He, however, said four of the youths were shot dead during the pursuit. “They came on motorcycles and entered the community as if they came to drop passengers. It is not new for okada riders to come here and drop passengers from outside,” the community leader said. “Suddenly, they started shooting and moving from one POS operator to another, taking cash from them at gunpoint. They were shooting as they robbed the POS operators. “Residents ran away from the area but the youths were brave. They chased away the robbers. It was while chasing them that four of them were killed.” The community leader also said it was the second of such attack in the area within a month. “Last month, Saheed Lawal, who operated POS in Bako community, which is not far from this area, was killed in his house,” he said. “We call on the police to protect our communities from robbers who now target POS operators. We live on the outskirts of the city so we need more protection from raiders who sometimes come from neighbouring towns.” Adewale Osifeso, police public relations officer in Oyo state,  said investigation had begun into the attack.
