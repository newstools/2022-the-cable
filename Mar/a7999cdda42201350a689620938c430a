The railway station in Gidan, Kaduna state, has been invaded by gunmen. Details of the attack which occurred on Tuesday are still sketchy, and it isn’t yet clear if there were casualties. Innocent Ajiji, president of the Nigeria Union of Railway Workers, confirmed the development to TheCable. “We are yet to determine the extent of damage,” he said. The incident comes hours after an attack on a train in Kaduna, which left several people dead and scores injured. The train, which was attacked on Monday, was invaded by gunmen who also used improvised explosive devices (IEDs) on the rail tracks. Aside from those killed and injured, several persons are still missing, including Alwan Hassan, acting managing director/chief executive officer of the Bank of Agriculture (BOA). Following the incident, the Nigerian Railway Corporation (NRC) had announced the suspension of the Abuja-Kaduna railway operations. Also speaking on the development after a meeting with President Muhammadu Buhari on Tuesday, Lucky Irabor, chief of defence staff, said seven people were killed during the train attack. Irabor also said 29 people sustained injuries, while an unconfirmed number of persons were abducted. Meanwhile, the president has ordered security operatives to step up surveillance along the Abuja-Kaduna railway route.
