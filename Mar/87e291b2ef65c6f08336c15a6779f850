The Court of Arbitration for Sport (CAS) has upheld a ban imposed on Russian teams appearing in UEFA competitions. FIFA and UEFA had decided together that all Russian teams — whether national or club sides — be suspended from participation in their competitions until further notice after Moscow’s invasion of Ukraine. The sanction meant the Russian national team was thrown out of qualification for the upcoming Qatar 2022 World Cup while Spartak Moscow was disqualified from the ongoing Europa League competition. The Football Union of Russia (FUR), thereafter, appealed the decision to CAS while also seeking an immediate halt on the sanction before the appellate court starts proceedings. FUR’s request was, however, rejected on Tuesday with the court stating that the sanction will remain in full force until the case is heard and decided upon. “The President of the Appeals Arbitration Division of the Court of Arbitration for Sport (CAS) has denied the request filed by the Football Union of Russia (FUR) to stay, for the duration of the CAS proceedings, the execution of the UEFA Executive Committee’s decision to suspend all Russian teams and clubs from its competitions until further notice (the Challenged Decision),” read a statement by CAS. “Consequently, the Challenged Decision remains in force and all Russian teams and clubs continue to be suspended from participation in UEFA competitions. “The CAS arbitration proceedings continue. The parties did not agree to an expedited procedure and a hearing has not yet been fixed.”
