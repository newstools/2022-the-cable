Women groups across the country say they plan to hold a protest at the national assembly to call for a reconsideration of the gender bills rejected by the lawmakers. Abiola Akiyode-Afolabi, a Nigerian lawyer and civil rights activist, disclosed this on Tuesday at a virtual media briefing attended by civil society organisations (CSOs). Lawmakers, on Tuesday, voted against a bill seeking to provide special seats for women in the national and state houses of assembly. Also rejected was a bill seeking to “provide reserve quota” for women on appointments. Speaking at the media briefing, Akiyode-Afolabi said Nigeria women are disappointed by the actions of the national assembly. “The proposed gender bills in the constitution alteration bills that were all rejected are bills targeted at addressing the current gender imbalance across the legislative arm of governments across the country,  whilst reducing the under-representation of women in political office,” she said. “The men of the ninth national assembly, by their actions, have taken us backwards. Their actions undermine the importance and relevance of women’s contribution to the governance of Nigeria, including the key role women play to bring victory to political parties in elections at all levels across the country. “Nigerian women, therefore, demand that all gender bills be reconsidered. “We call on the national assembly to re-present these bills as a matter of urgency and ensure that they are passed.” The activist said the women will demand an urgent meeting with the leadership of the national assembly for them to reconsider the gender bills. She also said the women will use the following hashtags: #NigerianWomenOccupyNASS; #BreakPoliticalBias; and #BreakConstitutionBias, to push the demands on social media. She added that the protest will take place across various states, but that the meeting with the leadership of the assembly on Wednesday will determine what will happen at the state level.
