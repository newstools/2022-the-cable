The Zamfara government says it has recruited 4,200 community protection guards (CPG) as part of efforts to curtail the activities of bandits in the state. Ibrahim Dosara, commissioner for information, and Mamman Ibrahim Tsafe, commissioner for security and home affairs, spoke at a press briefing on Sunday. The commissioners said peace is gradually returning to the state in spite of the “activities of unpatriotic conflict entrepreneurs”. They said the 4,200 community protection guards comprise ex-servicemen, volunteers, and other residents. The commissioners said the CPGs will be supporting the state security operatives to confront the bandits in their enclaves. “It may interest you to note that these 4,200 CPGs have already commenced the basic training and are now collaborating with security operatives chasing the bandits,” they said. They assured that Zamfara would soon reclaim its lost glory as one of the most peaceful states in Nigeria. “Unknown to many Nigerians, bandits apart, there are some unpatriotic, conflict entrepreneurs politicians hell-bent to sabotage peace process out of their selfish desire either to gain power or to deter the successes of the governor for Zamfara state and its citizenry,” they said. “We wish to announce that, Insha Allah, Zamfara state will soon regain its lost glory as one of the most peaceful states in the federation. “It may interest you to also note that there is relative peace in almost all the northern parts of the state, with some few skirmishes here and there. I hold the belief that to succeed 100 percent in making a crime-free state will never be a one-day affair. “To buttress this claim, the Zamfara state government recently hosted a mammoth crowd in Gusau, the state capital, from within and outside the state. who came and lived in Gusau for a week without a single act of banditry against our visitors. “Interestingly, not a single visitor was troubled either on his way coming or going back to their destinations.”
