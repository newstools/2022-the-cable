The Federal Airports Authority of Nigeria (FAAN), on Tuesday, signed a memorandum of understanding (MoU) with the Lagos state government for the new airport Alimosho bypass project (AABP). Hadi Sirika, minister of aviation, signed on behalf of FAAN, while Babajide Sanwo-Olu, Lagos governor, signed for his state. The AABP is a four-phase project to decongest traffic on the Lagos-Abeokuta expressway. The 9km four-lane toll road along the Murtala Muhammed International Airport perimeter is the first phase. The second phase involves northern connection to the Lagos-Abeokuta expressway; phase three is the southern connection to Egbe road, and phase four is the southern extension to Isolo and Okota roads. According to a project overview document seen by TheCable, the AABP is aimed at easing traffic congestion often experienced on Lagos-Abeokuta expressway and its environs. “It entails the construction of a new 9Km toll dual carriageway express road from Shasha road to the airport toll road with immense commercial and economic benefits on completion,” the document reads. “It will increase revenue generated, reduction in travel time and vehicle operating costs, coupled with a reduction in accident occurrences just to mention a few.”
