About nine insurgents were reportedly killed on Tuesday when Boko Haram fighters clashed with members of the Islamic State in West Africa Province (ISWAP). The rival groups have been attacking communities in the north-east region since both camps fell apart over leadership issues. The groups have also since been having clashes, and Abubakar Shekau, leader of Boko Haram, was reportedly killed during one of such clashes in 2021. Meanwhile, the recent clash occurred less than 48 hours after suspected ISWAP fighters attacked another set of insurgents in Dikwa, killing about 17 of them. The Tuesday clash, sources said, happened when ISWAP fighters laid an ambush for Boko Haram fighters in Yauma Wango village in Borno state. This was said to have led to a gun battle between the two groups. The ISWAP fighters were said to have overpowered those of Boko Haram, killing many of them. Meanwhile, the Nigerian Air Force (NAF) said it killed scores of Boko Haram/ISWAP members on Wednesday in an air strike. The insurgents were said to be moving in vehicles within Sabon Gari in Damboa LGA of Borno state. The air strikes were said to have been conducted on the strength of credible intelligence which indicated that the insurgents were hibernating around Multe village, which is about 15 kilometers to Damboa. “They ran toward Wara Wara and Buracika,” a source said. In a similar development, troops of the Multi-National Joint Task Force (MNJTF) in Cameroon also killed several insurgents in Amchide town of Banki in Bama LGA of Borno state. The insurgents were said to have stormed the Nigeria-Cameroon border town on Tuesday, with five gun trucks and motorcycles. Sources said the insurgents targeted a military formation in the area, but the troops stationed at the location repelled the attack and killed many of the attackers.
