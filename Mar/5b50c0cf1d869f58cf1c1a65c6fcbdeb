Women groups protesting against the rejection of gender bills say they will hold protests in all states if the proposed laws are not passed within seven days. Abiola Akiyode-Afolabi, co-founder of Womanifesto, disclosed this on Wednesday at a media briefing in Abuja. TheCable had reported how federal lawmakers voted against bills seeking to provide more opportunities for women in governance. This led to an #OccupyNASS protest by women groups at the national assembly complex. However, after 10 days, the women suspended the protest on Tuesday following a promise by lawmakers to revisit the gender bills. Speaking on the development, Akiyode-Afolabi said women groups across the country will continue advocacy efforts to ensure that lawmakers attend to their demands. “We are determined to hold them accountable to their promises to ensure that within seven legislative days, the gender bills are recommitted and positively voted for the inclusive growth and development of Nigeria,” she said. “We have the commitment of women groups across Nigeria to support lobbying and advocacy to ensure that we reach as many NASS members as possible. “We also urge all Nigerians, especially women, not to give up hope as we shall continue to apply pressure to persuade the NASS to act responsibly. We will continue to engage the media and state assemblies to vote in favour of the gender bill.” When asked what the women will do if the national assembly does not keep its promise, Akiyode-Afolabi said the protests will continue. “We have occupied before. It won’t take us anything to occupy again,” she said. “We are going to occupy in a bigger way. We have started planning from state to state. It will not only be at the national assembly; we are going to occupy all the states in this country. It is not a matter of threat; it is a matter of affirming our presence in the country. So, it is not negotiable.”
