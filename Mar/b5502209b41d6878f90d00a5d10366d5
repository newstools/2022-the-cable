President Muhammadu Buhari has asked the senate to confirm four nominees for the Nigerian Upstream Regulatory Commission (NURC). Buhari’s request was contained in a letter read by Senate President Ahmad Lawan at the red chamber on Tuesday. The president premised his request on section 11(3) of the Petroleum Industry Act (PIA). “In accordance with the provision of Section 11(3) of the Petroleum Industry Act 2021, I hereby forward for confirmation by the senate, the appointment of the under-listed four nominees as executive commissioners for the Board of the Nigerian Upstream Regulatory Commission,” he said. The nominees are Nuhu Habib, commissioner, development and production; and Kelechi Onyekachi Ofoegbu, commissioner, economic regulation and strategic planning. The others are Tonlagha Roland John, commissioner, health, safety, environment and community; and Jide Adeola, commissioner, corporate services and administration. In another letter, Buhari asked the upper legislative chamber to confirm Hale Gabriel Longpet as the resident electoral commissioner (REC) representing Plateau at the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC).
