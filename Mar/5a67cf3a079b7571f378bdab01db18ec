Muhammad Abubakar, the Sultan of Sokoto, has asked the federal government to take urgent steps to address the high cost of food items in the country. The sultan spoke on Saturday at the closing ceremony of the 2022 national Qur’an recitation competition in Bauchi state. The event was hosted by the Bauchi state government in collaboration with Usman Dan Fodio University, Sokoto. Over recent months, Nigerians have been reeling from the effects of the hike in the cost of food prices. Speaking on the development, the sultan asked the federal government to work towards improving the economy, especially considering the forthcoming Ramadan season. Muslims across the world will observe a 30-day fasting period (Ramadan) beginning in April. “I think it is left to all of us in authority to work together and bring this rise in cost of foodstuffs to affordable levels, so that all of us can have a successful Ramadan,” NAN quoted him as saying. “I believe it’s not too much to ask government. After all, we elected you into office to serve us and not for us to serve you.” The sultan also called on traders to avoid increasing prices of foodstuffs during the fasting period. “I use this medium to call on all market people who sell things to be fearful of what Almighty God will ask them when they get to him on the day of judgment,” he said “Instead of increasing prices of foodstuffs and other essentials, please try to reduce the prices so as to get the blessing of Almighty God.” Speaking on the 2023 general election, he advised politicians to do away with desperate tendencies. “Do not make it a do-or-die affair because God already knows who is going to be the leader come 2023, whether at state or federal level,” he added.
