Maduka Okoye, Super Eagles number one goalkeeper, has been ruled out of the 2022 FIFA World Cup playoff against Ghana due to his COVID-19 diagnosis. A source close to Okoye told TheCable that the Sparta Rotterdam goalkeeper was unable to board his flight from Holland to Nigeria after testing positive to COVID-19. “Okoye is out of the FIFA World Cup play off against Ghana because he tested positive to COVID-19 and could not fly from Holland to Abuja for the two-legged games,” the source said. In his absence, John Noble, Enyimba International shot-stopper, has been asked by Augustine Eguavoen to join the team. As of lunchtime on Tuesday, 18 of the 25 invited players had arrived at The Wells Carlton Hotel and Apartments, Abuja. Nigeria and Black Stars of Ghana will clash at the 40,000–capacity Baba Yara Stadium on Friday evening — where both teams will battle for the ticket to Qatar. The return leg is scheduled to take place at the Moshood Abiola National Stadium four days later. Super Eagles already in camp: William Ekong, Leon Balogun, Oluwasemilogo Ajayi, Olaoluwa Aina, Frank Onyeka, Odion Ighalo, Daniel Akpeyi, Ahmed Musa, Oghenekaro Etebo, Kelechi Iheanacho, Abdullahi Shehu, Francis Uzoho, Moses Simon, Emmanuel Dennis, Joseph Ayodele-Aribo, Calvin Bassey, Innocent Bonke, and Kenneth Omeruo. Zaidu Sanusi, Akinkunmi Amoo, Samuel Chukwueze, Victor Osimhen, and Sadiq Umar will arrive at the camp on Tuesday evening while Ademola Lookman and Noble are expected to join their teammates on Wednesday.
