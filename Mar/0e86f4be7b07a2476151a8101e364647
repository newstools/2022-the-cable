VERIFICATION While the alleged video of the incident shows some individuals riding motorcycles on the runway, Amina Salami, the airport manager, in a phone interview with TheCable, said the gunmen fired shots into the runway from the fenced area and were later repelled by soldiers. “It wasn’t clear whether they wanted to come into the airport, but they shot a security guard on runway 05. Unfortunately, on their way to the hospital, he died,” she said. Findings by TheCable also showed that the video is not new. It has been on the internet since 2018. Invasion of airport runway in Sokoto state Nigeria by activists on motorcycles.#nigerianews #airportsecurity #SokoNews #NaijaVirals pic.twitter.com/W8l9ymqFRK — bibi olufore (@BOlufore) August 6, 2018  The incident in the video actually took place on August 3, 2018, when hundreds of people believed to be loyalists of a politician broke through the fence of the Sultan Abubakar III International Airport, Sokoto state, and invaded the runway to receive their principal. The Federal Airports Authority of Nigeria (FAAN) had condemned the incident. VERDICT The alleged video of terrorists attacking Kaduna airport is old footage. It is from an incident that happened at Sokoto airport in 2018.
