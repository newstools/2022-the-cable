There was a mild drama during plenary session on Wednesday as Idris Wase, deputy speaker of the house of representatives, commended his colleagues for their “patience” over the defective air conditioning system in the chamber. Wase made the remarks shortly before the adjournment of Wednesday’s plenary session. “Colleagues, thank you for the resilience and patience,” he said. TheCable understands that the cooling system in the lower legislative chamber had stopped functioning for at least one week. TheCable had observed various persons at the gallery grumbling about the scorching temperature in the chamber last Tuesday, as legislators were debating the clauses of the constitutional amendment bills. The gallery is a section in the chamber where visitors and journalists stay to observe proceedings. Wase, who presided over the plenary session on Wednesday, assured his colleagues that the national assembly management is working to restore the air conditioning system to a stable state. “We are still pleading with the management to work on the air conditioning system,” he said. “It has been very hot and very uneasy for us to work. But I believe we are doing this in the interest of our country. “I want to beg for your understanding and patience. The management is doing its best to ensure the problem is solved.”
