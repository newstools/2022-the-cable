The Nigeria Centre for Disease Control (NCDC) says 60 Nigerians evacuated from Ukraine have tested positive for COVID-19. On February 24, troops invaded Ukraine after Vladimir Putin, president of Russia, ordered a special military operation in Donbas, a separatist-held region in Ukraine. Since the invasion, there have been reported casualties from both countries, leading many residents of Ukraine, including Nigerians, to flee to neighbouring countries. President Muhammadu Buhari had approved the release of $8.5 million for the immediate evacuation of at least 5,000 Nigerians fleeing the Russian-Ukrainian conflict zone to Poland, Romania, Hungary, and Slovakia. The federal government had subsequently begun the evacuation of citizens with more than 1000 persons brought back to Nigeria over the past few days. In its COVID-19 update for Tuesday, the agency disclosed that some of the returnees tested positive for coronavirus on March 7. “68 cases reported for FCT for 7th March 2022; 60 of the cases are returnees from Ukraine,” the report reads. The World Health Organisation (WHO) had warned that the Russia-Ukraine war may result in the undetected transmission of COVID-19. Speaking at a press conference, Tedros Ghebreyesu, WHO director-general, said the organisation is deeply concerned about the unfolding humanitarian emergency in Ukraine. “Low rates of testing since the start of the conflict mean there is likely to be significant undetected transmission,” he said. As of March 8, a total of 254,777 cases, 249,209 discharges, and 3,142 deaths have been recorded in Nigeria.
