Glory Okolie, a 22-year-old woman arrested for being friends with a suspected member of the Indigenous People of Biafra (IPOB), has regained her freedom from custody. Harrison Gwamnishu, the activist who has been using his social media platforms to call for justice for Okolie, announced the release of the 22-year-old in a Facebook post on Wednesday. “FREEDOM AT LAST. More than four months in custody, Glory Okolie has been released from prison custody. Glory Okolie was accused of terrorism and being a member of IPOB by IGP IRT headed then by Abba Kyari,” the activist wrote. BACKGROUND TheCable had reported that the 22-year-old was arrested in Imo state by operatives of the police intelligence response team (IRT) on June 17, 2021 and transferred to Abuja. Her detention stirred public outcry but the police had said Glory was arrested over allegations of being a member of IPOB and working with one Benjamin Emojiri to attack officers and stations in Imo. “Police investigations revealed that Glory Okolie is a member of IPOB/ESN in Imo State who worked closely with one Benjamin Uzoma Emojiri a.k.a “Onye Army”, one of the ESN commanders earlier declared wanted by the Police for his lead roles in planning, coordinating and executing the attack on the Imo State Police Command Headquarters and Imo State Headquarters of the Nigerian Correctional Service,” the police had said. At the time, the 22-year-old had spent 66 days in detention. On August 27, 2021, a high court sitting in the federal capital territory (FCT) ordered the police to charge Glory to court by August 31 or release her. The court also ordered that she should be granted bail in the sum of N2 million, while a level 12 officer was expected to stand as surety.
