Manchester United lost 1-0 to Atletico Madrid in their UEFA Champions League round-of-16 second leg tie at Old Trafford to crash out of the competition on 2-1 aggregate. The Red Devils, who drew 1-1 in Spain, were expected to overcome a stubborn Atletico Madrid side, with Cristiano Ronaldo, United’s talismanic forward who scored a hat-trick over the weekend, in readiness for the showdown. However, the 37-year-old Portuguese forward was toothless as his rudderless Man United side succumbed to a 1-0 home defeat to crash out at the first knockout phase. Atletico Madrid started the better side, forcing David De Gea to a brilliant save before Joao Felix saw his strike chalked off due to offside in the buildup. Diego Simeone’s side deservedly took the lead on 41 minutes, with Renan Lodl heading into the net from Antoine Griezmann’s cross for a 1-0 lead at the interval. The Madrid side held on to the lead in the second period with Man United finding little joy in the attack. The late introduction of Juan Mata for Harry Maguire, Man United’s out-of-form captain, did not have any effect as Atletico Madrid closed out the win and advanced to the quarter-finals of the competition.
