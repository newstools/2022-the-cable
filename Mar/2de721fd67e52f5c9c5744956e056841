Kevin De Bruyne and Riyad Mahrez scored two goals apiece as Manchester City made light work of Manchester United with a 4-1 win on Sunday. Ralf Rangnick’s side, led by Harry Maguire, was comical in defence, and Man City took advantage in the fifth minute. Bernardo Silva and Jack Grealish worked the ball for De Bruyne to lash in a delightful finish into the bottom corner for his 50th league goal. Although Jason Sancho restored parity with a well-taken low curler on 22 minutes, De Bruyne restored City’s lead with another fine finish when Maguire failed to clear following a David De Gea save. While United offered threats as the half came to a close, Pep Guardiola’s side showed up in the second period in dominant fashion and Mahrez added a third goal on 68 minutes. The former Leicester City man put the icing on the cake with another neat finish for 4-1, capping a dominant display for the hosts. The victory sees Man City restore a six-point lead over Liverpool atop the English Premier League table with 69 points from 27 games, having played one more than their title rivals. Courtesy of the loss, Manchester United drop to the fifth position, with Arsenal moving up to fourth place after the Gunners’ 3-2 victory at Watford earlier in the day.
