Justice Christopher, former Super Eagles midfielder, has died at the age of 40. The former Nasarawa United defensive midfielder was pronounced dead on Wednesday at a hospital in Jos, Plateau state, where he was rushed to after he had slumped. A close associate of the late footballer, who confirmed his demise to TheCable, said Christopher had been battling high blood pressure (HBP) for a while. He, however, added that the late footballer was hale and healthy a day before his death. “Sad to report that my friend and former Super Eagles midfielder Justice Christopher passed on early this morning in Jos,” the close associate said. “He has had HBP for some time now. He was treating it. He was even at training yesterday morning.” Christopher made his debut for the Super Eagles during the 2002 World Cup qualifiers. He went on to secure a total of 11 caps for the team, including appearances in all Eagles matches at the 2002 Korea/Japan World Cup. Having begun his football career at Katsina United in 1999, he played for Sharks and Bendel Insurance, before moving to Belgium in 2001, and signing for Royal Antwerp. He also enjoyed spells with Levski Sofia in Bulgaria, Swedish club Trelleborgs FF, Alania Vladikavkaz in Russia and Herfølge BK in Denmark. He finally hung his playing boots in 2012 while in the books of Nasarawa United.
