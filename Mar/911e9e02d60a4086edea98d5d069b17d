President Muhammadu Buhari has asked the senate to confirm the appointment of two new members of the Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) of the Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN) and approve the reappointment of five members. Buhari’s request was contained in a letter read by Senate President Ahmad Lawan on the floor of the upper legislative chamber on Tuesday. The president based his request on section 5 (4) of the CBN Act. “Pursuant to section 5(4) of the Central Bank of Nigeria act, 2007, I am pleased to forward for confirmation by the senate of the underlisted two new members and the reappointment of five members of the Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) of the CBN,” Buhari said. “While hoping that this submission will receive the usual expeditious consideration of the senate, please accept, distinguished senate president, the assurances of my personal regards.” While Mohammed Salisu and Moa Ohaegbe are newly appointed, Buhari asked the upper legislative chamber to renew the appointment of Micheal Obada, Festus Adeola, Aliyu Sanusi, Robert Asuquo and Aliyu Ahmed.
