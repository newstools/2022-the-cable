Orji Uzor Kalu, chief whip of the senate, says the intervention of President Muhammadu Buhari in the crisis rocking the All Progressives Congress (APC) saved the party from disharmony. In a statement issued on Saturday, Kalu lauded Buhari for his leadership role in ensuring a peaceful national convention. There have been ripples within the party in recent times over consensus arrangements and the leadership of the caretaker committee, ahead of the APC convention holding today in Abuja. Buhari had waded into the crisis, and asked the governors elected on the platform of the APC to allow Mai Mala Buni, Yobe state governor, to plan the national convention. The president also met with APC members in the national assembly and other chieftains of the party on Thursday. Buhari urged APC stakeholders not to jeopardise the chances of the party ahead of the 2023 elections. Speaking on the development, Kalu expressed optimism that the convention would be successful, and called on members of the party to close ranks and remain committed to the party’s ideology. “I want to sincerely commend President Muhammadu Buhari for his quick and timely intervention in resolving the crises that rocked our great party,” Kalu said. “His intervention by inviting the various caucuses, stakeholders and leaders has brought in calm and unassuming peace which has rescued our party from disharmony. “Members of the party should demonstrate the spirit of love, peace and harmony as demonstrated by the president by embracing unity to help our party succeed in 2023 general election. “APC is one family and the president has done exceptionally well by meeting with the relevant stakeholders to resolve some of the crises rocking the party.” The former Abia governor also appealed to Buhari to help the APC resolve the pockets of crisis in some state chapters of the party.
