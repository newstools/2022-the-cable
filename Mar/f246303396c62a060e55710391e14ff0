Rochas Okorocha, senator representing Imo west, has urged Nigerians not to sell their votes in the 2023 general election. Okorocha gave the advice on Saturday while answering questions from journalists at the All Progressives Congress (APC) national convention in Abuja. The senator, who had recently declared his intention to run for president, said 2023 would present an opportunity for Nigerians to make the right choices. He said each permanent voter card (PVC) is worth over N100 million, and advised Nigerians against engaging in cheap trade with their votes. “Whether it is for internal democracy or for general elections,  you must ensure that you cast your vote right because the voter’s card contains everything,” Okorocha said. “It is the education of your children; it is your health, food on the table and security. So, I always advise people that the worth of that card in your hand is more than N100 million, so do not sell it for N10,000.” Commenting on his presidential aspiration, the senator said Nigerians love him because he is open to everyone, irrespective of tribe. “The people naturally love me and I think it is because they believe  I care; they believe I love and have sympathy for humanity; they believe I am detribalised,” he said. “They believe I do not  know religion or tribe; Muslim, Christian, Igbo, Hausa, Yoruba, all I see is a human being and that is what makes the  difference on my side.’’
