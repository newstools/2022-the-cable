Michael Ohiani, acting director-general of the Infrastructure Concession Regulatory Commission (ICRC), says Nigeria Air will begin operations before the end of President Muhammad Buhari’s administration. Ohiani disclosed this in a recent interview with NAN in Abuja. He said that ICRC is working closely with the ministry of aviation, adding that a new presidential approval had been given that would advance the process. Last year, Hadi Sirika, minister of aviation, had said the country’s proposed national carrier will take off by April 2022. He said the airline would commence operations with three wet-leased aircraft. Wet-lease is an arrangement covering the hire of an aircraft, including the provision of a flight crew and sometimes fuel. “I want to assure the Nigerian public that we are working round the clock to get it operational. We are working with the ministry of aviation and we have just gotten presidential approval,” Ohiani said. “We will get the concessionaire, once we have gotten the concessionaire which is a major step, the issue of operation will now follow. “I can assure you that before the end of this administration, Air Nigeria will start flying.” The ICRC acting DG also said plans are underway for the establishment of six cargo agro airports in the six geo-political zones. He said that the cargo airports were part of the commitment of the present administration to boost agriculture, adding that the airport would boost the transportation of farm produce within and outside Nigeria. He hinted that the cargo airport project is still in its development stage.
