Victor Osimhen, Super Eagles striker, scored twice to secure a comeback 2-1 win for Napoli in their Italian Serie A encounter against Udinese at the Stadio Diego Armando Maradona on Saturday. The 23-year-old’s goals came in the second half of the encounter as Napoli continued their push for a first Serie A title in 22 years. The brace brings the Nigerian forward’s tally to 11 league goals in an injury-ravaged season. He also makes history as the first Nigerian player to hit double figures in two different Serie A seasons. Osimhen headed in at the near post from a free-kick delivery to cancel Gérard Deulofeu’s first half strike on 52 minutes. The former Lille of France striker was at it 11 minutes later with the match-winning strike, employing the famed striker’s instinct to, again, find his way to the near post and dispatch Giovanni de Lorenzo’s low cross, sending the home crowd into frenzy mode. Osimhen’s goals are timely as he would be saddled with leading Nigeria in the two-legged Qatar 2022 FIFA World Cup qualification decider against the Black Stars of Ghana. The first leg will be held at the Baba Yara Stadium in Kumasi on March 25, while the second leg is billed for MKO Abiola National Stadium, Abuja, four days later. Osimhen and his fellow Eagles are expected to start arriving at the Super Eagles camp in Abuja from Sunday, March 20.
