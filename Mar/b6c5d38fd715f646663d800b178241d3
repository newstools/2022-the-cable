Like Minds for Peter Obi, a youth group, has purchased the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) presidential nomination form for Peter Obi, the former governor of Anambra state. The group bought the form at the PDP national secretariat in Abuja on Thursday. TheCable had, on March 24, reported Obi’s declaration of his interest in contesting the presidency in 2023. He said if given the opportunity to lead the country, he will unite Nigeria and ensure a steady inflow of investments. “We are too divided. I believe that the government I will lead will unite Nigeria. We need unity and peace for the progress of the country. I believe in Nigeria,” he had said. “We need security in order to attract local and foreign investments that will make Nigeria work. People need to live in a secure place.” Ekene Nwakuche, leader of Like Minds for Peter Obi, said members of the group are concerned about the state of the country and desire a technocrat as a leader. “We are just a group of Nigerian young professionals that feel the country is not going in the right direction and we need someone, a seasoned technocrat that can steer the affairs of the country in the right direction and cut down the cost of governance,” he said. “We believe if we cut down the cost of governance, the country will move in the right direction. We as professionals want the country to move forward and we think Peter Obi can steer it forward. “And we believe in him because we saw what he did in Anambra when he was the governor and we have heard him talk and we know he has the wealth of experience to lead Nigeria to the promised land.” Other PDP presidential aspirants include Atiku Abubakar, former vice-president, Anyim Pius Anyim, former senate president, Nyesom Wike, Rivers state governor, among others.
