During his famous inaugural speech, John Fitzgerald Kennedy, the 35th president of the US, urged Americans not to ask what their country can do for them, but what they can do for the country. Kennedy’s ideology of giving back to one’s country is the guiding principle of Obinna Gabriel, a National Youth Service Corps (NYSC) member who believes he must contribute positively to the development of any community he finds himself in, no matter what it takes. With this mindset, Gabriel was able to put smiles on the faces of residents of Ayegbami community in Kwara state. WHO IS OBINNA GABRIEL? Gabriel, 28, is serving his country in Ayegbami, Ilorin East LGA of Kwara state. The Enugu state indigene graduated from the department of mass communication, University of Benin. During his undergraduate days, he was the president of the Mass Communication Students Association (MACSA). He is also among the pioneer graduands of The School of Politics, Policy and Governance (SPPG), the leadership initiative of Oby Ezekwesili, a former minister of education. HOW HE SOLVED HOST COMMUNITY’S BIGGEST CHALLENGE Gabriel was posted to his place of primary assignment (PPA) — Iman Hamzat Model College in Ayegbami — in June 2021. After getting to the community, he observed that the major road was in a dilapidated state. As a development-oriented person, he met with some residents to determine whether the road was a top priority to them. During his meetings with residents, including their leaders, he was let in on the effects of the bad road; two children were said to have died in a flood and economic activities crumbled due to inaccessibility to seven neighbouring communities. “The first step in the execution of this project was a needs assessment. I already knew that this particular problem existed in Ayegbami but I needed to be very sure,” Gabriel told TheCable. “If you had read my tweet on the completion of this project, you would have observed that I started with the comment — this was the biggest challenge in Ayegbami. “That assertion came from that needs assessment. I went around the community meeting with people to understand the magnitude of the problem. I met with people who stay at home, people who sell things in shops, people in my PPA and community leaders.” After his meetings with the residents, they assured him of their support in proffering solutions to the problem. The community leaders also gave him a letter detailing the challenges faced as a result of the road. In July 2021, the corps member drafted a proposal for the project, which included the estimated budget. <img class="size-full wp-image-674311" src="https://f5p3e9e4.stackpathcdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/The-state-of-Ayegbami-road-before-Gabriels-advocacy.jpg" alt="" width="600" height="399" srcset="https://f5p3e9e4.stackpathcdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/The-state-of-Ayegbami-road-before-Gabriels-advocacy.jpg 600w, https://f5p3e9e4.stackpathcdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/The-state-of-Ayegbami-road-before-Gabriels-advocacy-300x200.jpg 300w, https://f5p3e9e4.stackpathcdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/The-state-of-Ayegbami-road-before-Gabriels-advocacy-24x16.jpg 24w, https://f5p3e9e4.stackpathcdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/The-state-of-Ayegbami-road-before-Gabriels-advocacy-36x24.jpg 36w, https://f5p3e9e4.stackpathcdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/The-state-of-Ayegbami-road-before-Gabriels-advocacy-48x32.jpg 48w" sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" /> The state of Ayegbami road before Gabriel’s advocacy. To get support for the project, Gabriel sent letters to several non-governmental organisations and business enterprises. He equally wrote to media organisations in order to create awareness for the plight of residents of Ayegbami. His initial plan was to crowdfund, but he changed gears after realising that it would be difficult to raise the estimated budget for the road project. In August 2021, a member of the community advised him to reach out to Abdulganiyu Cook Olododo, the federal lawmaker representing Ilorin East/South constituency. After contacting the lawmaker, Gabriel was invited to visit the constituency office to discuss the project. Courtesy of Gabriel’s intervention and advocacy, the construction of the road was added to the list of projects for the constituency in 2021. In September 2021, construction works started on the road, which brought excitement to the residents as their dream of having a good and accessible road was becoming a reality. In January 2022, the construction was completed — and it was a dream come true for residents of Ayegbami as their biggest challenge was finally in the rearview. The present state of Ayegbami road. <img class="alignnone wp-image-674316 size-full" src="https://f5p3e9e4.stackpathcdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/The-new-state-of-Ayegbami-road-1.jpg" alt="Obinna Gabriel" width="600" height="800" srcset="https://f5p3e9e4.stackpathcdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/The-new-state-of-Ayegbami-road-1.jpg 600w, https://f5p3e9e4.stackpathcdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/The-new-state-of-Ayegbami-road-1-225x300.jpg 225w, https://f5p3e9e4.stackpathcdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/The-new-state-of-Ayegbami-road-1-18x24.jpg 18w, https://f5p3e9e4.stackpathcdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/The-new-state-of-Ayegbami-road-1-27x36.jpg 27w, https://f5p3e9e4.stackpathcdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/The-new-state-of-Ayegbami-road-1-36x48.jpg 36w" sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" /> GABRIEL — THE PROBLEM SOLVER Speaking on his motivation, the 28-year-old corps member said he is always looking for problems to solve wherever he finds himself. He believes that he can always mobilise people to proffer solutions to daunting societal challenges. For Gabriel, the slogan is — to seek ways to solve problems instead of complaining. Obinna Gabriel. Gabriel did not stop at the advocacy intervention for road construction. He took up another project designed to keep Ayegbami clean, which he tagged as #CleanUpAyegbami. The corps member designed the project after he observed that Ayegbami was in a “serious environmental mess” as all open spaces were used as dumpsites. For the project, he sensitised residents of the Kwara community on the importance of cleanliness and evacuation of waste. Although his work in Ayegbami thrust him into the spotlight, Gabriel’s knack for development advocacy did not start there. As a departmental president in UNIBEN, he established the first library in the institution’s department of mass communication — and also mobilised students to donate books to set up the library. “I’m not the type who would rather complain than look for solutions,” Gabrial added.
