Rabiu Kwankwaso, former governor of Kano state, has resigned his membership of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP). Kwankwaso announced his decision to leave the party in a letter addressed to the PDP chairman in his ward. The development comes days after Abba Yusuf, Kwankwaso’s son-in-law, defected to the New Nigeria Peoples Party (NNPP). The former governor said he is leaving the party with immediate effect as a result of “some serious and irreconcilable differences”. “May I begin by thanking my ward chairman, friends and well-wishers of my ward, state and indeed, the country and beyond, for the very respectful relationship we have had,” the letter reads. “It is with a deep sense of responsibility that I write to notify you that, as a result of some serious and irreconcilable differences, I have reached the conclusion that my continued stay in PDP is untenable. “Therefore, effective from today, Tuesday, March 29, 2022, I have withdrawn my membership from Peoples Democratic Party (PDP).” Although Kwankwaso is yet to announce the party he is joining, he is said to be considering defecting to the NNPP. He had recently launched The National Movement (TNM), a political organisation. Speaking at the unveiling ceremony of the TNM, Kwankwaso had said members of the group “are ready with concrete and incontrovertible measures to pull our nation out of the doldrums”.
