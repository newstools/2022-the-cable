A political group, The Osinbajo Think Tank (TOTT), says Vice-President Yemi Osinbajo is the only Nigerian that can turn around the fortune of the country. The group through its co-convener, Olugbenga Olaoye, said this on Saturday during an event in Akwa Ibom tagged ‘The Uyo Declaration’. TOTT and different groups under the aegis of The New Tribe converged in the state to endorse the vice-president. “At TOTT, we came together to promote the candidacy of Prof. Yemi Osinbajo. I will refer to him as Mr Capable. He is the only one that can turn around the fortune of this nation,” Olaoye said. He said Osinbajo meets all the criteria needed to drive a new Nigeria, adding that TOTT is a representation of varied interests in the corporate space, who came together to promote the candidacy of Osinbajo. “Osinbajo has been there, and he has seen a lot in the government circle. He has the experience, he knows the law, and understands the economy and international jurisprudence,” he said. “If we give this man the chance to lead us, in the next dispensation, Nigeria will be great again. “He is a detribalised Nigerian. He is much loved and trusted in the north, where his duty as the vice-president has taken him to, many times. “Prof. Yemi Osinbajo has bold and innovative ideas on solving the challenges facing the country. He definitely will improve security in the country.”
