The Nigerian Army has disowned an online recruitment portal claiming that the security agency is currently recruiting. On Thursday, there were posts on social media platforms claiming that the army was recruiting for the “83 regular course”. Reacting to the development, Onyema Nwachukwu, army spokesperson, in a statement, said the information is false and intended to mislead the public. “The Nigerian Army (NA) has been notified of a fake online recruitment portal being circulated on the social media and other online platforms fraudulently advertising recruitment of candidates into NA 83, regular recruit intake,” the statement reads. “Following this unwholesome development, the NA wishes to clearly inform the general public that there is no ongoing recruitment, as published in the fake portal. “The information is false, misleading and aimed at defrauding unsuspecting members of the public. “The general public is therefore enjoined to be wary of fake online recruitment vendors who are desperately hunting for victims. “The general public should please note that recruitment advertisements placed by the Nigerian Army are usually published in national dailies. “We advise members of the public to shun the portal in its entirety.”
