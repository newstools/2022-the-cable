The Nigerian Young Professionals Forum (NYPF), a socio-political group, has launched the Green Nigeria Movement (GNM) to encourage active youth participation in politics. The forum launched the movement on Thursday in Kano. The GNM is an initiative of the NYPF that seeks to enlighten voters on the need to participate actively in the forthcoming elections. Moses Siasia, the convener of GNM and chairman of the forum, said the movement will enable the mobilisation of youths to raise over 10 million votes for a presidential candidate of their choice. Siasia expressed concern over the socio-political impact of bad leadership on the younger generation, adding that it is time for youths to take more interest in politics. “If you go to our prisons today, you will see a large number of young people,” he said. “As young people, we need to form a common front to pursue a collective goal for this country. We must bring people together to ensure that we install a true leader as president in 2023. “The time for traditional political professionals is over. Now, it is time for professionals to take over the political scene and give hope and motivation to the Nigerian masses.” On his part, Hamzat Lawal, chief executive officer of Connected Development (CODE) and co-covener of GNM, said the movement will also encourage more women to participate in politics. “We shall make Nigeria great again. We will not support analogue people again, but digital leaders who have achieved success and have identified with the aspirations of the common masses,” he added. “We need a new set of true leaders; we need technocrats. We want to see a new president that will bring the needed growth and sustainable development. Nigeria needs help.”
