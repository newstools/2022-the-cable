Aliyu Aziz, director-general of the National Identity Management Commission (NIMC), says the National Identity Number (NIN) should become a mandatory requirement for accessing government services. He said this while requesting the support of the Bureau of the Public Services Reforms (BPSR) on Thursday in Abuja. The director-general led a delegation of NIMC management on a visit to Dasuki Arabi, the director-general of BPSR, where he made the appeal. Aziz expressed NIMC’s gratitude to BPSR for enabling the adoption of NIN in JAMB’s Unified Tertiary Matriculation Examination (UTME) and the issuance of travel passports by the Nigerian Immigration Service (NIS), according to NAN. He said the number of Nigerians who enrolled for NIN had risen from seven million in 2015 to 75 million this year. Aziz also added that NIMC had developed a mobile app with which members of the general public can access vital information about their NIN enrolment and print out. On his part, Arabi commended the NIMC’s director-general for the ‘remarkable’ work he is doing to actualise the corporate mandate of the Commission and to also facilitate the enrolment of millions of Nigerians into its citizens’ database. He called on other management staff of NIMC to give their support to the director-general, adding that he has remained steadfast and committed to actualising the visions and missions of the commission. He further said BPSR was ready to deploy its Self-Assessment Tool (SAT) programme on NIMC to identify areas of weakness and challenges facing the commission.
