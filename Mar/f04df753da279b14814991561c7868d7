The Lagos State Traffic Management Authority (LASTMA) says two of its officers have been dismissed over misconduct. Olumide Filade, assistant director, public affairs, LASTMA, confirmed the development in a statement on Monday. According to the statement, the LASTMA officers were sanctioned after facing a disciplinary committee. The agency said while two officers had their appointments terminated, four others were demoted. The officers were said to have faced sanctions over allegations on “bribery, corruption and serious act unbecoming of public officers”. The LASTMA management said the disciplinary action taken was in line with the Lagos state civil service rules and regulations. The identities of the affected officers were, however, not disclosed. “This is necessary in order for all of us to promote a greater Lagos for the benefit of all and for the realisation of Mr Governor, Babajide Olusola Sanwo-Olu’s objectives in the first letter of the ‘THEMES’ agenda (Traffic Management and Transportation),” the statement reads. “We wish to add by informing well-meaning and concerned Lagos residents and the motoring public that we have various windows through which complaints can be channeled for prompt action. “Such complaints shall be investigated dispassionately with despatch, 08129928490 and 08129928515; while comptrollers could be reached via: 08129928448, 08129928749, 08129928512, 08129928542 and 08023270248. “The management therefore enjoined the general Lagos road users to abide by the State Transportation Sector Reform Law 2018 as amended by the Lagos State House of Assembly. “Anyone caught on the wrong side of the law will be made to face the full wrath of the law.”
