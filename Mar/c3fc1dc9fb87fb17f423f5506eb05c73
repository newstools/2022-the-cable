Cristiano Ronaldo scored a hat-trick as Manchester United defeated Tottenham Hotspurs 3-2 in their English Premier League (EPL) encounter at Old Trafford on Saturday evening. The Portuguese superstar’s latest hat-trick is the 59th of his glistening career and one that returned Man United to winning ways following a demoralising derby loss to Man City last weekend. The five-time Ballon d’Or winner also bagged another milestone in his career as he broke the FIFA record for the most goals in competitive matches in football history. The Real Madrid all-time record goalscorer’s hat-trick sees him accumulate 807 career goals, surpassing the long-standing record of 805 goals previously held by Josef Bican of Czechoslovakia. Ronaldo opened the floodgates in the 12th minute with a well-taken long-range strike from outside the area that nestled into the top corner. The 37-year-old was then on hand to slot home Jadon Sancho’s cross to regain the lead for Man United on 38 minutes. This was after Harry Kane had earlier dispatched a penalty kick awarded for a handball by Alex Telles to restore parity for Tottenham. Harry Maguire, Man United’s captain who has been in poor form, continued his atrocious performance, gifting Tottenham another equaliser with an own goal on 72 minutes. Ronaldo, however, completed his hat-trick with a well-placed header to seal Man United’s 3-2 victory. The win takes Man United back to fourth place with 50 points from 29 matches, two more than Arsenal who have played four games less. RESULTS
