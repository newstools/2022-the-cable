Nathaniel Ikyur, chief press secretary to Samuel Ortom, Benue governor, says gunmen attacked some villages in the state and “killed many” people. In a statement on Thursday, Ikyur said some villages in Guma LGAs were attacked in the early hours of Wednesday. The CPS said the attackers came from outside Benue to wreak havoc on the communities. “The latest attack which claimed several lives took place at Ye village, along Daudu-Gbajimba road in Guma Local Government Area,” he said. “The assailants also attacked branch Udei and killed more than four people and injured many who have been taken to a nearby health centre. “The gunmen who invaded the villages in the early hours are believed to have crossed over from a neighbouring state into Benue to wreak the unprovoked murder on the villagers. “The invaders were said to have first of all shot sporadically into the air before breaking into the houses of their victims who were already fast asleep.” He added that the development is coming amid attacks on borders around Benue state in recent times. According to Ikyur, Ortom condemned the attacks and urged the federal government to take measures to prevent such invasions of communities in the state. “I have repeatedly called on the federal government to convoke a national security summit of all ethnic nationalities to find lasting solutions to the increasing wave of terrorism that is gradually tearing up the bond in our nation,” the governor was quoted as saying.
