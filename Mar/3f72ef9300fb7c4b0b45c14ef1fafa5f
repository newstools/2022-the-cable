Maduka Okoye, Super Eagles goalkeeper, confronted a pitch invader on Friday night after he was hit by an object during a Dutch league game. The incident took place during the match between Sparta Rotterdam, Okoye’s club, and Vitesse Arnhem. Following the violent behaviour of Vitesse Arnhem’s fans, the centre referee ended the match before the seven minutes injury time was exhausted. According to a statement issued by the Eredivisie, the league’s governing body, the match was discontinued due to multiple crowd troubles, including the use of flares. Okoye’s Sparta Rotterdam was leading 1-0 when tension boiled over, chiefly due to the superb performance from the goalkeeper. The 22-year-old saved a penalty on 65 minutes and successfully stopped nine shots from finding their target. Okoye’s eventful evening went from superb to worrisome when he was first hit by an object thrown from the crowd in the first minute of added time before being confronted by a pitch invader a minute later. wat een aansteller ook al die kiepert, terwijl het glas op z’n schouder komt.
