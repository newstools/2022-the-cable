The Nigeria Immigration Service (NIS) says 84 border locations in Nigeria will soon be linked with e-border monitoring cameras to check issues of illegal immigrants and other criminal activities. Idris Jere, acting comptroller general of NIS, spoke on Wednesday in Ibaka Mbo LGA area of Akwa Ibom after a tour of facilities of the control post in the command. Isah said the implementation of the e-border monitoring would kick-start from second quarter of 2022. He said the federal government has already signed an agreement with a Chinese company for the installation of the surveillance cameras across the locations. According to him, when the operations commence, monitoring of borders across the country would be realtime online, using information and communications technology (ICT) system. Jere added that the protection of the country’s borders against illegal immigrants and other criminal activities require the support of all Nigerians. “The federal government signed the e-border agreement with a Chinese company to supply cameras in about 84 locations of our borders, to use ICT as a tool to monitor our borders, because our border are massive. So, it is only with ICT that we can monitor our borders effectively,” Idris said. “Of course, ICT requires money and we are going to be all time online. The president has equally approved the construction of our data communications centre in Abuja. It is a pilot product where we can view what is happening at Illela in Sokoto live. “If they have connected Ibaka to our communications centre, you can see what we are doing here, realtime online. That’s what the government is doing. “So, government is doing well and it requires the support of the communities. Support of the Nigerians to achieve complete security of the nation. I assure you by second quarter of this year the implementation will start.”
