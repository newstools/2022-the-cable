Sobanke Adereti, a 24-year-old Nigerian, has been sentenced to 33 months in prison over passport falsification and bank fraud in the United States of America. Jeremy Kernodle, a US district judge, announced the verdict on Wednesday. According to a statement by the US department of justice, the Nigerian was indicted for federal violations by a grand jury on April 7, 2021. He was said to have pleaded guilty to passport fraud and attempted bank fraud on October 25, 2021. Court documents reportedly indicated that Adereti presented a false passport and a falsely procured certified check when trying to open a bank account in Flower Mound, Texas. The check was said to have been purchased by a fraud victim who was deceived into sending money to the Nigerian who had falsely identified himself as “Robinson Elijah”. “When Adereti was arrested, he had additional passports and bank statements in other names in his possession. Investigators determined that Adereti was also connected to scams related to business email compromise fraud and other government program fraud,” the statement reads. “Additionally, evidence showed that Adereti was the son of a Nigerian traditional ruler and entered the United States on a visitor’s visa in 2018, which has since expired.” Speaking on the development, Brit Featherston, US attorney, commended the banks that assisted in ensuring Adereti’s arrest. “Scams to steal money are around every corner. Thanks to the keen eye of bank officials, Adereti was apprehended. Unfortunately, many of these crimes target our vulnerable elder population. It is up to all of us to share this awareness and look out for our greatest generation,” Featherston said.
