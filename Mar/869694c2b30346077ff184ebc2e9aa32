Karim Benzema scored a second half hat-trick as Real Madrid came from one goal down to defeat Paris Saint-Germain (PSG) 3-1 in their UEFA Champions League (UCL) round-of-16 second leg clash at the Santiago Bernabeu stadium on Wednesday night. The win overturned a 1-0 deficit from the first leg in Paris, ending the entertaining encounter 3-2 on aggregate in favour of Carlo Ancelotti’s Real Madrid who advance into the quarter finals of the competition they have won 13 times. PSG took the lead through Kylian Mbappe, with the French prodigy slamming in at the near post on the counter after being sent through on goal by Neymar. The Parisians had chances to extend their lead but failed in front of goal, while Real could not muster clear-cut opportunities in a sluggish first half display. The second half saw Real Madrid — with a double change on 57 minutes — take the game by the scruff of the neck, with Benzema coming to the fore. The captain led the press that forced Gianluigi Donnarumma, PSG goalkeeper, into a mistake that gave Madrid their first goal. The former Lyon youngster handed Real the lead on 77 minutes, hitting a shot that took a slight deflection on its way into the net, and then completed his hat-trick straight from kick-off following another mistake in PSG’s defence to become the oldest player to score a hat-trick in UCL history.
