The Kaduna government has set up a committee to look into the attacks in Jema’a, Kaura, and Zangon Kataf LGAs of the state. The committee was set up on Thursday during a stakeholders peace dialogue in the state. Hadiza Balarabe, the deputy governor, said the committee it is meant to find out the “immediate and remote” causes of the recurrent violent conflicts in communities in the affected LGAs. She asked that the committee should also recommend measures to foster peaceful and harmonious coexistence in the communities. Balarabe, who condoled with affected communities, directed the three LGAs chairmen to resume weekly meeting with security committees in a bid to proactively tackle problems before they escalate. She said the State Emergency Management Agency (SEMA) will provide relief materials to victims of the attack. Samuel Aruwan, commissioner of internal security and home affairs, asked farmers and herders to always report to security agencies whenever there are issues among them. “As we always stated, when farmers have issues with herders, the position of the government is that they should report to the security agencies, and not to resort taking the law into their hands,” he said. “Similarly, when herders have issues with anybody while grazing, they should never take revenge but report to the security agencies.’’ The committee will be chaired by Phoebe Sukai Yayi, administrator of Kafanchan municipal authority, alongside the chairmen of Jema’a, Kaura and Zangon Kataf LGAs. Other members of the committee are representatives of Jama’a tul Nasir Islam (JNI), Christian Association of Nigeria(CAN) and the affected communities. The committee is expected to submit its report within one week.
