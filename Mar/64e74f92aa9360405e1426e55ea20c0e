The African National Congress (ANC) says the removal of Russia Today (RT) from the list of Multichoice channels available for viewership is an infringement on the people’s rights. South Africa’s ruling party said the decision to withdraw the TV station has negatively impacted “the freedom of choice to subscribers”. In a statement issued on Saturday, Paul Mabe, ANC spokesperson, said the development limits subscribers’ consumption of news on the developments in the Ukraine-Russia conflict. “The ANC believes that this censorship act done in bad faith during human rights month in South Africa undermines subscribers freedom of association and negatively impacts on the need for plurality of views and media freedom which is sacrosanct and provided for in our constitution,” the statement reads. “The reasons conveyed by MultiChoice in seeking to justify this censorship act are quite bizarre and lack any legal and humane justification. “Stifling the plurality and diversity of views undermines internationally agreed principles on freedom of speech, choice and association. “The ANC condemns in the strongest terms possible any form of bias by media conglomerates in South Africa which limits the plurality and diversity of views. “Even at this late hour, the EU must still provide legal justification for this course of action. “Our own competition commission should also act to safeguard the interest of subscribers of Multichoice by quantifying the loss and demanding of such to be reimbursed. “The ANC also calls on Multichoice to reconsider its decision of censorship and immediately reinstate Russian TV on its platform.” Governments across the world have been ramping up sanctions against Russia over its invasion of Ukraine. In the past few days, global corporations, including car manufacturers and energy giants, have severed business ties with Russia.
