There was drama at the convention of the All Progressives Congress (APC) as Mary Ekpere-Eta, an aspirant for the office of national woman leader of the party, refused to withdraw from contesting. Ekpere-Eta, a former director-general of the National Centre for Women Development (NCWD), announced her decision in the early hours of Sunday during the ongoing APC convention in Abuja. According to an ‘endorsement list’ of consensus candidates released earlier on Saturday, Betta Edu was adopted as candidate for the office of national woman leader. The adoption of Edu comes despite the controversy over whether she resigned her position as Cross River commissioner for health before seeking to run for the position of national woman leader. Edu had, however, said she resigned as commissioner “weeks ago”. At the convention, aspirants took turns to announce their intentions to withdraw from contesting different positions. While that was going on, Alphonsus Eba, APC chairman in Cross River, climbed the stage and announced that Ekpere-Eta had withdrawn from the contest. But Ekpere-Eta mounted the stage immediately afterwards and insisted that she was still in the race. “I will never and cannot withdraw from the race,” she said. See video below.
