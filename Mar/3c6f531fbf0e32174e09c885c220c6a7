Nigeria has become the first country in Africa to launch an updated version of the energy calculator 2050 (NECAL 2050), an energy and emissions model to assist Nigeria in achieving its climate goals. NECAL was launched in Abuja on Monday by the Energy Commission of Nigeria (ECN), the ministry of environment and the British high commission. In 2013, the British department of energy, through the British high commission to Nigeria, introduced the energy calculator to Nigeria and supported the ECN to adapt and produce the initial phase of the Nigeria Energy Calculator 2050 (NECAL 2050), which was launched in 2015. This updated NECAL version aims to help industries and the energy sector to set greenhouse gas emission reduction targets, as well as identify solutions that will support the implementation of Nigeria’s climate commitments. Sharon Ikeazor, minister of state for environment, said the ministry will leverage on this tool to make decisions and policies for the implementation of Nigeria’s nationally determined contributions (NDCs) “As we gather to launch the 2nd Edition of the Nigeria Energy Calculator NECAL2050, I am more elated knowing that the completion of this policy tool could not have come at a better time than now,” she said. “The Ministry as the national coordinating body of climate activities will leverage on this tool for policy and decision making for the implementation of Nigeria’s long-term strategy for climate change under the Paris Agreement, as well as identify realistic solutions towards supporting the implementation of Nigeria’s NDCs.” Ogbonnaya Onu, minister of science, technology and innovation, said the energy calculator is a tool that will enable the monitoring of choices and environmental consequences of the energy development pathway, adding that it will reflect Nigeria’s commitment to a clean, sustainable energy future. Catriona Laing, British high commissioner, said: “Nigeria’s energy sector accounts for 60 percent of total greenhouse gas emissions and the sector is also key to the delivery of Nigeria’s many development priorities; it is therefore critical to understand the options that are available to reduce emissions while matching energy supply and demand.” NECAL was delivered under the UK government’s international 2050 calculator programme, which is funded by the UK’s International Climate Finance, and led by Mott MacDonald, a global engineering, management and development consultancy.
