President Muhammadu Buhari says Grace Alele-Williams, renowned mathematician, provided inspiration for many women in Africa. Alele-Williams, the first female vice-chancellor of a Nigerian university, died on Friday. She was aged 89. In a statement issued on Saturday by Femi Adesina, presidential spokesperson, Buhari expressed his condolences to her family and associates. He said she was outstanding in her accomplishments, adding that her diligence in service would forever be recognised. “The President affirms that Prof. Alele-William’s achievement in scholarship and administration removed the glass ceiling for many women in Nigeria, Africa and the black race, and continues to inspire a generation who have found their passion and voice in research, teaching and lifting the nation with ideas, especially in science and technology,” the statement reads. “President Buhari believes the scholar’s brilliance and outstanding character reflected in every opportunity and position she served, particularly playing a major role in the educational development of the country, and serving as a consultant to many international institutions, including UNESCO. “As the first female to obtain a doctorate degree in Nigeria, 1963, and first female VC of the University of Benin, 1985, the entire country will sorely miss the scholar, and cherish the memories of her diligence, discipline and refreshing candour.” You can read more on her achievements here.
