Bola Tinubu, a former governor of Lagos, has congratulated Abdullahi Adamu, the new chairman of the All Progressives Congress (APC). Adamu was the preferred candidate of President Muhammadu Buhari for the party’s chairmanship. Tanko Al-Makura, an ally of Tinubu, withdrew from the chairmanship contest shortly before the APC convention that was held on Saturday. In a statement on Monday, Tinubu said Adamu’s wisdom “will be a great asset to the APC in the crucial moments ahead”. The presidential aspirant also said the new members of the national working committee (NWC) should work together for the benefit of the party. “President Muhammadu Buhari deserves commendation for his leadership. Deserving citations are members of the Caretaker and Extraordinary Convention Planning Committee for carrying out the vital assignment of planning and conducting the March 26 National Convention,” he said. “We acknowledge the caliber of men and women elected to the leadership positions of the party as pledged. We encourage them to work in unity toward our common purpose. In this way, victory for the party and excellent governance for the Nigerian people shall be assured. “Congratulations to the new National Chairman, Alhaji Abdulahi Adamu, who like me is a team builder and former governor. He also is an experienced administrator and able statesman. “I applaud every member of the new leadership and wish them well in their assignments. “The new leadership and party members must work together in common purpose with commitment to ensure another resounding victory at all levels for the APC in 2023.” Tinubu also said the progress of the country depends on the APC. “The future stability, progress and prosperity of Nigeria depends substantially on the democratic commitment and efficacy of the APC,” he added. “We must all come together to ensure the party keeps faith with its promise to the Nigeria people by creating a more prosperous, secure and just society for all.”
