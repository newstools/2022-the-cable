John Akpanudoedehe, national secretary of the All Progressives Congress (APC) caretaker committee, says he has not resigned from office. Akpanudoedehe said this in reaction to reports that he has resigned his position. The former senator has come under scrutiny after a “plot” by Mai Mala Buni, Yobe governor, to scuttle the party’s forthcoming convention was discovered. On Monday, Abubakar Sani Bello, governor of Niger, had presided over a meeting of the APC caretaker committee, adding that he had been in charge of the party’s affairs “for a while”. Speaking on Tuesday at a media briefing in Abuja, the secretary said he and Buni would resign from office if President Muhammadu Buhari asks them to do so. “I want to state that it is not true; I haven’t resigned,” he said. “If I have resigned, you will see the resignation letter from me. Someone cannot say someone is dead while he is alive. I am not bigger than the party. I’m waiting for my national chairman to come back. “We have done so much for this party. When we inherited, you can recall it (APC) was at its lowest ebb. We were able to cover some grounds and register 41 million people. We also have been able to buy the secretariat. “This is not the first time we have seen power play. I’m waiting for the chairman (Buni). If we have directives from Mr President that we should resign, we are not bigger than the president; we would do so.”
