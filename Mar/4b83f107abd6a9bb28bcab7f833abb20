The Nigerian Army says troops of operation Desert Sanity have discovered workshops for making improvised explosive devices (IED) in Sambisa forest. The army disclosed this on Saturday in a post on its social media pages. “In continuation with the ongoing clearance operations, Gallant troops of Operation Desert Sanity today conducted further exploitation around Ukuba/Camp Zairo in Sambisa Forest and discovered IED making workshops of BokoHaram/ISWAP,” the post reads. The development comes hours after a police anti-bomb squad discovered and defused an IED in Danmani community in Rigasa, Igabi LGA of Kaduna state. This came after some residents in the area had sustained injuries following an explosion earlier on Friday. According to Samuel Aruwan, Kaduna commissioner for internal security and home affairs, the explosion was said to have been caused by an IED planted in a motorcycle belonging to one Mohammed Hassan, a POS operator in the area. “According to preliminary investigations, Hassan, at the close of work, went to pick up his motorcycle where it was parked close to the shop, and upon starting the motorcycle, it exploded,” the commissioner said. “The explosion resulted in serious injuries to Hassan and a yet-unidentified passer-by. There was also damage to the roof of a nearby structure.”
