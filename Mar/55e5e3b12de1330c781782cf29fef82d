Umar Danbatta, executive vice-chairman, Nigerian Communications Commission (NCC), says the advancement of the country’s digital transformation is through its long-standing membership in the International Telecommunication Union (ITU). Ikechukwu Adinde, NCC director of public affairs, disclosed this in a statement released on Friday. He said as a member of the ITU, the commission has benefited by serving as a booster for effective implementation of government policies as well as promoting digital transformation. He added that the aftermath of the COVID-19 pandemic improved the role of ICT in ensuring peace, security and prosperity around the world. “The Nigerian Communications Commission’s (NCC) vast experience as a long-standing member of the International Telecommunication Union (ITU) has served as a booster to the Commission in its effective implementation of government policies, and in stimulating regulatory initiatives focused on advancing Nigeria’s digital transformation,” he said. “It is as a result of the enabling experiences in the ITU ecosystem that Nigeria continues to be active and forward-looking regarding the activities of the ITU as the leading organ of the United Nations (UN) in the area of ICT. “As a long-standing member of Council, Nigeria has utilised ICT as a driver of socio-economic development not just for herself, but also for the benefit of the sub-region and the continent, given its role as a founding member and flagship promoter of the West African Telecommunications Regulators Assembly (WATRA).” Danbatta also said the country seeks to be re-elected to ITU Council during the forthcoming plenipotentiary conferences. He said the re-election would help to collaborate and support ITU’s development agenda. “We look forward to a robust council session and subsequent support for Nigeria during the forthcoming elections,” Danbatta added.
