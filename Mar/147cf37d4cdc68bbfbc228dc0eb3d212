Another batch of Nigerian evacuees from Ukraine have arrived. The evacuees arrived at the Nnamdi Azikwe International Airport Abuja around 00:30 am on Sunday, according to the Diaspora Commission (NiDCOM). The commission said they arrived via Air Peace Boeing 777-300 Flight APK7534 from Budapest Hungary. Many Nigerians had fled to neighbouring countries following Russia’s invasion of Ukraine which began on February 24. On Friday, the third batch arrived in Abuja since the federal government started the evacuation process. According to NiDCOM, the arrivals increased the number of Nigerians evacuated to 1,112 as 807 others had earlier been evacuated in three batches. NiDCOM also said the returnees were excited to be home after the uncertainty of fleeing from the war. “They applauded the speedy response of the federal government to their plight,” NiDCOM said. Buhari had approved the release of $8.5 million on Wednesday for the immediate evacuation of at least 5,000 Nigerians fleeing the Russian-Ukrainian conflict zone to Poland, Romania, Hungary, and Slovakia.
