Some Nigerian students in Sumy State University (SumDU), Ukraine, say they’ve been cooking with ice and snow due to water shortage in the city. According to The Nation, the Nigerians are part of the over 800 international students hiding in bunkers in hostels in SumDU(pictured). The students were quoted as saying their water and power supply were disrupted on March 3 when bombs destroyed a water plant and power substation serving the city. Russian troops invaded Ukraine on February 24, and since then, many residents of the country, including Nigerians, have fled to neighbouring countries. But the students are said to be unable to flee Sumy as all routes leading to the city have been blocked. Emmanuella Oiza, a 17-year-old first-year medical student, was quoted as saying: “People had to use snow to cook food because there was no water. “The bombings are audible from everywhere in the city. We hide in bunkers. We heard some sounds although it’s not near the hostel we’re in and due to the bomb the day before yesterday, our light and water were cut off. “We had to trek to another hostel which is closer to the city centre to get light because no light means no data connection. “In this hostel there’s light but no water and the population increased drastically today (Saturday) and yesterday (Friday). More than half of the population of hostels 4 and 5 are in this hostel which is hostel 3. “So it’s congested; no bed space, the toilets aren’t working so everywhere smells and it’s just tiring. It doesn’t help that it’s really cold and snowing at this point.” Oiza said many of the Nigerians are medical students while others are studying computer science, management and other courses.
