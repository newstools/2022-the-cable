Liverpool defeated Nottingham Forest 1-0 in the quarter-final of the English FA Cup at the City Ground on Sunday. The Anfield side left both Sadio Mane and Mohamed Salah on the bench but had enough to dominate the encounter, with Diogo Jota scoring the match winner with a routine strike. Jurgen Klopp’s side enjoyed 65 percent possession in the encounter but had to wait until the 78th minute before Jota buried Konstantinos Tsimikas’ cross from the left-wing. The victory keeps alive Liverpool’s quest for a quadruple of titles in the league, Champions League, and FA Cup to add to the Carabao Cup they already won in February. Liverpool have been drawn to face Manchester City, who brushed aside Southampton 4-1 in an earlier encounter. The second semi-final clash will be a London derby between Chelsea and Crystal Palace.
