Lagos yellow taxi drivers can now collect payment via a digital payment system. Univasa Nigeria Limited, an information technology company, disclosed this on Friday during a media briefing at the headquarters of the Lagos State Taxi Drivers and Cab Operators Association (LSTDCOA) in Oshodi, Lagos. The company said through “Verify and Pay”, passengers hailing yellow taxis can scan the barcode on the taxi to confirm the details of the driver and the vehicle, input their destination to check and negotiate fares, and select preferred payment options such as card payments or USSD. Speaking at the event, Ben Adeniyi, chief executive officer of Univasa, said the payment platform was developed to transform the transport system in Lagos state and Nigeria. “As a driver partner with Univasa, you get to enjoy the convenience of receiving your payments instantly with our instant withdrawal feature, so “Cash or Card e no matter” as we like to say and for the riders, we are offering you a chance to own your experience while hailing a ride,” he said. In his remarks, Omolekan Taiwo, president of LSTDCOA, urged the association’s members to embrace technology to drive revenue growth. He said the association regularly organises training to educate members, especially older persons on how to use digital apps. Commending Univasa for the initiative, Taiwo expressed optimism that it would help improve the reputation of the association as riders will be more assured of their safety. Univasa also rolled out its “Drive to Own” empowerment programme, which allows drivers on the Univasa ride-hailing app to pick a Univasa car as their vehicle of choice to work, make daily remittances for a duration of 18-24months, which will be deducted from their earnings from the app, and then the car becomes their own. In partnership with Lagos taxi drivers, Univasa had launched its ride-hailing application in December 2020 with a campaign called “Baba dey Online”.
