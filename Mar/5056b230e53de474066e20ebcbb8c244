The federal government says it has made arrangements to provide temporary accommodation for Nigerian students fleeing Ukraine who want to study in Romania. On February 24, troops invaded Ukraine after Vladimir Putin, president of Russia, ordered a special military operation in Donbas, a separatist-held region in Ukraine. Since the invasion, there have been reported casualties from both countries, leading many residents of Ukraine, including Nigerians who are mostly students, to flee to neighbouring countries. The federal government had subsequently begun the evacuation of citizens with hundreds of persons brought back to Nigeria over the past days. In a statement on Tuesday, the ministry of foreign affairs said the Nigerian embassy in Romania has made arrangements with some universities to provide the accommodation. It, however, said the accommodation would be given for one month. “The Embassy of the Federal Republic of Nigeria in Bucharest, Romania, wishes to notify Nigerian students fleeing the conflict in Ukraine that arrangements have been made with some universities to provide hostel accommodation for those who wish to explore options and opportunities of furthering their education in Romania (for a period of one month),” the statement reads. “Whoever wishes to benefit from this opportunity should send a message to either of the following numbers: +40 749 335 927 or +40 786 091 964.”
