One person was killed in an accident involving a truck and commercial motorcycle (okada) around the second Lekki tollgate, Lekki-Epe expressway, Lagos state, on Tuesday. The motorcyclist reportedly drove against traffic before he rammed into the moving truck, leading to his death, while a passenger sustained injury. The incident triggered a protest in the area, while a mob set the truck ablaze, causing commotion and gridlock in the axis. Speaking on the incident, Shola Jejeloye, chairman of the state taskforce, said the agency’s operatives in partnership with other security agencies have been able to quell the unrest. Jejeloye urged motorists to be more patient and considerate while driving on the roads to avoid accidents and unrest. “A second’s patience could go a long way in saving a life. We should not be too quick or hasty to drag right of way when driving because the person you are struggling with could probably not be in the right frame of mind at that moment. Let us be considerate when driving,” he said. “Efforts are currently being made to evacuate the burnt vehicle off the road and ease traffic flow along that axis.” He also warned “all the unscrupulous elements in our society who are perpetuators and feeding fat on crises to refrain from such or face the full wrath of the law”.
