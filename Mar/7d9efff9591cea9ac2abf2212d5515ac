The World Trade Organisation (WTO) has expressed concern over the ongoing conflict between Russia and Ukraine. In a statement on Wednesday, Ngozi Okonjo-Iweala, WTO director-general, called for a peaceful resolution of the situation. She said the WTO is “deeply saddened” about casualties that have been sustained in the war so far. She also said the conflict could disrupt trade with significant consequences for global food stability. “At the WTO, we have watched this tragedy in Ukraine unfold with disbelief and the hope that it would have been peacefully resolved,” the statement reads. “However, this is now the 7th day, and we are deeply saddened by the continued suffering and loss of life. We pray that there will be a peaceful and quick resolution. “We are also concerned about the trade implications of the conflict, especially trade in agriculture and food products and the rise in energy prices and their effects on the impacted population.” On Tuesday, the United Nations (UN) human rights office said that at least 136 civilians had been killed by Russia’s assault, including 13 children.
