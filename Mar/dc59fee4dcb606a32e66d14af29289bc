Roman Abramovich, Chelsea FC owner, reportedly suffered symptoms of suspected poisoning during peace talks between Russia and Ukraine. According to BBC, the incident took place earlier in March in Kyiv. Abramovich’s symptoms were said to have included sore eyes and skin peeling. A source was quoted as saying the Russian billionaire had recovered and was continuing with negotiations in an attempt to end the war in Ukraine. Two Ukrainian peace negotiators, including Rustem Umerov, the Ukrainian lawmaker, were also said to have been affected. Umerov had tweeted on Monday that he was fine and asked people not to trust unverified information. “I’m fine. This is my response to all the yellow news spreading around,” he wrote. “Please do not trust any unverified information. We have an informational war ongoing as well.” On Sunday, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky said Abramovich had offered to help with the peace talks. The Russian billionaire was said to have travelled between Moscow and Kyiv for several rounds of talks at the start of the month. Meanwhile, the Wall Street Journal reports that the alleged poisoning has been linked to people in Russia who wanted to sabotage the talks.
