Chelsea came from a goal down to claim a 2-1 win at Lille in their UEFA Champions League (UCL) clash at the Stade Pierre-Mauroy on Wednesday night. The Blues responded to going behind with goals from Christian Pulisic and Cesar Azpilicueta to record a 4-1 aggregate victory over the French champions. Burak Yilmaz scored a penalty to put Lille ahead following a handball from Jorginho but Pulisic restored parity on the stroke of halftime. Azpilicueta then put the tie to bed with a strike at the back post to claim the victory for Thomas Tuchel’s side who advanced to the last eight of the competition. They will be joined by Villarreal who handed Juventus a 3-0 defeat at the Allianz Stadium, thanks to three late goals from Gerard Moreno, Pau Torres, and Arnaud Danjuma. Moreno converted a 78th-minute penalty following Daniel Rugani’s foul on Francisco Coquelin before Torres converted following a corner kick. Danjuma then put the nail in Juve’s coffin with a second penalty in added time following a Matias de Ligt handball to complete a 4-1 aggregate victory. RESULTS
