The federal government has constituted a panel to investigate the vandalisation of facilities at the Moshood Abiola National Stadium in Abuja by fans following Super Eagles’ failure to qualify for Qatar 2022 World Cup. On Tuesday, some fans of the Super Eagles went on rampage and caused massive destruction to facilities at the stadium. According to Sunday Dare, minister of sports and youth development, the nine-member committee would be headed by Sanni Usman, a retired deputy inspector general (DIG) of police. The minister said Usman would be assisted by Henry Nzekwu as the committee’s vice chairman while Olumide Bamiduro of the sports ministry would be the secretary. Other members of the panel include Omatseye Nesiama, retired navy commodore; Abba Yola; Simon Ebhojiaye of the sports ministry; Tayo Oreweme; Mitchell Obi and a representative of the Department of State Services (DSS) director. The statement said the terms of reference for the investigative panel will be communicated to the members in due course. Dare had earlier condemned the vandalisation of the facilities at the stadium. The minister added that those found culpable would be brought to book. “Vandalizing and destroying sporting infrastructure at the Moshood Abiola National Stadium is not the acceptable manner to show unhappiness. The young Nigerians that did this must be condemned,” he had said.
