A video of a dispatch rider allegedly caught with a child inside a delivery box has surfaced online. In the undated video, which has gone viral, the suspect was said to have been caught in the Sangotedo area of Lagos. The infant was removed from the box, while an enraged crowd was seen assaulting the dispatch rider. Reacting to the development in a statement issued on Saturday, Adekunle Ajisebutu, police public relations officer (PPRO) in Lagos, said the incident has not been reported to any police station. He, however, said the command has launched an investigation to ascertain what exactly transpired. “The attention of the Lagos State Police Command has been drawn to a video going viral on social media alleging that a yet-to-be-identified dispatch rider stole a child found and recovered in a dispatch box,” the statement reads. “The command wishes to inform the public that the incident said to have taken place in the Sangotedo area, Lekki, was not reported at any police station to enable the police to take appropriate actions. “Notwithstanding that the incident was not reported, the Commissioner of Police, Abiodun Alabi, fdc, mnim, psc, has directed that efforts should be intensified to locate the whereabouts of the alleged dispatch rider and the parents or guardians of the child to enable the police to investigate the incident.”
