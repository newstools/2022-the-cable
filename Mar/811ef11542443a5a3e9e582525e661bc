Shooting Stars Sports Club (3SC) have sacked 17 players after a review of the team’s performances in the ongoing season of the Nigeria Professional Football League (NPFL). According to NAN, the club announced the mass retrenchment in a statement released by Tosin Omojola, its media officer, on Thursday. Since returning to the NPFL from relegation this season, 3SC’s performance has left much to be desired from fans of the five-time league champions. The team has failed to win in their last five games in the league. 3SC have also secured just 20 points in 17 matches, having grabbed five wins, five draws and seven losses. The Oluyole Warriors are just three points above the relegation zone, scoring 16 goals and conceding 18 more in return. According to the statement, the lackluster performance is the reason for the players’ dismissal. “The players were dropped after a review of the team’s performance in the ongoing 2021/2022 season,” the statement read. “The affected players were released after the club’s technical crew painstakingly reviewed their performances, which fell short of expectations.” It added that four of the players, namely Tambe Charles, Anas Mohammed, Abubakar Adeyemi and Anene Francis, have been with the team for more than two seasons while the remaining 13 players were among those recruited before the kick-off of the ongoing season. These players include Egorde Oghenetega, Ebenezer Odeyemi, Wasiu Alalade, Kola Daniel, Yusuf Habeeb, Olumide Henry and Kehinde Adedipe. The rest are Olasunkanmi Quadry, Amusan Taiye, Adelani Seun, Onwubuche Chimankpa, Wellington Ehiabhi and Meshack Amos. The Edith Agoye-led side is billed to host Kano Pillars at the Lekan Salami Stadium in Ibadan on Sunday.
