The trio of Kano Pillars, Heartland, and Katsina United have been relegated from the Nigeria Professional Football League (NPFL) as the 2021/22 season comes to an end. They join the Mountain of Fire Miracle Ministry (MFM) FC as the bottom four teams to descend into the Nigeria National League (NNL). The relegation of Pillars was confirmed on Saturday after the decision by the appeal committee of the Nigeria Football Federation (NFF) upholding the three-point deduction penalty for violence. The Sai Masu Gida boys had been penalised with point deduction by the NFF disciplinary committee after Suraj Yahaya, Kano Pillars chairman, had assaulted an assistant referee during his club’s game against Dakkada FC. #NPFL22 final standings#NPFL22FinalDay @SundayDareSD @bernard_parah pic.twitter.com/Mk7m4ARXih — League Management NG (@LMCNPFL) July 17, 2022  On Sunday, Katsina United slumped 3-0 to Wikki Tourists in Bauchi and failed to avoid the drop by goal difference while Shooting Stars finished adrift them with four goals.
