A surgical procedure carried out on Vice-President Yemi Osinbajo, on Saturday, was successful — according to his doctors. Earlier on Saturday, Laolu Akande, spokesman to the vice-president, had said the vice-president was scheduled for surgery over a “recurrent pain in his leg”. According to Akande, Osinbajo’s surgery took place at the Duchess International Hospital in Lagos. Also, a statement signed by Adedoyin Dosunmu-Ogunbi, medical director, Duchess International Hospital, indicated that the vice-president would be discharged within a few days. “The Vice President of the Federal Republic of Nigeria, His Excellency, Professor Yemi Osinbajo, SAN, GCON, was admitted to the Duchess International Hospital GRA, Ikeja, Lagos, today on account of a fracture of his right femur (thigh bone), possibly related to a longstanding injury associated with a game of squash,” the statement by Dosunmu-Ogunbi reads. “He had a surgical operation performed by a team of specialist doctors, including Dr. Wallace Ogufere (Consultant Orthopaedic Surgeon); Dr. Om Lahoti (Consultant Orthopaedic Surgeon); Dr. Babajide Lawson (Consultant Orthopaedic Surgeon); Dr. Ken Adegoke (Consultant in Anaesthesia & Critical Care); Dr. Oladimeji Agbabiaka (Consultant Anaesthetist); and Dr Adedoyin Dosunmu-Ogunbi (Consultant Physician & Medical Director). “The operation was successful, and he is expected to be discharged within the next few days.” Medical personnel involved in the surgery on Vice-President Yemi Osinbajo
