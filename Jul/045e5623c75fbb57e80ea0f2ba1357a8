Jude Ise-Idehen, a member of the house of representatives, is dead. The legislator, who represented Egor/Ikpoba Okha federal constituency of Edo state, reportedly died on Friday after a brief illness. He was a member of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP). Benjamin Kalu, spokesperson of the house, did not respond to calls to comment on the development. However, Godwin Obaseki, Edo governor, confirmed the development in a post on his social media handles. “I received the sad news of the passing of Hon. Jude Ise-Idehen with rude shock. It is indeed a painful and great loss for the people of Ikpoba-Okha/Egor Federal Constituency, the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) in the state, and the country at large,” Obaseki said. “A consummate politician, he was a community mobiliser; firm and considerate in the discharge of his duties. He was compassionate, kind and hardworking. “For the people of Ikpoba-Okha/Egor Constituency, he was a force to reckon with. He served diligently and promoted projects that enhanced the living standards of his people. He will be remembered for his selfless service and commitment to the development of his constituency. “I commiserate with the Ise-Idehen family, as well as friends of our great son, and pray that God will grant all the fortitude to bear the irreparable loss. Nse Ekpenyong died eight months after the passing of Adedayo Omolafe, a member who represented Akure north/south federal constituency. Omolafe was the fifth lawmaker to have died in the house of representatives in 2021 and the seventh in the ninth assembly. He died four months after the passing of Suleiman Aliyu, a member of the green chamber from Kaduna state. Meanwhile, Aliyu died four days after the demise of Haruna Maitala from Plateau state, who was involved in a car accident along the Abuja-Keffi road.
