The first batch of Team Nigeria athletes to the 2022 Commonwealth Games in Birmingham departed the country on Friday. A group left through the Murtala Mohammed International Airport in Lagos while the other group left through the Nnamdi Azikwe International Airport, Abuja. Sunday Dare, minister of sports; Habu Gumel, president of the Nigeria Olympic Committee (NOC); and Simon Ebhojiaye, the Chef de Mission to the Games, were at both airports to wish the athletes well. In his remark, Dare charged the athletes to be focused, disciplined and conscious of carrying the hopes and aspirations of over 200 million Nigerians. “If you have any complaints, the ministry has outlined how they can be resolved. There are just three layers for conflict resolution now and by the time you are getting to that third layer, then you are getting to me,” he said. The minister also reiterated the country’s zero tolerance policy against doping and the need for the athletes to be clean and fair. “Only last week, the Athletics Integrity Unit (AIU) commended us for our zero tolerance stance against doping and the seriousness we have attached to our anti-doping campaign,” he added. “Our increased number of testings and drive to do things right are some of the things you should reflect at this Games.” Ninety four athletes and twenty one officials will represent Nigeria in nine sports at the games scheduled to hold between July 28 to August 8 in the United Kingdom.
