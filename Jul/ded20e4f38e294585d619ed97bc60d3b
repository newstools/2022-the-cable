Ayodele Subair, executive chairman, Lagos State Internal Revenue Service (LIRS), says it is discontinuing all previously used bill references effective from August 1st, 2022. Monsurat Amasa, head of corporate communications at LIRS, said this in a statement issued over the weekend. Amasa quoted Subair as saying that only the Enterprise Tax Solutions (eTax) generated bill references will be accepted for tax payments, rendering other bill references invalid. The LIRS boss said the eTax was built as a one-stop-shop for all tax transactions. He said that by the cutoff date of August 1st, 2022, eTax would become the only authorised channel to generate bill references for tax payments and other tax-related transactions in Lagos state. “The eTax platform, (https://etax.lirs.net) which went live in October 2019, was launched by LIRS to engender seamless tax operations and reduce compliance costs to taxpayers,” the statement reads. “Since its launch, eTax has improved the effectiveness of tax administration in Lagos state. According to LIRS, “To generate a bill reference on e-Tax, taxpayers can use the 5 easy steps below: Visit https://etax.lirs.net; Input your Payer ID and password to log in; Select revenue type, and upload schedule (For PAYE & Withholding Taxes); Generate a bill reference; Make a payment on any of the multiple channels available, using the generated bill reference.” The agency said the move is aimed at optimising its payment procedures for utmost efficiency and taxpayers’ convenience.
