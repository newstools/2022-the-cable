The Niger police command says it has rescued five persons who were kidnapped by gunmen during an attack on Kuchi village in Munya LGA of the state. Wasiu Abiodun, police spokesperson in the state, disclosed the development in a statement on Friday. TheCable had earlier reported that gunmen attacked Kuchi village and abducted some residents. Yusuf Kokki, convener of Concerned Shiroro Youths, a non-governmental organisation (NGO) in the state, said the gunmen invaded the village around 2am on Friday, and abducted “about 50 people”. Kokki had also said the gunmen invaded the village while it was raining, adding that the attackers were trapped with the abducted persons at Dangunu river, owing to the overflow of water caused by the heavy rainfall. However, Abiodun said nine persons were abducted, adding that police operatives are on the trail of the gunmen to capture them and ensure the other abductees are rescued. “On 22/07/2022 at about 0520hrs, armed bandits/terrorists attacked Kuchi village via Sarkin-Pawa, Munya LGA and abducted nine persons,” the statement reads. “Meanwhile, police tactical teams with vigilante members were drafted to the area and five victims were rescued unhurt while the teams are still on the trail of the hoodlums for rescue of the remaining victims.”
