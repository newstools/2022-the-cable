Joe Biden, president of the United States of America, has tested positive for COVID. According to a statement by Karine Jean-Pierre, white house press secretary, Biden is experiencing “mild symptoms” and has begun taking Paxlovid, an anti-viral treatment. The US president is also expected to isolate at the white house, while continuing to carry out his duties. “This morning, President Biden tested positive for COVID-19. He is fully vaccinated and twice boosted and experiencing very mild symptoms,” the statement reads. “He has begun taking Paxlovid. Consistent with CDC guidelines, he will isolate at the White House and will continue to carry out all of his duties fully during that time. “He has been in contact with members of the White House staff by phone this morning, and will participate in his planned meetings at the White House this morning via phone and Zoom from the residence. “Consistent with White House protocol for positive COVID cases, which goes above and beyond CDC guidance, he will continue to work in isolation until he tests negative. Once he tests negative, he will return to in-person work.” Jean-Pierre also said daily updates on Biden would be provided, adding that the prior to the Thursday result, the US president had tested negative on Tuesday. “Out of an abundance of transparency, the White House will provide a daily update on the President’s status as he continues to carry out the full duties of the office while in isolation,” the statement reads. “Per standard protocol for any positive case at the White House, the White House Medical Unit will inform all close contacts of the President during the day today, including any Members of Congress and any members of the press who interacted with the President during yesterday’s travel. “The President’s last previous test for COVID was Tuesday, when he had a negative test result.” Meanwhile, the development comes 12 weeks after US Vice-President Kamala Harris tested positive for the virus.
