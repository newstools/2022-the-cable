President Muhammadu Buhari says the perpetrators of the attack in Shiroro LGA of Niger state will be found and made to face justice. The president described them as “sadists” and “parasites”, adding that the security agencies will be on their trail. Four Chinese and several Nigerian workers were on Wednesday abducted by gunmen at a mining site in Ajata Aboki village in Shiroro. Several soldiers mobilised to the area sustained injuries, while a number of them were killed in the attack. In a statement on Friday, the president maintained that Nigeria is winning the war against the Boko Haram insurgency. Buhari said the terrorists’ agenda is to sow fear and division among Nigerians. “We honour our security forces, and particularly those brave souls who have given their lives fighting against the evil that is terrorism. They constitute the best that Nigeria has to offer and we remember each of them,” he said. “Sadly, Nigeria’s fight against terrorism continues. It is a battle that is taking its toll on all of us. But we shall not relent, nor shall we surrender. “We say it again that we have reduced Boko Haram to a shell of its former self. But terrorists are parasites. They thrive when the world is suffering. “This atrocity only serves to further strengthen us against them. Nigeria is united in obliterating these demons. Each day we grow closer to that goal. When they lash out during times of global suffering it is the act of a cornered animal, an act of desperation. “As always, their goal is the same: to sow fear and division amongst us. We will not let them. “Instead let us pray for the families and loved ones of those who sacrificed their lives in the fight against evil, and let us pray for the safe and speedy return of those abducted. We will do everything possible to ensure their return.” The president added that “no matter what rock you crawl under, what hole you sink into, what lie you hide behind, we are coming and we will find you”.
