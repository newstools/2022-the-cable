Tokunbo Abiru, senator representing Lagos east, has called on residents of the state to “step-up civic advocacy” to ensure proper voter education. The lawmaker spoke in Epe on Thursday at the commissioning of the Oluwo fish market and a mini-stadium in the community. The project, which includes a “N62.5 million empowerment fund” for 1,250 traders, was facilitated through the office of the sustainable developmental goals (SDGs). Abiru spoke in light of the revelation by the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) that over one million permanent voter cards (PVCs) are yet to be collected in Lagos. <img class="alignnone wp-image-719242" src="https://f5p3e9e4.stackpathcdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/WhatsApp-Image-2022-07-01-at-5.34.15-PM.jpeg" alt="" width="550" height="367" srcset="https://f5p3e9e4.stackpathcdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/WhatsApp-Image-2022-07-01-at-5.34.15-PM.jpeg 1080w, https://f5p3e9e4.stackpathcdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/WhatsApp-Image-2022-07-01-at-5.34.15-PM-300x200.jpeg 300w, https://f5p3e9e4.stackpathcdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/WhatsApp-Image-2022-07-01-at-5.34.15-PM-1024x683.jpeg 1024w, https://f5p3e9e4.stackpathcdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/WhatsApp-Image-2022-07-01-at-5.34.15-PM-768x512.jpeg 768w, https://f5p3e9e4.stackpathcdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/WhatsApp-Image-2022-07-01-at-5.34.15-PM-24x16.jpeg 24w, https://f5p3e9e4.stackpathcdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/WhatsApp-Image-2022-07-01-at-5.34.15-PM-36x24.jpeg 36w, https://f5p3e9e4.stackpathcdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/WhatsApp-Image-2022-07-01-at-5.34.15-PM-48x32.jpeg 48w" sizes="(max-width: 550px) 100vw, 550px" /> The commission also added that only 6,382 out of 34,242 PVCs were picked up after the continuous voter registration (CVR) in the first and second quarters of 2022. Reacting to this, Abiru urged Lagosians that “galvanising and educating voters is the best support” that can be given to the ambition of Bola Tinubu, former governor of the state and the presidential candidate of the All Progressives Congress (APC) for the 2023 elections. “As we journey into the year 2023, I urge us all to not only get registered but also step-up civic advocacy for our people to register with the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC),” the lawmaker said. “We need to also educate those who have earlier registered to check the validity of their PVCs. This is crucial for all of us and our great party, APC, especially now that our revered leader, Asiwaju Bola Tinubu is the presidential flag bearer of the APC. <img class="alignnone wp-image-719244" src="https://f5p3e9e4.stackpathcdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/WhatsApp-Image-2022-07-01-at-5.34.16-PM1.jpeg" alt="" width="550" height="366" srcset="https://f5p3e9e4.stackpathcdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/WhatsApp-Image-2022-07-01-at-5.34.16-PM1.jpeg 1280w, https://f5p3e9e4.stackpathcdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/WhatsApp-Image-2022-07-01-at-5.34.16-PM1-300x200.jpeg 300w, https://f5p3e9e4.stackpathcdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/WhatsApp-Image-2022-07-01-at-5.34.16-PM1-1024x682.jpeg 1024w, https://f5p3e9e4.stackpathcdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/WhatsApp-Image-2022-07-01-at-5.34.16-PM1-768x511.jpeg 768w, https://f5p3e9e4.stackpathcdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/WhatsApp-Image-2022-07-01-at-5.34.16-PM1-24x16.jpeg 24w, https://f5p3e9e4.stackpathcdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/WhatsApp-Image-2022-07-01-at-5.34.16-PM1-36x24.jpeg 36w, https://f5p3e9e4.stackpathcdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/WhatsApp-Image-2022-07-01-at-5.34.16-PM1-48x32.jpeg 48w" sizes="(max-width: 550px) 100vw, 550px" /> “Like Asiwaju said when he met with HRM (Oba) Rilwan Akiolu, the Oba of Lagos and his chiefs at the palace, the major task ahead is getting people to register for PVCs and ensure they vote for the APC at the general elections. “Therefore, galvanising and educating voters is the best support we can give for the aspiration to come into fulfilment.”
