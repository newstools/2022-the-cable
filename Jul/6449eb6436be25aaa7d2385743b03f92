Gunmen have killed the two sons of Daniel Umaru, a pastor of the Ekklesiyar Yan’uwa Njairi Nigeria (EYN), also known as the Church of the Brethren, in Mubi LGA of Adamawa state. The gunmen also shot the pastor and abducted his 13-year-old daughter. The pastor is said to be recuperating at the hospital. Humwashi Wonosikou, press secretary to Ahmadu Fintiri, the Adamawa governor, confirmed the incident in a statement on Thursday. In a condolence message, Fintiri described the attack as “shocking and barbaric”. “The state government condemned in the strongest terms the despicable attack on this innocent family,” the statement reads. “The perpetrators of this heinous act must be brought to justice. And we have offered our full support to the security agencies to do so.” The governor added that his government remains committed to confronting crime in all its forms, including the threat posed by kidnappers. While condoling the victims’ families and loved ones, and the church, Fintiri directed security agencies to scale up intelligence and fish out the criminals. The development comes amid reports of attacks on communities across the country in recent months, leading to killings, abductions, and destruction of property.
