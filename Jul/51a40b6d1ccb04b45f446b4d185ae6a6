The Nigerian army says its troops have killed ten Boko Haram members in an ambush between Magumeri and Gubio road in Borno state. The insurgents, who were said to be on motorcycles, reportedly mounted a checkpoint and abducted the passengers of two vehicles around Titiya village on Tuesday. The troops, who received a distress call, engaged the insurgents in a gun duel, killing ten of them while some others escaped with bullet wounds. The abducted passengers were also rescued while the two stolen vehicles were handed back to the owners. In June, troops of Operation Hadin Kai and the civilian joint task force killed 47 insurgents in the state. The combined troops, supported by the 21 army armoured brigade, Bama, invaded the camps of the insurgents in Gazuwa village in Bama LGA. The camps housed Boko Haram fighters and their families from the Abubakar Shekau faction.
