Kashim Shettima, former governor of Borno state, has been selected as the running mate of Bola Tinubu, presidential candidate of the All Progressives Congress (APC), for the 2023 election. Tinubu made the disclosure on Sunday while addressing journalists after meeting with President Muhammadu Buhari in Daura, Katsina state. Shettima is a serving senator and a former two-term governor of Borno state. Bayo Onanuga, director of media, Tinubu Campaign Organisation, also announced Shettima’s selection in a statement. “All Progressives Congress Presidential Candidate and National Leader, Asiwaju Bola Ahmed Tinubu on Sunday confirmed Senator Kashim Shettima as his Vice Presidential candidate,” the statement reads. “Senator Shettima is former Governor of Borno State and a close associate of Tinubu who has been a staunch supporter and campaigner for the choice of Tinubu as the next President of Nigeria. “He toured many states with Tinubu since December 2021 where he addressed party delegates and mobilised support for the former Governor of Lagos State.” The announcement comes shortly after Ibrahim Masari stepped down as the “placeholder” running mate of Tinubu. Masari was in June selected as Tinubu’s running mate — but only in a temporary capacity. In the statement announcing his withdrawal, Masari said it was an “honour and privilege” to be nominated. “But, after much reflection and wider consultations, I now wish to step down,” he said, adding that: “I realized that my decision will enable Asiwaju have more latitude to give more accommodation and inclusion that will position our party to win the coming elections, with the support of the people of Nigeria.”
