Arsenal have completed the signing of Gabriel Jesus, the Brazillian striker, on a long-term contract from Manchester City. The north London club announced Jesus’ signing in a statement on its website on Monday. The Brazillian joined Arsenal for a fee of around £45 million. He has also been assigned the number nine jersey vacated by Alexandre Lacazette, who recently left for Lyon. “Gabriel Jesus has signed from Manchester City on a long-term contract,” the statement read. “The 25-year-old forward joins us having established himself as one of the leading strikers in the Premier League in recent seasons. He scored 95 goals in 236 appearances in all competitions during his five seasons in Manchester. “Gabriel has won the Premier League title four times, the FA Cup, and the League Cup three times. He is a regular in the Brazil national team, making 56 appearances and scoring 19 times since making his full international debut for his country in September 2016. He was a member of the squad which won the Copa America in 2019. During his international career, Gabriel has also notably won a gold medal at the 2016 Rio Olympic Games, and featured at the 2018 FIFA World Cup. “Gabriel developed through the youth setup at Palmeiras, signing a youth contract in 2013, with his prolific goalscoring ensuring he quickly progressed into the first-team squad, making his debut as a 17-year-old in March 2015. During his time with Palmeiras, Gabriel was an integral part of the club’s Campeonato Brasileiro Serie A winning side in 2016, when he was voted as the league’s Bola de Ouro – Player of the Season.”
