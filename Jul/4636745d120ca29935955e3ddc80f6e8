Gudaji Kazaure, member of the house of representatives from Jigawa state, says he has defected from the All Progresssives Congress (APC) to the African Democratic Congress (ADC) but he is still loyal to President Muhammadu Buhari. In a statement on Tuesday, Kazaure said Abubakar Badaru, governor of Jigawa, denied him a return ticket “for no reason”. During the primary election, the lawmaker lost the APC ticket to Mukhtar Zanna, local government chairman of Kazaure. Zanna clinched the APC ticket after securing 89 votes. Muhammad Zakari, another house of representatives hopeful got 70 votes, while Kazaure came a distant third by polling 26 votes. The lawmaker, who represents Kazaure, Roni, Gwiwa and Yankwashi federal constituency in the lower legislative chamber, said he is confident of victory on the platform of ADC. “Yes I have left the APC, but my loyalty to my leader, President Muhammudu Buhari and the Nigerian masses still remains as strong as ever,” he said. “My governor denied me a return ticket to the house for no reason but it doesn’t change anything, I have moved to the ADC and my victory is assured by my people.” The lawmaker, who was first elected in 2015, is a known supporter of the president.
