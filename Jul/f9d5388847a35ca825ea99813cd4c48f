Some Nigerians have taken to social media to react to a video released by the Islamic State in West Africa Province (ISWAP) where the insurgents were seen flogging abducted passengers of Kaduna-Abuja train. In the video which surfaced on Sunday morning, the insurgents could be seen flogging the captives in their camp. In March 28, 2022, gunmen had attacked a Kaduna-bound train, killing eight people, injured many, and kidnapped over 60 persons. Eleven of 61 remaining victims were released “following negotiations” in June. The insurgents also threatened to abduct President Muhammadu Buhari and Nasir el-Rufai, governor of Kaduna state, in the video. A family member of one of the victims took to Twitter to air his grievances and disappointment with the government for not securing their release. “I’m really disappointed with you @MBuhari! My brother went for his NYSC Documentation, thinking he will serve his Father land, while on his way back using Abuja-Kaduna train he’s kidnapped and they’re tortured everyday. You have nothing to tell Nigerians! You have failed us!!” Abdulmalik tweeted. I’m really disappointed with you @MBuhari ! My brother went for his NYSC Documentation, thinking he will serve his Father land, while on his way back using Abuja-Kaduna train he’s kidnapped and they’re tortured everyday.

This shouldn't be happening ,it's over 100 days,&you are yet to find a means to get them out, yet your security chiefs move around like the country is safe. — Hon.Ab Faj (FlyingAeroBoy) (@AbeebFajobi) July 24, 2022  Apc is a curse from top to bottom.

It's such a worrying time to be a Nigerian.As they say, "hope springs eternal" — Chibuike (@chibuikecharl18) July 24, 2022  Before the end of the Jonathan regime the chibok girls were abducted now buhari’s regime is going to an end and the Abuja-Kaduna train passengers are still in captive.Are this moves done as a negotiating schedule for the next government??? — OLUWABIGI (@samuelhomeboy) July 24, 2022  It's so sad to allow the Abuja-Kaduna train victims with the Bandits up to this moment, Nigeria Govt.should please do all it can for the victims to reunite with their family. There's no reason for the https://t.co/QERdEFoRMm allow it patriotic citizens in this terrible situation? — Hassan A Isa (@HassanAIsa6) July 24, 2022  If the Government can't do much and secure the release of the victims of the  Abuja-Kaduna train within the shortest period. My single vote, my one vote will go to either Atiku, Kwankwaso or Peter Obi. I am a staunch supporter of the APC, and I am ready to use my PVC elsewhere — Idris Abdul Ahmed (@Nrs_Idreeserh) July 24, 2022  I just watched the video of the  victims of the Abuja-Kaduna train attacked being flogged. I am just speechless, and teary. Federal Government should give them what they want, give them the fucking money and their arrested families. They sit by, and looked away… — Idris Abdul Ahmed (@Nrs_Idreeserh) July 24, 2022  The video footage of the abducted Abuja-Kaduna train passengers is not only pathetically worrisome state of affairs, but a clear sign of a failed system. The Government must do something entirely different about our security. — Khalid Abu Khaleed™® (@AngaleKhalid) July 24, 2022  Torturing of Abuja-kaduna train kidnapped victims is worrisome. This shows that national security architectures are inactive; they must wake up to secure live and properties. — Alh. Bukar (@Abu_Bakr_kingx) July 24, 2022  It is so sad and disheartening watching the video of the Abuja-Kaduna kidnapped victims, to the victims and family Nigeria, has failed you and the government has failed you. May Allah rescue the kidnapped victims and bring end to this killings. — Bello Shehu Tijjani (@BelloShehuT) July 24, 2022  After watching this Abuja-Kaduna video, some of you will still come out to support Buhari's administration and APC.

Here they are being flogged mercilessly by the terrorists..this what Buhari and APC ll leave as legacy, may Allah come to their aide ASAP pic.twitter.com/Y79sI0EljS — BOSS  (@Najeebweeder) July 24, 2022  Those incharge of protecting Abuja-Kaduna train passengers will be saying they didn't sleep after watching that traumatizing video which is a lie. They sleep well knowing fully it's not their family members that's in that situation. — Dambatta (@M_Dambatta) July 24, 2022  Watching how the Abuja-Kaduna train victims were being tortured by the terrorists is very sad & knowing that what's holding them back is ransom is even more devastating bcus the Govt will never rescue them Only a fuuuu will go all out to campaign for this Govt. A fuuu — A.F Adewale (@Akewusolaf) July 24, 2022  Ya Allah make way for the Abuja-kaduna train attacked victims to be releasedThese is really, really sad — mss Mermerh (@MaryamTijjni) July 24, 2022
