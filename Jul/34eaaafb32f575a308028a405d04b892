Boris Johnson, UK prime minister, has been hit by three fresh ministerial resignations from his cabinet. Will Quince, minister for children and families; Robin Walker, minister of state for school standards, and John Glen, treasury minister, resigned their positions on Wednesday morning. While Quince said he had “no choice but to tender my resignation”, Walker said he no longer has faith in Johnson’s leadership. “Recent events have made it clear to me that our great party, for which I have campaigned all of my adult life, has become distracted from its core missions by a relentless focus on questions over leadership,” he said. “The loss of the Rishi Sunak and the Sajid Javid this week, two of our brightest talents from the top team, reflects a worrying narrowing of the broad church that I believe any conservative government should seek to achieve.” While announcing his resignation, Glen said he has a “complete lack of confidence” in Johnson’s leadership. Laura Trott, parliamentary private secretary in the department for transport, has followed suit over a loss of “trust” in the government. With deep regret I am resigning from the government. I will not be doing media interviews regarding this. pic.twitter.com/IT0C50g8My — John Glen MP (@JohnGlenUK) July 6, 2022   Less than 24 hours ago, Sajid Javid, UK secretary of state for health and social care, and Rishi Sunak, UK treasury chief, resigned from the cabinet. Their resignations are coming after the UK prime minister apologised over his handling of the concerns raised over Chris Pincher, deputy chief whip, following allegations of sexual misconduct. Pincher resigned as deputy chief whip last week following claims that he groped two men at a private members’ club.
