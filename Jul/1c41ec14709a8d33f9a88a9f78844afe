Thirteen residents of Kunkuna village in Safana LGA of Katsina state have been reportedly injured following an air strike conducted by the Nigerian Air Force (NAF). Abduljalal Haruna, a lawmaker in the Katsina state house of assembly, who confirmed the development on Thursday evening, said the incident occurred shortly after the attack on President Muhammadu Buhari’s security team in the state. Haruna said 13 people were injured and are currently receiving medical attention at the Katsina Teaching Hospital and Dutsinma General Hospital. According to him, gunmen invaded the community on the same day, and killed 12 residents, while several others sustained injuries. The lawmaker added that as a result of the development, Kunkuna and several other villages have been deserted as residents had fled over fears of another attack. “No communication has been made between the air force and my people over the bombing error,” he said. Efforts to reach Edward Gabkwet, NAF spokesman, were unsuccessful as he didn’t respond to calls or text messages. Meanwhile, the development comes weeks after a NAF fighter jet targeting insurgents reportedly killed six children in Kurebe area of Shiroro LGA in Niger state. The incident was said to have occurred on April 13, when the children were returning home from where they had gone to fetch water.
