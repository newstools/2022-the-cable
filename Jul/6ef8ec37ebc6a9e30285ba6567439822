Please this is not a campaign.” They said a journalist must be non-partisan (unbiased and fair).

He said Baba-Ahmed is “eminently qualified” to be Nigeria’s vice-president if the party wins the presidential election next year. Baba-Ahmed said he decided to accept the offer to become Obi’s running mate owing of his commitment to rescuing Nigeria.
