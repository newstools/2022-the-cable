Ikechi Emenike, governorship candidate of the All Progressives Congress (APC) in Abia, says his candidature is not in dispute. On May 26, the APC declared Emenike winner of the governorship primary election. Shortly after, ruling in a suit instituted by Chinedum Nwole and two others, a high court in Abia state declared that Emenike lacks the locus standi to contest the election because he had earlier been suspended from the party. However, in another ruling, O.A. Chijioke, the judge, granted Emenike a stay of execution on the restraining order earlier imposed. In June, two factions of the Abia state APC settled their disputes and affirmed their support for Emenike. Speaking at the weekend, Emenike said any other person laying claim to the governorship ticket is hallucinating. “Their fabricated result is not anywhere near our national secretariat. Somebody collecting money from them wanted to smuggle it in but was resisted,” he said. “If anybody is claiming to be a candidate, ask him: why is he going to court? You don’t need to go to court if you are sure you are the authentic candidate. “Ask the person to show his INEC acknowledgement letter. We have gone past the primaries. We are now faced with election.” The governorship candidate also expressed hope that the APC would have a landslide victory in the state and across the nation. “Anybody saying that APC will not win 2023 is asleep. APC will win by landslide both in Abia and Abuja. Don’t be deceived by social media. When the battle starts they will know we are prepared,” he said. In her remarks, Nkeiruka Onyejeocha, lawmaker representing Isuikwuato-Umunneochi federal constituency, said God told her that Emenike would be Abia’s next governor. “I don’t believe what I see, I believe what God has said. God has said that chief Ikechi Emenike will be the next Abia governor. Don’t doubt so that you see it because if you doubt you may not be alive to see it,” she said.
