Ado Aleru, a suspected bandit recently turbaned as Sarkin Fulani in Zamfara, says he did not ask for the title. Aleru said this in an interview published by DW Hausa on Sunday. On July 16, Aleru was turbaned as the Sarkin Fulani by Aliyu Marafa, Emir of Yandoto, in Tsafe LGA of the state. The police had, however, said the suspect was on its wanted list over his alleged involvement in banditry. The chieftaincy title has sparked sharp criticism, and Bello Matawalle, governor of Zamfara, has suspended the emir for awarding the title to Aleru. Matawalle has also banned traditional rulers in the state from awarding chieftaincy titles without getting government approval. Speaking on the reactions to his receiving the title, Aleru said it was the emirate that came to him. “This title, let me tell you the truth, I didn’t ask for it; they reached out to me regarding it,” Aleiro said. “They called and informed me of what they wanted to give me. Then, I said ‘no, this shouldn’t happen’. But since I have parents, later we sat down and discussed about it, and since the new king has said what he wants to do in his kingdom, I accepted the title.” He also denied taking part in an attack linked to him, which occurred on Kadisau village in Faskari LGA of Katsina in June and over 30 people were killed. “The talks about Kadisau, please, I beg you in the name of God to ask the Emir of Kadisau or look for his number and ask him the cause of the attack,” he said. “Our relatives were slaughtered inside a mosque on a Friday in Kadisau. That was what caused the attack, and their family members took their revenge. I didn’t know of it; I was just linked to it.”
