The Lagos State Residents Registration Agency (LASRRA) says it will soon launch an “upgraded” Lagos state resident identity card (LAG ID Card). The LASRRA had launched a smart multi-purpose identity card for residents in February. Ibilola Kasunmu, general manager of LASRRA, in a statement on Tuesday, said the new ID card will be launched on July 20 by Babajide Sanwo-Olu, governor of Lagos, at Police College, Ikeja GRA. She also said the launch will take place simultaneously across the five divisions of the state — Ikeja, Badagry, Ikorodu, Lagos Island, and Epe. “The new LAG ID Card is a multi-application smartcard that offers registered residents access to services ranging from ‘a means of personal security and identity verification’ at points of accessing various government services, to applying for loans from Lagos State Employment Trust Fund (LSETF),” the statement reads. The general manager said the new card is embedded with more features, adding that card holders can also use it to pay for services across multiple vendors, including buses, supermarkets and automated teller machines (ATMs). She said other advantages of the upgraded card include easy access to educational services for students at all levels, and quicker access to healthcare services at state-owned facilities. Kasunmu asked residents who have not registered to do so free of charge by visiting the website www.lagosresidents.gov.ng. She said once registration is activated online, residents would need to visit any LASRRA registration centre nearest to them so their biometrics can be captured to complete the process.
