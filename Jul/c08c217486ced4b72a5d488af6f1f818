Abdul-Ganiyu Salawudeen, the Aseyin of Iseyin in Oyo state, is dead. The aseyin’s death comes after the demise of four other traditional rulers in Oyo state within the past eight months. A palace source, who didn’t want to be named, said Salawudeen died at the University College Hospital (UCH), Ibadan, where he had been receiving treatment for an undisclosed ailment. “The king has joined his ancestors. He died today at the UCH,” the source said. “He had been taking treatment at the hospital for some time and we were hopeful that he would respond to treatment and return home. “Unfortunately, we lost him. He died at the age of 62.” Before the death of the aseyin, Jimoh Oyewumi, the Soun of Ogbomoso, died on December 12, 2021 at the age of 95; the soun’s death was followed by that of Abdul-Azeez Adewuyi, the Asigangan of Iganganland in Ibarapa area of the state. In January 2022, Saliu Adetunji, the Olubadan of Ibadanland, died, while on April 23, the demise of Lamidi Adeyemi, the Alaafin of Oyo, was announced. The Alaafin of Oyo spent 52 years on the throne before his death at the aged of 83. The late aseyin, who ascended the throne in 2006, was the 28th Aseyin of Iseyin. He studied veterinary medicine at the University of Ibadan, and graduated in 1991.
