Sam Ayedogbon, senior apostolic leader at Realm of Glory International Churches, has called on Christians to make the All Progressives Congress (APC) “pay heavily” for fielding two Muslims on its presidential ticket for the 2023 elections. On Sunday, Bola Tinubu, presidential candidate of APC, unveiled Kashim Shettima, former Borno governor, as his running mate. The announcement has garnered mixed reactions from different groups across the country. The loudest has been the condemnation by the Christian Association of Nigeria (CAN), with the body saying the ruling party “has no regard for our diversity” as a country. Some prominent APC members have also resigned from the party in protest of the decision. Adding his voice to the pushback, Ayedogbon, in a chat with Arise TV on Tuesday, said Christians must make APC know “they have made a terrible mistake”. “This is the time for Christians to deploy our votes and let them know that they have made a terrible mistake,” he said. “We should make them pay heavily. Let us use our votes to show them the value of our community as Christians because even when you capture slaves and you’re torturing them and put them in chains and put your leg on their neck and tell them not to cry. “So I’m advising Christians not to waste their votes but to use it strategically. “Also, it is not a matter of ethnicity. My issue with my friends on the ‘Obidient'(Peter Obi supporters) side is that I don’t want you to make me feel the reason you are supporting someone is because of their ethnic background. I don’t play ethnic religion. “The truth of the matter is they (APC) are making a terrible mistake and we are determined, even if they win, we will keep putting fire under them. “If any Christian leader starts supporting a Muslim-Muslim ticket, we will suspect you have been bought.”
