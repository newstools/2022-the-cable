Nyesom Wike, governor of Rivers, has rewarded each member of the Rivers United FC with $20,000 for winning the 2021/22 Nigeria Professional Football League (NPFL). The reward was announced in a post on the club’s official Facebook page on Thursday. This was after the team was hosted in a grand reception at the state government house in celebration of the league triumph. Alongside the cash gift, the team was also promised a two-week pre-season training in Madrid, in preparation for next season’s CAF Champions League campaign. Wike also conferred the “governors merit service award (GMSA)” on every member of the squad. “Rivers state governor Nyesom Wike rewards members of Rivers United FC with $20,000 each for winning the NPFL22 season,” the post read. “He says the team will stay two weeks in Madrid to prepare for next season’s CAF Champions League “He also conferred on each member of the team the governors merit service award (GMSA)” In June, Rivers United won their first-ever NPFL title with four games to spare.
