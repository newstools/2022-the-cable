Gunmen, on Tuesday, opened fire on the security team of President Muhammadu Buhari in Katsina state. The president is scheduled to visit Katsina during the sallah celebration which will hold over the weekend. Garba Shehu, presidential spokesman, who confirmed the attack in a statement on Tuesday, said two persons sustained injuries. He added that the security team was on its way to Daura to prepare for the president’s visit when it was attacked. “The Presidency has described as sad and unwelcome, the shooting incident near Dutsinma, Katsina State, at the convoy of cars carrying the Advance Team of security guards, protocol and media officers ahead of the President, Muhammadu Buhari’s trip to Daura for Sallah,” the statement reads. “The attackers opened fire on the convoy from ambush positions but were repelled by the military, police and DSS personnel accompanying the convoy. “Two persons in the convoy are receiving treatment for the minor injuries they suffered. All the other personnel, staff and vehicles made it safely to Daura.” The development comes amid attacks by gunmen on communities across the country, leading to killings, abductions and destruction of property in recent years. However, in April 2022, Lai Mohammed, minister of information, had dismissed the concern raised by former President Olusegun Obasanjo that the Buhari administration is “overwhelmed” by insecurity. “Our military is doing its best. The government is by no means overwhelmed even if it appears to some that it is overwhelmed,” Mohammed had said. Editor’s note: The featured image was used for illustrative purposes.
