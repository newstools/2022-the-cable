President Muhammadu Buhari says his children know that he is not leaving material possessions for anyone to inherit. Garba Shehu, presidential spokesman, in a statement, said Buhari spoke on Wednesday during a visit to the palace of Umar Faruk, Emir of Daura, in Katsina state. The president was quoted as saying more time should be given to coach future leaders with basic knowledge of moral values, as the fast-changing world driven by new technology, would be more competitive and demanding. “I was locked up for more than three years, after leading the country. At that point, I realised and I told my children that your net worth is what is in your head, not what you have acquired in life,” Buhari was quoted as saying. “My focus has always been on training the children to be relevant wherever they find themselves. I told my children, particularly the girls, that they can only get married after getting a first degree. “They already know I am not leaving anything for anyone to inherit. My greatest legacy to the children is to ensure they are properly educated.” The president also said youths should be guided and taught history, as they would find it hard to be patriotic, responsible and respectful without a thorough understanding of their background. “Whoever does not have a good sense of history will easily make mistakes,” he said. “We should ensure the children get a proper education. The knowledge they acquire should not be towards getting government jobs. “We don’t have jobs in government anymore. With technology, governments are becoming smaller, nimble and efficient. “Emphasis should now be on skills acquisition and competence in creation and deployment of technology.” The president told the emir that he would be more regular in visits as he prepares to leave office in May 2023, adding that the prolonged absence was due to the demands of his office.
