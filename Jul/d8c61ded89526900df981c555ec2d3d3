Yekini Nabena, former deputy spokesman of the All Progressives Congress (APC), says the decision of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) to abandon zoning is dangerous. Bola Tinubu, standard bearer of the ruling party, picked Kashim Shettima, former governor of Borno, as his running mate. Speaking with journalists on Tuesday in Abuja, Nabena said those that have argued that the Muslim-Muslim ticket is not fair have not considered traditional worshippers in the country. The former spokesman said Nigerians should be worried more about the zoning arrangement that the PDP “killed” for Atiku Abubakar, its presidential candidate. “None of those agitating against the Muslim-Muslim ticket on the basis of fairness have considered the African traditional worshippers,” he said. “How fair is it that we are agitating for fairness and equity to share power between Christians and Muslims while completely ignoring and alienating our African traditional worshippers, where is the justice? “Nigeria should worry more about the zoning arrangement which the PDP has just killed for their selfish interest and desperation of its presidential candidate, Alhaji Atiku Abubakar, because for Atiku it is the last chance which will become one-chance for him by 2023.” “The APC has done the right thing by zoning the presidency to the south. Nigerians must know that religion is a matter of individual race, the most important thing is that the presidency is in the south compared to PDP’s unfair treatment to the south. “PDP zoned presidency to the north while the incumbent president is from the north, a Muslim and Fulani man, just like Atiku. “This is actually calls for anger and not harmless Muslim-Muslim ticket of the APC.”
