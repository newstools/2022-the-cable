A plane belonging to Dana Air has made an emergency landing at the Nnamdi Azikwe international airport, Abuja. According to a statement by Dana Air management, the incident happened on Tuesday at about 2:52pm. The affected aircraft was identified as the Boeing 737 aircraft with registration number — 5N DNA. In the statement, the management said 100 passengers on the Abuja-bound aircraft were “disembarked safely”. “Our Abuja-bound Boeing 737 aircraft with registration number (5N DNA) embarked on an emergency landing today 19th July, 2022, due to an indication on one of its engines,” the statement reads. “The pilot in command briefed the passengers on the incident and landed the aircraft safely at the Abuja International airport at about 2.52pm. “All 100 passengers disembarked safely and the aircraft has been grounded for immediate attention by our team of engineers. “The Nigerian Civil Aviation Authority (NCAA) have also been briefed on the incident. “We sincerely apologise to all our passengers on board the flight and reassure our customers that Dana Air will continue to maintain its high safety standards.” The development comes weeks after Dana Air made the headlines over an issue relating to its aircraft. In May, over 50 passengers were rescued when fire gutted the tyres of an aircraft operated by Dana Air in Port Harcourt. The plane was scheduled to take off from Port Harcourt to Lagos state. Meanwhile, in February 2018, there were reports that the door of an aircraft operated by Dana Air fell off during taxing in the Abuja airport — a development that caused apprehension among passengers in the aircraft.
