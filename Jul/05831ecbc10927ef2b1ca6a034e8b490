Ademola Adeleke, governorship candidate of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) in Osun election, has lauded the voting process in the state. Speaking with journalists on Saturday after voting at his polling unit in Ede north LGA of the state, Adeleke said he will be on the ground to monitor the election as it progresses. “I’m impressed with the electoral process at the moment; everything is going on smoothly,” the former senator said. “I will be on the ground to monitor things.” Adeleke is contesting the governorship position with Gboyega Oyetola, governor of Osun and candidate of the All Progressives Congress (APC), and Yusuff Lasun, former deputy speaker of the house of representatives and Labour Party (LP) candidate. In 2018, Oyetola, who is seeking another term in office, defeated Adeleke in a keenly contested election. That election was characterised by violence. Adeleke had scored the highest number of votes in the election, but the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) held a rerun and Oyetola was eventually declared winner.
