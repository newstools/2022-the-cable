The Nigeria Immigration Service (NIS), in Oyo state says its officials have rescued a victim of trafficking, who is three months pregnant. Olufemi Adetunji, NIS public relations officer, announced the development at a media briefing on Friday. Adetunji said the victim has been handed over to the National Agency for the Prohibition of Trafficking in Persons (NAPTIP). He said the 20-year-old victim, who was rescued from Saki area of the state, was brought from Akwa Ibom to Oyo on June 19 by the suspect with a promise to get her a good job. Adetunji said the suspect was aware of the victim’s pregnancy before engaging her as a sex worker. “Instead of getting her the promised job, she engaged her into prostitution and collected the money from men who slept with the victim,” the NIS spokesman said. “Our men also apprehended the suspect and have handed her over to NAPTIP for further investigation and prosecution.” The PRO said that agency would not relent in its efforts on enlightening the public on the dangers of human trafficking. He also called on parents to always find out what their children are doing while under a helper, adding that human traffickers promise their victims juicy offers, but end up engaging them in something else. In an interview, the suspect said the victim was with a friend and that she was not the one who collected the money. “She was aware that she would be engaged as a sex worker because the victim informed me that she was looking for money to buy baby wears,” the suspect added. Meanwhile, Akanya Augustine, coordinator of NAPTIP in Oyo state, said the case would be investigated, while the victim will be rehabilitated. He commended NIS for the collaboration with the agency towards eradicating human trafficking in the state.
