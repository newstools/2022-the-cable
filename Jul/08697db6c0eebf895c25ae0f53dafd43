Some residents have been reportedly abducted after gunmen invaded Kampani Waya, a village in Kontagora LGA of Niger state. A source, who didn’t want to be named, told TheCable that the gunmen kidnapped many residents during the attack. “The information reaching us is that they attacked Kambani Waya and kidnapped several residents,” the source said. “We are yet to confirm the actual number of persons that were kidnapped, but they also stole some cattle and passed through Baban Dogo village with them.” Yahaya Abdullahi, zone C chairman of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) in Niger state, also spoke on the attack. Zone C in Niger state includes communities in Kontagora LGA. According to Abdullahi, the gunmen were seen on several motorcycles around Kambani Waya village at about 11am on Thursday. “The attack is true. They were seen on many motorcycles passing from Kambani Waya to Baban Dogo village near Kontagora,” Abdullahi said. “They usually take that route to take away their stolen cattle, because the road links Niger to Zamfara state.” When contacted, Wasiu Abiodun, police spokesperson in Niger, promised to respond with information on the development. Emmanuel Umar, commissioner for internal security and humanitarian affairs in the state, also said he would respond when he gets more information. However, no response had been received from Abiodun or Umar at the time of this report.
