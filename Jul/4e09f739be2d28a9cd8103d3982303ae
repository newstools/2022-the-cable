Novak Djokovic defeated Nick Kyrgios to secure his 21st Grand Slam crown in Sunday’s Wimbledon men’s singles final. The victory earned the 35-year-old his seventh Wimbledon title in a four-set battle at the All England Club. Magnificent. In its 100 years, Centre Court has seen few champions like @DjokerNole#Wimbledon | #CentreCourt100 pic.twitter.com/vffvL2f08Q — Wimbledon (@Wimbledon) July 10, 2022   Although Kyrgios claimed the first set 6-4, the Serbian rallied back in the second set to take it 6-3. Djokovic won the third set 6-4 while the fourth and deciding set ended in a tiebreaker which the world No. 1 won 7-6. With a record 32nd Grand Slam final, Djokovic became the first player to win seven or more titles at two different Grand Slams. The Wimbledon final was his third final showdown against Kyrgios and his first victory over the Aussie. By reaching the final for the eighth time, the Serbian claimed sole ownership of second place in Wimbledon men’s singles final appearances — ahead of Boris Becker, Arthur Gore and Pete Sampras. Roger Federer leads the pack with 12 final berths. Djokovic is now the fourth man in the Open Era to triumph at Wimbledon four times in succession.
