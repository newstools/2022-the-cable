The Ekiti ministry of health says 74 persons are currently positive for COVID in the state. According to Punch, Oyebanji Filani, commissioner for health in the state, announced the development on Saturday in a statement titled ‘Ekiti announces return to strict COVID-19 preventive measures to mitigate increasing nationwide spread’. The commissioner urged residents of the state to comply with COVID preventive measures, and also advised residents to get vaccinated. “Vaccination remains the most effective means of curbing this pandemic and we encourage all residents of the state to get vaccinated. As at today, 384,730 persons are fully vaccinated,” the statement reads. “However, this is not sufficient to achieve herd immunity, hence the re-enforcement of preventive protocols. “As the state Ministry of Health continues to monitor the recent increase of COVID-19 cases across the country, and a recent spike in the state with 74 persons currently positive, all residents of Ekiti State are hereby advised to adhere strictly to the government’s public health and social measures to prevent the spread of COVID-19. “The state has trained and deployed over 80 mobile vaccination teams and 177 health facility-based teams across all local government areas in the state. “Citizens are encouraged to visit the vaccination post nearest to them to get their complete COVID-19 jabs. “The state government will continue to engage with the Federal Ministry of Health, the Nigeria Centre for Disease Control and other partners to ensure constant availability and accessibility of vaccines while heightening surveillance activities to ensure quick detection and mitigation of the spread of COVID-19.”
