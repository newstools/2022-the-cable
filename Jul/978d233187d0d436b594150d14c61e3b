IMF URGES G20 LEADERS TO ADDRESS GLOBAL CHALLENGES Kristalina Georgieva, managing director, International Monetary Fund (IMF), says the global outlook has darkened significantly, and uncertainty is exceptionally high. Georgieva said this on Saturday at the hybrid meeting of the G20 Finance Ministers and Central Bank Governors. The IMF boss urged countries to ensure fiscal policy help — not hinders — central bank efforts to tame inflation. The organisation also called for a fresh impetus for global cooperation will be critical to confronting the multiple crises the world is facing. “We need G20 leadership particularly to address the risks from food insecurity and high debt. Here, I welcome the focus on food security issues during these meetings. Food insecurity means hunger for millions of people. Yet it is a solvable problem,” Georgieva said. “Together with heads of the UNFAO, World Bank, WFP and WTO, the IMF is calling on the international community to step up and work together to support those in immediate need, remove export restrictions, promote food production, and invest in climate-resilient agriculture.”
