One person has been confirmed dead after a boat conveying passengers to Kwata market in Shiroro LGA of Niger capsized. Speaking with TheCable on Sunday, Emmanuel Umar, commissioner for internal security and humanitarian affairs, said the incident happened on Saturday. According to him, the boat capsized after it collided with a rock inside the river. “There was a boat mishap and about 22 people were on the boat. The boat hit a rock,” he said. “As at the time, they were trying to rescue the victims. Only one person got drowned. The name of the person that drowned is Ahmadu Dnasa. The incident happened yesterday at about 11am,” he said. Commenting on the mishap, Haruna Umar, president of Shiroro youth development forum, said the passengers on the boat were traders coming from neighbouring towns to Kwata market, which opens on Saturdays. According to him, seven passengers have been rescued while the remaining persons are yet to be found. “A boat conveying marketers, transporting them to Zumba and Kwata market, capsized. The incident happened while they were still on their way to the market,” he added. “Only seven people out of the unknown number of people have been seen. The rest are nowhere to be found. One is confirmed dead.” Also speaking, Salis Sabo, spokesperson of the coalition of Shiroro youth association (COSA), said there was delay in rescuing the victims as the boat capsized near an area that had been at the mercy of attackers. “When the incident happened, they called the official in charge of the river for assistance, but no one could offer help because the boat capsized at a place where bandits have been terrorising,” he said. “So, the passengers were not urgently rescued because of the area where the incident occurred. “Seven persons were discovered, but six were resuscitated using traditional herbs, and one person died.”
