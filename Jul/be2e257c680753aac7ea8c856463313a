The presence of men clad in clergy robes at the unveiling ceremony of Kashim Shettima as the vice-presidential candidate of the All Progressives Congress (APC) has elicited outrage on social media. The unveiling ceremony took place on Wednesday at the Shehu Musa Yar’Adua Centre in Abuja. Since the pictures of the supposed clergy members surfaced on social media, many Nigerians have been dissecting and analysing the suitability of their garbs. The ruling party has been at the receiving end of the flak, with critics alleging that the individuals are impostors hired to create the impression of an acceptance of the Muslim-Muslim ticket by the Christian community. Below are some reactions from Twitter. This attire is called a chasuble. It is only worn for mass or the celebration of the Eucharist. Catholic priests do not wear the chasuble to attend occasions. Imagine hiring thugs and fools to dress in religious attires to endorse his vp.We are not stupid. #Staged #davidhundeyin pic.twitter.com/Psb7Opmnr9 — Daddy (@NwokeMbaise22) July 20, 2022  Kamoru has been identified as a fake Bishop Peter Okoye.
