Peter Obi, presidential candidate of the Labour Party (LP), has called on his supporters to be tolerant of other viewpoints. He made the appeal in a post via his verified Twitter handle on Sunday. The development comes days after Poju Oyemade, senior pastor of Covenant Christian Centre, faced fierce criticism from supporters of Obi over his social media post. Oyemade had advised youths not to waste their enthusiasm on a “poorly planned project”. Although the clergyman did not mention any name, his advice was seen as an attack on the youth movement of Obi. In a series of tweets, the former Anambra governor said he understood that citizens were frustrated, but urged his supporters to express their opinions with “grace”. Obi also advised them to channel their energy positively and be open to future collaborations. “I sincerely thank my supporters for believing in me and my commitment to building a united, secure and well-functioning Nigeria,” the post reads. “However, I appeal once more that we should be tolerant of other people’s views, dissent and divergent opinions & possibly learn from them. “While the frustration and anger in the country is understandable, we must strive to channel that energy positively in ways that will earn the support and collaboration of others. “Even as our message continues to gain broad acceptance, there are some we still need to work to convince. In expressing ourselves, we should do so with grace so as not to precipitately shut doors to future collaborations on sustainable nation-building.” While the frustration and anger in the country is understandable, we must strive to channel that energy positively in ways that will earn the support and collaboration of others. — Peter Obi (@PeterObi) July 3, 2022
