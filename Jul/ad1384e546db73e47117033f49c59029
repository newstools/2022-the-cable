A mob protesting the killing of one Philip Okoro, identified as a 22-year-old resident of Enugu state, has set ablaze the house of a vigilante group leader. Okoro was said to have been shot to death at Nkpologwu community in Uzo-Uwani council area of the state. Daniel Ndukwe, police spokesman in Enugu, confirmed the incident in a statement on Friday. According to Ndukwe, the alleged shooting happened on June 29 and the victim was quickly rushed to the hospital, after which he was confirmed dead at about 3pm on June 30. He said the corpse had been taken to the mortuary for autopsy and preservation, while the gun allegedly used in the shooting had been recovered. “Consequently, two members of the Vigilante Group directly linked to the shooting and murder of the victim have been arrested,” the statement reads. “They include one Annene Idu, alleged to have shot the deceased, and Chijioke Ezugwu, the Chief Security Officer of the Local Government Area, said to have led the Vigilante Group members to the scene of the incident to arrest hard drugs dealers. “Additionally, the pump action gun used for the act has been recovered as well.” Ndukwe said a mob, while protesting the killing of the victim, set the house of the team leader of the vigilante group on fire. “However, the fire was put out by police operatives, who swiftly mobilised to the scene on receipt of a distress call, before the building could be burnt down,” he said. He added that Lawal Abubakar, commissioner of police in the state, had ordered the deputy commissioner of police in-charge of the state criminal investigation department (CID) to carry out a full-scale investigation into the incident.
