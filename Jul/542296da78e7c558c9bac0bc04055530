Boboye Oyeyemi, corps marshal of the Federal Road Safety Corps (FRSC), says the corps will enforce the ban on SPY number plates by the police. Usman Baba, inspector-general of police (IGP), gave the order on Wednesday. In a statement, Bisi Kazeem, corps public education officer, quoted Oyeyemi as commending the IGP and describing his order as a “bold step”. Oyeyemi asked commanding officers of the corps across the nation “to join hands with the police force to enforce the order”. “Commanding officers should ensure that no stone is left unturned in the enforcement of this very order,” the corps marshal said. “Road users who also parade faded number plates should endeavour to replace them with new ones so as to avoid impounding their vehicles. “[There are] implications of the continued use of faded and other unauthorized vehicle number plates to national security. “The use of the SPY and other unauthorized number plates to continually violate traffic rules and regulations must be brought to a halt, hence the directive given to commanding officers to brace up and ensure that they give adequate priority to the enforcement.” Oyeyemi also asked commanding officers to impound private vehicles that are using commercial number plates.
