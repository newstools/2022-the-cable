The Super Falcons of Nigeria returned to winning ways at the ongoing Women Africa Cup of Nations (WAFCON) after defeating Botswana 2-0 on Thursday night. The entertaining encounter began with both sides trying hard to show supremacy. Goalkeeper Maitumelo Bosija did well to grab the ball from Rita Chikwelu’s delivery in the crowded area. The Super Falcons got their noses in front, thanks to Ifeoma Onumonu who sent a low drive home in the 21st minute. A minute after the half-hour, Rifelwe Tholakele whipped a beautiful free-kick which brought out the best from Falcons keeper Chiamaka Nnadozie. Substitute Christy Ucheibe made a triumphant entry to the game with a sweet header from Tony Payne’s well-crafted corner three minutes after the restart of the second half to make it 2-0. The lively Ucheibe was once again free in the opposition half but sent the ball wide. Striker Ifeoma Onumonu failed to wrap her effort home as she was denied by the keeper after receiving an excellent pass from Monday Gift. Botswana goalkeeper Maitumelo Bosija produced a smart save to foil Halimatu Ayinde in the 79th minute. Despite creating more chances, the Super Falcons couldn’t add to their tally. But the victory will be a relief to the under-fire Randy Waldrum.
