The Ebonyi state working committee (SWC) of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) has suspended Tochukwu Okorie, the state party chairman, over alleged gross misconduct. Emmanuel Nworie, the party’s deputy state chairman, said this on Monday at a media briefing in Abakaliki, the Ebonyi capital. Nworie said the suspension was for a period of one month. He said the chairman was suspended over alleged failure to organise executive meetings for a period of four months since he was reinstated as chairman by the court of appeal in Abuja. Nworie said the suspended chairman abandoned party activities since his reinstatement. In May, the court of appeal sitting in Abuja had ordered the reinstatement of Okorie as Ebonyi PDP chairman, and sacked Silas Onu who was occupying the post. Nworie said Okorie allegedly joined an aspirant to file a suit against the party in the state, adding that such an action is unacceptable to the Ebonyi SWC members. “At the emergency SWC meeting, we reviewed the activities of our chairman, Tochukwu Okorie, and his misconduct,” Nworie said. “The chairman has failed to organise a meeting for more than four months which is against the party’s constitution.” According to NAN, the deputy chairman, legal adviser, publicity secretary, and women leader, were among those at the emergency meeting. Reacting to the development, Okorie described his alleged suspension as illegal. “It is only the national leadership that can suspend me,” he said. “I am a member of the national executive council of the party and no member of the state working committee has the power to suspend me. “On the alleged gross misconduct, I am the chairman as directed by the court. I have the prerogative power to access the party’s account in carrying out party activities.”
