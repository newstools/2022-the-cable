The All Progressives Congress (APC) says Ahmad Usman El-Marzuq, its national legal adviser, did not resign his membership over the Muslim-Muslim ticket choice of the party. In a statement on Monday, Felix Morka, spokesman of the APC, said Daniel Bwala, a legal aide to Ovie Omo-Agege, deputy president of the senate, is not the party’s legal adviser as reported in some news outlets. “Our attention has been drawn to a false and misleading report circulating on some media platforms that the National Legal Adviser of the All Progressives Congress (APC) has resigned,” Morka said. “Barr. Ahmad Usman El-Marzuq is, and remains, the National Legal Adviser of APC. Barr. Daniel Bwala was not the National Legal Adviser of the Party as erroneously reported. “The report is either borne out of mischief or extreme negligence. We urge the general public to kindly disregard.” TheCable reported Bwala’s resignation from the party.
