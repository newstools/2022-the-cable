The police command in Niger says it has recaptured Kazeem Murtala, one of the inmates who escaped during the jailbreak at the Kuje correctional centre in Abuja. A statement by Wasiu Abiodun, the command’s spokesman, said a patrol team on surveillance between the General Hospital, Suleja and Bakassi, arrested the inmate on July 9 at 8:30pm. Last Tuesday, insurgents attacked the correctional service facility in the federal capital territory (FCT). Over 900 inmates, including Boko Haram suspects, escaped. Abiodun explained that based on credible intelligence, the police patrol team arrested the inmate at an unidentified compound. During interrogation, the inmate was said to have confessed that he escaped from Kuje custodial center during the attack and had been in custody for two years for an offence he committed. Commenting on the development, Monday Kuryas, Niger commissioner of police, commended the efforts of the patrol team. Kuryas directed that the inmate should be handed back to the custodial centre. The CP urged residents to continue to support the police with reliable information that could aid in apprehending other suspected criminals and to combat crime and criminality in the state. TheCable had earlier reported that the National Drug Law Enforcement Agency (NDLEA) arrested one Suleiman Sidi, a Boko Haram suspect who escaped from Kuje prison.
