Idahosa, whose church is based in Lagos, hails from Edo state. The development comes weeks after talks to form an alliance with the Labour Party (LP) failed. In June, the party said a committee was set up to lead the discussion for a possible coalition with the LP. The alliance was aimed at challenging the All Progressives Congress (APC) and thr Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) in the 2023 elections. “We wish to inform Nigerians that, our discussions with Peter Obi and the Labour Party are still ongoing. Special committee was set to discuss arrangements. We hope for good results that will give Nigeria a chance to be alive, once again,” the party had said. But in July , Victor Umeh, chieftain of the LP, disclosed that the coalition talks ended on June 15. Umeh, who is vying for a senatorial seat on the LP platform, had said the talks “collapsed completely” because both parties could not agree on who will be the presidential candidate. The former All Progressives Grand Alliance (APGA) national chairman faulted Kwankwaso for giving the impression that the talks between both parties are still in progress.
