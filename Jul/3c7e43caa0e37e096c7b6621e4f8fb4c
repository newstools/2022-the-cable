Nyesom Wike, governor of Rivers, says he will soon speak about Atiku Abubakar, presidential candidate of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP). In an interview granted to ARISE TV, Abubakar said he did not pick Wike as his running mate because he wanted someone he could work with “amicably”. “Governor Wike was not rejected. Nobody was rejected in the party. But you must understand that it’s the prerogative of the candidate to pick his running mate — a running mate he believes he can work with amicably, and then also deliver the policies of the party, and also try to unify the country,” the PDP candidate said. “Governor Wike is a brilliant politician. He’s courageous, tenacious. I believe he has a future in the political evolution of this country. It’s not a question of rejection. Certainly, not. I think it’s too harsh a word to say that we rejected governor Wike.” In a statement on Saturday, Kelvin Ebiri, media aide to Wike, quoted the Rivers governor as saying Nigerians would know the truth about recent events in the party when he eventually speaks. “On Atiku, I will speak soon and Nigerians will know the actual truth of all that has transpired in the PDP in recent times,” Wike was quoted as saying. The development comes amid concerns over Wike’s commitment to participating in the PDP campaign for the 2023 elections. The Rivers governor had lost the presidential ticket to Abubakar, and according to Samuel Ortom, governor of Benue, Wike was preferred as the vice-presidential candidate of the party. However, the PDP presidential candidate had chosen Ifeanyi Okowa, Delta governor, as his running mate.
