Super Falcons of Nigeria started their 2022 Africa Women Cup of Nations (AWCON) campaign with a 2-1 defeat to South Africa’s Banyana Banyana on Monday night. In the opening 10 minutes, the two sides had chances to score but failed to utilise them. Tony Payne and Asisat Oshoala linked up well but the latter met a brick wall inside the opposition area. Banyana Banyana were more purposeful in their approach to the game as they looked very fast, especially on the transition. The first half ended goalless with the two coaches having a lot to say to their wards. At the beginning of the second half, Ayanda Dlamini, South Africa goalkeeper, denied Falcons an early lead before Jermaine Seoposenwe deservedly put the Banyana Banyana in front at the hour mark. Two minutes later, Hildah Magaia doubled the lead for the Banyana Banyana. Atletico Madrid forward Rasheedat Ajibade tried to reduce the deficit but she was prevented from scoring by Dlamini. Despite the introduction of Vivian Ikechukwu, Uchenna Kanu, and Francisca Ordega, the Super Falcons could only get a consolatory goal to reduce the tally as the game ended 2-1 in favour of Desiree Ellis girls. South Africa defeated Nigeria 4-2 in the Aisha Buhari Cup final in September last year.
