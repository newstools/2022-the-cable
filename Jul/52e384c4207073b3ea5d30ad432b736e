Olajide Adeniran, governorship candidate of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) in Lagos, says Babajide Sanwo-Olu, governor of Lagos, should start preparing to leave office. Adeniran, better known as Jandor, said this in a statement issued on Sunday to celebrate his party’s victory in the Osun governorship election. Ademola Adeleke of the PDP was declared winner after polling 403,371 votes to defeat APC’s Adegboyega Oyetola, incumbent governor, who secured 375,027 votes. In a statement on Sunday, the PDP candidate expressed optimism that like Osun, his party would win in Lagos in the 2023 elections. “I congratulate the good people of Osun state for liberating themselves from the whims and caprices of incompetent governance. This election is a testimony that the era of mediocre leadership is finally over,” the statement reads. “Osun state mirrors the hardship and misrule that the people of Lagos have endured for over two decades. It shows the incompetence that turns people into beggars amid plenty, where the collective patrimony of the people is shared by Sherlocks. “The jury is out; Nigerians and, most significantly, Lagosians are tired of the decades of slavery. The youths are fed up with a puppet whose hands are always tied. “I hereby call on Mr Babajide Sanwo-Olu to put finishing touches on his handover notes and prepare to leave office.”
