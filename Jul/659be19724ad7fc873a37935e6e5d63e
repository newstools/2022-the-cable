The United States has asked its citizens to observe a “high state of security” in Nigeria’s federal capital territory (FCT). The US embassy in Nigeria issued the advice following an attack on a correctional service facility in Kuje in the FCT. Gunmen had attacked the prison with explosives on Tuesday night, with over 500 inmates said to be at large. The Islamic State in West Africa Province (ISWAP) has claimed responsibility for the attack. In a statement on Wednesday, the US embassy said “crime is endemic throughout Nigeria” and it is expected to escalate, warning its citizens to avoid areas that increase the chances of attack. “The prison lies approximately 27 miles southwest of the Central Business District. An increase in crime is expected in and around Abuja,” the statement reads. “It is recommended that U.S. citizens should maintain a high state of personal security awareness for the next two weeks and avoid unnecessary travel on the airport road. “Crime is endemic throughout Nigeria and tends to spike after dark.  Avoiding locations and situations that increase the likelihood of being victimized is the best defence.  Avoid displays of valuables and limit nighttime activity.” Similarly, the United Kingdom has advised its citizens in Nigeria against travelling to states that have witnessed attacks in recent weeks. According to the statement by the Foreign, Commonwealth & Development Office (FCDO), UK citizens are to avoid travel to Borno, Yobe, Adamawa, Gombe, Kaduna, Katsina, Zamfara, riverine areas of Delta, Bayelsa, Rivers, Akwa Ibom and Cross River. The FCDO added that only essential travel should be made to Bauchi, Kano, Jigawa, Niger, Sokoto, Kogi, within 20km of the border with Niger in Kebbi, Abia, non-riverine areas of Delta, Bayelsa and Rivers, Plateau and Taraba, adding that citizens should be “extra vigilant if in the area”.
