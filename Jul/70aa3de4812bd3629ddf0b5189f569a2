Atiku Abubakar, presidential candidate of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP), says he is open to meeting with Nyesom Wike, governor of Rivers state. Abubakar said this on Thursday while fielding questions from journalists in Osogbo, Osun state capital. When asked if the party is divided into factions, Abubakar said: “It is a social media drama. There is nothing like a Wike camp or Atiku camp. There is one PDP family.” Atiku was also asked if there is a plan to meet with Wike for reconciliation, and he responded by saying: “Why not? I am open to that.” The former vice-president added that the party will surmount its present challenges. “Some people get angry when things don’t go their way and so on and so forth. We will overcome that. I have every belief that we are going to do that,” he said. The opposition party has been embroiled in rancour since Abubakar named Ifeanyi Okowa, governor of Delta state, as his running mate for the 2023 presidential election. Some party stakeholders, including Samuel Ortom, governor of Benue, had expressed concerns over Atiku’s decision to overlook Wike, who was recommended for the position by the party’s national working committee (NWC). Wike placed second in the party’s presidential primary election which took place in May. A few days ago, Abubakar had said actions are being taken to address the grievances of party members. “We are taking action to address the feelings of all party members,” the former vice-president had said. “The unity in our community is my priority. Our resolve to unify Nigeria starts in our party and moves to the community, then on to society.”
