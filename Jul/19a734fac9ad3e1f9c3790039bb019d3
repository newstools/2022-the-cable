A mob, on Monday, set ablaze two suspects in Enugu for allegedly raping a 10-year-old girl to death in Ede-Oballa, Nsukka LGA of the state. According to NAN, a resident of the community, who pleaded anonymity, said the body of the 10-year-old girl was found in a bush with her private parts removed. He said the suspects were arrested by a neighbourhood watch team, but were overpowered by a crowd. “The natives have been worried that ritualists have entered into the community,” NAN quoted the resident as saying. “Only ritualists will rape a girl to death and remove her vital organs for their evil acts. “That was why when residents heard that the perpetrators of the dastardly act had been arrested by the neighbourhood watch, everybody rushed to its office. “The crowd overpowered the security men and grabbed the two ritualists that killed the girl and set them on fire and watched them burn to death. “It was the intention of the security men to take the suspects to the police, but they were overpowered by the mob.” Daniel Ndukwe, Enugu police spokesman, couldn’t be reached for comments on the incident.
