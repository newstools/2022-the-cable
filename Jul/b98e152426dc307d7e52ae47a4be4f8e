Asisat Oshoala, Super Falcons striker, has been listed among the final three nominees for the 2022 CAF women’s player of the year award. CAF revealed the final shortlist for the categories of the awards in a statement on its website on Wednesday. Oshoala is the only Nigerian who made the final shortlist across all categories. Three of her compatriots — Rasheedat Ajibade, Uchenna Kanu, and Chiamaka Nnadozie — had made the 30-woman list released earlier this year. Oshoala is the current holder of the top prize which she won the last time the awards were held in 2019. She has won the award on four occasions — a joint record alongside Perpetua Nkwocha, former Falcons striker. She will be gunning for her fifth gong against Cameroonian Ajara Nchout Njoya and Grace Chanda of Zambia. In the men’s category, Mohamed Salah and Sadio Mane will be hoping to add another prize to their respective collections against Eduard Mendy. The winners will be announced at a gala in Rabat, Morrocco, on July 21. Player of the Year (Women)
