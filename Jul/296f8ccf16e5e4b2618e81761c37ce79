The interim management committee (IMC) for the Nigeria Basketball Federation (NBBF) has postponed the coaches and technical officials clinic scheduled for July 3 in Abuja. The postponement, at the instance of the sports ministry, may have been occasioned by the clash of programmes of the ministry, especially with the lifting of the two-year ban on international competitions and the reinstatement of the NBBF by the ministry. According to the ministry’s sources, however, the ongoing World Cup qualifiers in Kigali, Rwanda may have also caused the shift of the clinic to allow for wider participation as the IMC plans to announce a new date soon. Interestingly, the sports ministry is yet to take a definitive stand on the continued existence of the IMC it recently constituted to manage grassroots basketball. Meanwhile, the IMC members are currently agitating for a defined role and approval of its programmes in the wake of Nigeria’s return to international competitions.
