Gboyega Oyetola, governor of Osun, says he will be reelected. Speaking with journalists after voting on Saturday, Oyetola said the people are “conscious” and see the need to participate in the process. The governor said once the process is transparent, there would not be a need to ask people to vote. “The election is going smoothly. It is important to deplore the machine so as to ensure that the voting process can be completed within the time frame,” he said. “I have seen the presence of the security. I think they are doing well. I see the enthusiasm the voters are displaying and I am particularly grateful to them. “I believe people are conscious of the need to participate in the process. Once the process is transparent enough, people will not be persuaded to vote. There won’t be voter apathy. It is indeed very impressive. “By the grace of the Almighty God, I am confident I will be reelected.” Earlier, on his social media pages, Oyetola asked the people to be resolute in voting. My good people of Osun, As we go to the polls today, let us go about it peacefully. Let us eschew violence, brigandage, disorderliness or anything that could disrupt the peaceful atmosphere we all have been enjoying in the State. pic.twitter.com/SD6xILzTzY — Adegboyega Oyetola (@GboyegaOyetola) July 16, 2022  “Let me in particular, appeal to members and supporters of our great party, the All Progressives Congress, APC, to exercise their civic rights peacefully,” he said. “Be resolute to cast your vote. However, portray yourselves and the party in the best possible form of comportment and orderliness. I equally urge other political gladiators to promote peace and tranquillity. Our peaceful coexistence supersedes any political ambition.” Oyetola is up against Ademola Adeleke, candidate of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP), and Yusuff Lasun, candidate of the Labour Party (LP).
