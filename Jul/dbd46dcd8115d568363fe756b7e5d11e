The Kano ministry of health says it has shut down 26 “illegal” health training institutions in the state. Hadiza Namadi, information officer of the ministry, announced the development in a statement on Friday. According to the statement, some of the institutions offer programmes that are not in the established course curricula, while some charge high fees. “The Kano State Ministry of Health has noticed with serious concern, the incessant proliferation of illegal Private Health Training Institutions (PHTIs) in the State without recourse to extant regulations governing the establishment and operation of such schools as specified regulatory bodies and other relevant authorities,” the statement reads. “It is of serious dismay to realise that some of those unrecognised institutions lack definite sites and offer dubious programmes against the established course curricula, while also extorting exorbitant fees on students and their parents. “Suffice to indicate, this ugly trend is at the detriment of the people, educational development and efficiency of the entire health system. “Consequently, the general public is hereby informed of the instant shut-down of all illegal Health Training Institutions (HTIs) in the State, pending the outcome of necessary investigations. “People are equally required to note that only the duly registered institutions and accredited courses should be patronised as any subscription to unrecognised schools is tantamount to self-subjection to security risks, doomed academic and career prospects, as well as financial deceptions. “The ministry will cooperate with all stakeholder agencies to ensure regular monitoring and inspection of the Health Training Institutions (HTIs) across the state for sanity and safety.” See the list of affected institutions below. 1) Unity College of Health Science & Technology, Gwale LGA/Danbatta LGA 2) Khalil College of Health Science & Technology, Zaria road/Darmanawa/Unguwa Uku/Tarauni LGA/Danbatta LGA/Wudil LGA 3) Shamila College of Health Science & Technology, Gezawa LGA 4) Autan Bawo College of Health Science & Technology, Rano LGA 5) Trustee College of Health Science & Technology, Dala LGA/Ungoggo LGA 6) Eagle College of Health Science & Technology, Bichi LGA 7) Albakari College of Health Science & Technology, Ungoggo LGA 8) Jamatu College of Health Science & Technology, Kura LGA 9) Savanna College of Health Science & Technology, Wudil LGA 10) Institute of Health Education, Ahmadiyya 11) Jamilu Chiroma College of Health Science & Technology, Sabon Gari 12) Sir Sanusi College of Health Science & Technology, Matan Fada road 13) Aminu Ado Bayero College of Health Science & Technology, Dala LGA 14) Awwab College of Health Science & Technology, Gwale LGA 15) Gwarzo Unity College of Health Science & Technology, Gwarzo LGA 16) Al-wasa’u College of Health Science & Technology, Nassarawa LGA 17) Kanima Academy, Nassarawa LGA 18) Muslim College of Health Science & Technology, Fagge LGA 19) Utopia College of Health Science & Technology, Nassarawa LGA 20) Jama’a College of Health Science & Technology, Tarauni LGA 21) Kausar Healthcare Academy, T/Wada LGA 22) Shanono College of Health Science & Technology, Shanono, LGA 23) Institute of Basic Health Education, Nassarawa LGA 24) School of Health Technology, Kuma T/Fulani 25) School of Health Technology, Ungoggo LGA 26) Fudiyya School of Health Sciences, Fagge LGA
