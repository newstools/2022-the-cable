Vice-President Yemi Osinbajo has disowned a viral memo purportedly from his office, seeking the permission of President Muhammadu Buhari to resign from the All Progressives Congress (APC). “Permission to Resign from APC,” reads the headline of the memo, dated June 24, 2022, with reference number SH/VP/605/2./0 According to the letter circulating on social media, family pressure was mentioned as the reason for the vice-president’s decision. The memo, purportedly signed by Osinbajo reads: “I have the honour to inform you that for some time now, I have been having series of meetings and pressure from my immediate family members on some matters. “One of the issues borders on my continuous participation on active and partisan politics, and by extension, my continuous membership of our party, the All Progressives Congress, APC. “As a father and great member, whom without you, I would not be where I am today, regrettably, I write to seek for your permission to resign my membership of the All Progressives Congress, APC. “However, if the timing of this plan is not convenience or acceptable by Your Excellency, I will surely abide by your decision and advice, which I will consider to be the final. “Please accept the assurances of my highest regards and loyalty.” TheCable reached out to Laolu Akande, the spokesperson of the vice-president, and he disowned the viral letter.  He said the memo, full of errors, easily gives it away. “The letter is not from the vice-president. It is fake,” he said.
