Super Falcons of Nigeria have defeated Cameroon 1-0 in the quarter-finals of the 2022 Women’s Africa Cup of Nations. The match was played at the Stade Mohammed V Stadium in Morocco on Thursday. The victory ensured that the Super Falcons will be playing at the FIFA Women’s World Cup in 2023. In the beginning of the encounter, the two sides showed desire and hunger to attack and get an early goal. Cameroon goalkeeper Ange Bawou did well to prevent a low cross from Francisca Ordega from entering the post on nine minutes. In the 24th minute, a corner by Ngozi Okeoghene met the head of Ashleigh Plumptre but Bawou ensured it was saved. Super Falcons kept bombarding the Cameroonian team as Ifeoma Onumonu forced Bawou to make another save. Rasheedat Ajibade and Christy Ucheibe had chances to draw the curtain raiser but were wasteful as the first half ended 0-0. Twelve minutes into the second half, the Super Falcons got a goal, thanks to Ajibade’s excellent header. The experienced Aboudi should have equalised for the Indomitable Lionesses seven minutes after the hour but her effort went wide. An excellent pass over Cameroon’s backline ended at the path of Onumonu as the US-based forward blazed the ball wide with five minutes left on the clock. Despite late forays from Cameroon, Super Falcons held on to a 1-0 win.
