Armed robbers have attacked a lodge of the National Youth Service Corps (NYSC) members in Uyo LGA of Akwa Ibom state. The robbers invaded the compound at about 1am on Wednesday and carted away valuables, including laptops, cell phones, and money. “They arrived on a tricycle, popularly called keke, and immediately started operation,” one of the youth corps members told TheCable. “They beamed high-intensity torchlights everywhere and pounced on every door with heavy iron and threatened to shoot us if we failed to cooperate.” A female corps member, who pleaded anonymity, said her phones, laptop, and money were forcefully taken after the attackers entered her room through the back door. Odiko Ogbeche Macdon, the spokesperson of the Akwa Ibom police command, confirmed the incident. “There was a robbery incident in the compound and some corpers were affected. However, as soon as the incident happened, they called the police. Immediately the robbers heard the sound of the police, they escaped,” he said. The police spokesperson however denied that the attackers raped the female corps members. “That information is false, they are even trying to retract it now, nobody was raped. Akwa Ibom is still one of the most peaceful states in this country,” he said.
