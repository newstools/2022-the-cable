Bello Matawalle, governor of Zamfara, has asked traditional rulers in the state to seek approval before awarding chieftaincy titles. The governor gave the directive in a statement issued on Wednesday by Zailani Bappa, his special adviser on public enlightenment, media and communications. The development comes days after Aliyu Marafa, Emir of Yandoton Daji, made Adamu Yankuzo, a wanted bandit kingpin popularly known as Ada Aleru, the Sarkin Fulani of the emirate. The turbaning of Ada Aleru sparked criticism as many Nigerians accused the state government and security operatives of treating bandits with kid gloves. Subsequently, Matawalle suspended Marafa for awarding the chieftaincy title. In the statement, the Zamfara governor warned that any emir who refused to get official permission before awarding chieftaincy titles would be seriously reprimanded. “All emirs, senior district heads and district heads in the state are hereby directed to officially seek permission from the state government before conferring traditional titles on anyone,” the governor was quoted as saying in the statement. “Henceforth, no emir, senior district head or district head must appoint anybody into any traditional office without securing official permission and clearance from the state government. “Compliance to this directive is now mandatory and failure to it will attract serious reprimand from the state government.” On several occasions, the state government had suspended emirs over alleged collaboration with bandits in the state. In June 2021, Matawalle suspended Hussaini Umar, Emir of Dansadau in Maru LGA of the state, for his alleged involvement in banditry.
