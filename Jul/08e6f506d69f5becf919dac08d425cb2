Enyinnaya Abaribe, former minority leader of the senate, will chair the investiture of Max Amuchie, founder of Sundiata Post, as the sixth president of the Rotary Club of Abuja Central Business District (CBD). Mohammed Buba Marwa, chairman of the Nigerian Drug Law Enforcement Agency (NDLEA), is billed to be the special guest of honour. In a statement, Evelyn Onyilo, media coordinator of the investiture planning committee, said the event will be held at Chelsea Hotel in Abuja at 4 pm on Friday. Onyilo said Stanley Amuchie, an executive director of Fidelity Bank, would deliver a lecture as guest speaker. “He will speak on the nexus between philanthropy and Rotary’s values. Some Nigerians who have distinguished themselves in Rotary’s areas of focus would be honoured with awards,” she said. The media coordinator said the investiture would be used to raise funds for the projects the club intends to execute in the 2022/23 Rotary year. “The club also intends to expand its payment of WAEC/NECO fees of indigent students of Interact Club at Army Day Secondary School, Asokoro, Abuja,” she said. “Rotary Club of Abuja CBD plans to build a block of classrooms and two toilets at Central Primary School, Gidan Gimba, the club’s adopted community in Nasarawa state.” Amuchie is also the founder of Dealboku, an e-commerce enterprise platform.
