A keyword search on credible news platforms revealed no report to buttress the claim. Lasun, the Labour Party gubernatorial candidate, debunked the claim on Arise News. “Adeleke is my brother, but I can never step down for him,” he said. Verdict The claim that the Labour Party gubernatorial candidate in Osun has stepped down for Adeleke of the PDP is false.
