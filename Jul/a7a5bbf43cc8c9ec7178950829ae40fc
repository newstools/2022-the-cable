Several United Kingdom (UK) cabinet ministers are reportedly at the office of Prime Minister Boris Johnson to ask him to resign. According to Sky News, the delegation is said to include Grant Shapps, transport secretary; Simon Hart, Welsh secretary; Brandon Lewis, Northern Ireland secretary; and Chris Heaton-Harris, chief whip. Nadhim Zahawi, the new chancellor who replaced Rishi Sunak, is also believed to be in the delegation. Johnson’s cabinet has been hit by a wave of ministerial resignations following the latest scandal to engulf his government. Will Quince, minister for children and families; Robin Walker, minister of state for school standards, and John Glen, treasury minister, resigned their positions earlier in the day. On Tuesday, Sajid Javid, UK secretary of state for health and social care, and Rishi Sunak, UK treasury chief, resigned from the cabinet. Their resignations came after Johnson apologised for his handling of the concerns raised over Chris Pincher, deputy chief whip, following allegations of sexual misconduct. Pincher resigned as deputy chief whip last week over claims that he groped two men at a private members’ club. Earlier in the year, Johnson appointed Pincher as the deputy chief whip, despite allegations of sexual misconduct against him. Though Johnson had apologised again for backing Pincher, he vowed to fight on. “The job of a prime minister in difficult circumstances, when he has been handed a colossal mandate, is to keep going, and that’s what I’m going to do,” he had said. Several conservatives have also called on him to resign. Meanwhile, the development comes days after Johnson scaped through a no-confidence vote.
