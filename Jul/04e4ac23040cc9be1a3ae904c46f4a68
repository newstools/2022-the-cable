The National Labour Congress (NLC) says it will embark on a nationwide protest on July 26 and 27 in solidarity with the strike by the Academic Staff Union of Universities (ASUU). ASUU has been on strike for months over the failure of the federal government to honour an agreement on issues bordering on funding universities, as well as on salaries and allowances of lecturers. In a letter dated July 15 and addressed to chairpersons of the NLC in the states, Ayuba Wabba, the congress’ national president, and Emmanuel Ugboaja, general secretary, said the protest is aimed at getting “our children back to school and support our unions in Nigeria’s public universities fighting for quality education”. They designated Labour House in the federal capital territory (FCT) and secretariats of the NLC as the takeoff points for the protest. “We bring you fraternal greetings from the national secretariat of the Nigeria Labour Congress (NLC),” the letter read. “In line with the decisions of the National Executive Council (NEC) meeting of the Nigeria Labour Congress held on the 30th of June 2022, we have scheduled as follows the National Days of Protest to get our children back to school and support our unions in Nigeria’s public universities fighting for quality education. “Dates: Tuesday, 26th July 2022 and Wednesday, 27th July 2022. “Venue: All the State Capitals of the Federation and Abuja the Federal Capital Territory.
