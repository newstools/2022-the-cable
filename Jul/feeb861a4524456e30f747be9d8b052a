The Katsina state police command says Ado Aleru, suspected kidnap kingpin who was given a chieftaincy title in Zamfara, has been on its wanted list. Aleru was turbaned as the Sarkin Fulani by Aliyu Marafa, Emir of Birnin Yandoto of Tsafe LGA, on Saturday. The traditional ruler is said to have given him the title to prevent attacks on his emirate. Consequently, Bello Matawalle, governor of Zamfara, suspended the emir. This is not the first time Matawalle will do so. In 2021, the governor suspended at least three traditional rulers for their alleged involvement in banditry. Speaking with Channels Television on Monday, Gambo Isah, spokesman of the police command in Katsina, said Aleru is wanted for alleged homicide, terrorism, armed robbery, and kidnapping in the north-western state. Isah said the kidnap kingpin is responsible for the killing of over 100 residents in Kadisau village in Faskari LGA in Katsina. The bandit attacked the village in June. After the attack on Kadisau, the police put a N5 million bounty on his head. Aleru is known for terrorising Katsina and Zamfara states.
