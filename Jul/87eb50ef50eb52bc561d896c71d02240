Hadi Sirika, minister of aviation, has warned against the plan by aviation unions to shut down airports in solidarity with the Academic Staff Union of Universities (ASUU). The Association of Nigeria Aviation Professionals (ANAP) had said its members would join the strike if the federal government fails to resolve the issues with ASUU. Speaking with state house correspondents at the presidential villa, Abuja, on Wednesday, the minister said it would be disastrous if the threat is manifested. The minister said the action, if implemented, would be a security risk. He said: “I’m naturally concerned about this. If the aviation union will shut down in support of ASUU, I would say they have no need to. I will say also that we should begin to look at civil aviation as a critical national security enterprise. It has all the implications. “We should not contemplate or think about an aviation disaster. We should also think about the general activity on the economy of Nigeria without civil aviation. “This is democracy, you can push for demands, but in pressing for demands, you should be reasonable in doing so. “So, civil aviation workers, I think should not be part of this. Yes, I am concerned and yes we’ve spoken to them and I don’t think they will join because they know that there’s a huge responsibility for lives on their heads. If you’re an air traffic controller, it involves national security. It involves the capability of preventing external aggression and so on and so forth. “I believe that they are very aware of the enormous responsibility upon them in civil aviation and they should continue to see it so and continue to be as law-abiding as we want them to be.” The minister asked the aviation unions to reconsider the action, adding that there is a “huge responsibility of lives on their heads”.
