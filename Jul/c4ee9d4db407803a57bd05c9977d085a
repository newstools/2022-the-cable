Gunmen have killed a driver working with the Katsina State Transport Authority (KSTA). Haruna Musa, KSTA managing director, confirmed the incident to NAN on Sunday. According to Musa, the driver, identified as Nasir Yusha’u, was shot dead by bandits who were passing through the route when the driver got to the area with passengers on board the vehicle. “He was coming from Jibia to Katsina at about 11am when he ran into the bandits. Immediately the driver saw them, he tried to stop and go back,” he said. “But unfortunately for him, one of the tyres of the vehicle was hooked by sand. That was how they shot him to death, and the passengers started running. “The bandits collected the phones and other things belonging to some of the passengers and left the scene. “The conductor of the vehicle who narrated to us what actually happened said none of the passengers was kidnapped by the bandits. “Since then, we have not heard any report that one of the passengers in the vehicle is missing.” The development comes amid attacks on communities in Katsina state and across the country.
