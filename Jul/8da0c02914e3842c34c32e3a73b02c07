An English Premier League (EPL) star has been arrested in north London over a rape allegation. According to BBC, the player is 29-year-old but cannot be named due to legal reasons. The footballer, who is said to be of international renown, is currently in police custody and is being questioned over the alleged rape which is said to have happened in June. The London metropolitan police confirmed the arrest in a statement that read: “On 4 July, an allegation of rape of a woman in her 20s was reported to the police. “It was reported the alleged rape happened in June 2022. On 4 July, a 29-year-old man was arrested at an address in Barnet on suspicion of rape and taken into custody where he remains. “Enquiries into the circumstances are ongoing.” The two EPL clubs in north London are Arsenal and Tottenham Hotspur. The unnamed footballer is the third EPL star embroiled in rape and sexual assaults in the last one year. Last August, Benjamin Mendy, the Manchester City defender, was charged with four counts of rape and one count of sexual assault. In January, Mason Greenwood, the Manchester United striker, was also arrested over claims that he attacked and raped Harriet Robson, who happens to be his ex-girlfriend. The 20-year-old was, however, released on bail amid a continuous investigation of the case.
