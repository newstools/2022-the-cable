Peter Obi, standard bearer of the Labour party (LP), says he would like a younger person as his running mate. He said his party is considering a number of people to be his running mate, including Hakeem Baba-Ahmed, spokesman of the Northern Elders Forum (NEF). The former governor of Anambra said this on Wednesday in an interview on Arise Television. There has been a speculation about who Obi would pick as running mate for the 2023 elections. “We’re talking to quite a number of people and Hakeem Baba-Ahmed is a capable hand. But I wish I could work with somebody who is younger,” he said. “I prefer younger people who have a lot to offer rather than recycling old hands. I want a competent person and I am building a formidable team. “I want people who can look me in the eye and disagree with me during cabinet meetings. People who have their own minds and ideas.” On June 17, LP announced Doyin Okupe, former senior special assistant on public affairs to ex-President Goodluck Jonathan, as placeholder VP candidate.
