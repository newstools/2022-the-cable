The Federal Character Commission (FCC) says it will prosecute chief executives of ministries, departments, and agencies (MDAs) found to be involved in illegal recruitment and promotion. Muheeba Dankaka, chairperson of the FCC, said this on Tuesday at an event to mark the FCC board’s second anniversary. President Muhammadu Buhari appointed members of the board in April 2020. Dankaka said operational committees had changed, adding that there is now more oversight and enforcement, and zero tolerance for non-compliance. “May I, therefore, call on ministries, departments and agencies to abide by our extant circulars on recruitment as it is an offence to recruit, or conduct promotion exercises without recourse to the Federal Character Commission,” she said. “The commission is poised for a strategic prosecution of any MDA, or particularly any chief executive who disregard our guidelines and laws.” She said in two years since the inauguration of the board, they have tried to live up to expectations. “We have worked to consolidate on the gains of the past. I am happy to announce the final process towards embarking on the equitable distribution of infrastructural facilities, social amenities and economic facilities,” she said. Dankaka added that the ministry of finance, budget and national planning has given the commission permission to participate in MDA budget procedures in order to offer suggestions for fair and equitable project allocation during the planning and execution phases. “It is against this background that the committee on the formula for the distribution pattern of the infrastructural facilities and social-economic amenities has concluded their assignment,” the FCC board chair said. “We will be deliberating on the report and after approval by the plenary, the document will be submitted to Mr President for his approval according to the law.”
