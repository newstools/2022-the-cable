GetEquity, a Nigerian-based platform, is set to hold a startup festival to reshape the technology ecosystem. The two-day festival will hold on July 29 and 30, 2022, at the Landmark Event Centre, Victoria Island, Lagos. According to GetEquity, the event aims to bring startups together with investors and supporters by creating a space that fosters innovation, networking and synergy across several sub-sectors within the ecosystem. “GetEquity is presenting an opportunity to startups to increase their visibility and pitch their services to an audience of over 2000 tech operators, investors and founders alike,” the company said. “Startups can be a part of the GetEquity Startup Festival as an exhibitor where they get the chance to showcase their products and services in a dedicated branded booth of their own. “It also presents an opportunity for founders to connect with other industry players and meet investors. “There is a need to talk about the problems affecting the industry to come up with actionable solutions to address them for good. <img class="alignnone wp-image-720342 size-large" src="https://f5p3e9e4.stackpathcdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/IMG_20220617_105158_691-1024x1024.jpg" alt="" width="900" height="900" srcset="https://f5p3e9e4.stackpathcdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/IMG_20220617_105158_691-1024x1024.jpg 1024w, https://f5p3e9e4.stackpathcdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/IMG_20220617_105158_691-300x300.jpg 300w, https://f5p3e9e4.stackpathcdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/IMG_20220617_105158_691-150x150.jpg 150w, https://f5p3e9e4.stackpathcdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/IMG_20220617_105158_691-768x768.jpg 768w, https://f5p3e9e4.stackpathcdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/IMG_20220617_105158_691-24x24.jpg 24w, https://f5p3e9e4.stackpathcdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/IMG_20220617_105158_691-36x36.jpg 36w, https://f5p3e9e4.stackpathcdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/IMG_20220617_105158_691-48x48.jpg 48w, https://f5p3e9e4.stackpathcdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/IMG_20220617_105158_691.jpg 1080w" sizes="(max-width: 900px) 100vw, 900px" /> “There is a need to look back on all that is going well with the industry and compare with all the wrongs and seek plans that will replicate the successes and minimise the failures. “It is also important to make plans to incorporate and guide new industry players to ensure the accomplishment of more success in the coming years. “Conversations around the future of the tech and startup industry in Nigeria is the reason why GetEquity is holding the startup festival. “As an industry stakeholder, it is important that you join in the conversation that shapes the future of the tech industry in Nigeria.” The company also said the event would take an in-depth look at how Nigeria’s tech industry can solve the problems associated with the ecosystem.
