Ademola Adeleke, the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) candidate for the Osun governorship election, says he has no plan to buy votes in the July 16 governorship election. The governorship candidate addressed his “pounds, dollars and euros” boast during the governorship election debate organised by Channels Television on Sunday. Adeleke, while addressing some members of the PDP in Osun in May, said he was more prepared for the 2022 governorship race than in 2018 when Adegboyega Oyetola, the incumbent governor, defeated him. “Osun people, you are the ones to decide. If it is about money, I have enough. I came with plenty of money. And it is not only naira; I came with dollars, pounds, and euros. This time in Osun, it is fire for fire,” he said in Yoruba. When asked during the debate if his foreign currency reserve was to buy votes, Adeleke said it was a description of the foreign investment he intends to bring into Osun state. “First of all, our family is known for philanthropy, we give people scholarships home and abroad. So, when I was talking about pounds and dollars I meant I will use my international connections to bring investments into Osun state,” he said. “When you’re too popular, when you say one thing, they’ll twist it. When you talk of propaganda, this present government are the best at it.” This is the second consecutive Osun governorship poll where Adeleke will be going up against the incumbent governor. After losing the 2018 contest to Oyetola, the PDP candidate described the election as a “stolen mandate”.
