Atiku Abubakar, presidential candidate of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP), is expected to attend the grand rally of the party in Osun state, TheCable understands. According to sources, the PDP candidate is cutting his European trip short ahead of the final rally before the governorship election slated for Saturday. Atiku was criticised over his absence at the Ekiti governorship campaign trail. Biodun Oyebanji, the All Progressives Congress (APC) candidate, won the Ekiti governorship election, defeating Bisi Kolawole, standard-bearer of the PDP, and Segun Oni, flag bearer of the Social Democratic Party (SDP). Ahead of the Osun election, there have been cracks in the main opposition party. The decision of Atiku to pick Ifeanyi Okowa, Delta state governor, as his running mate over Nyesom Wike, has been a major source of disgruntlement among some stakeholders in the party. Samuel Ortom, Benue state governor, and Ayo Fayose, former governor of Ekiti state, are among the critics of Atiku’s choice. Fayose recently ruffled feathers by saying the presidency should shift to the south in 2023, despite Atiku being a northerner. Although there are speculations that Wike may leave the party, Bukola Saraki, former senate president, has said the Rivers governor will not defect. Ahead of the Osun poll, the PDP has been making efforts to resolve the crisis in its fold. Ademola Adeleke, the governorship candidate of the PDP, will be challenging the incumbent governor, Adegboyega Oyetola, who is seeking reelection. Adeleke also contested the governorship election in Osun in 2018 — but lost to Oyetola.
