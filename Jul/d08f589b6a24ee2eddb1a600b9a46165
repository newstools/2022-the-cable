The Ogun state police command has announced the arrest of Yakubu Abdulmumuni, one of the inmates that escaped from Kuje prison. Last Tuesday, insurgents attacked the correctional service facility in the federal capital territory (FCT). Over 900 inmates, including several Boko Haram suspects, escaped from the prison. Abimbola Oyeyemi, spokesperson of the Ogun police command, said the escaped inmate was arrested on Monday in the Sango-Ota area of the state. Oyeyemi said Abdulmumuni, 28, was arrested following information received by policemen at divisional headquarters, Sango-Ota, that the convict was sighted around the area. “Upon the information, the Divisional Police Officer, Sango-Ota Division, SP Saleh Dahiru, quickly mobilised his men and moved to the area where the convict was apprehended,” Oyeyemi said. “The convict confessed to the Police that he escaped from Kuje Correctional centre on July 5, when the centre was attacked by bandits. “Abdulmumuni stated further that he was convicted by Kogi state High Court for offence of conspiracy and culpable homicide and sent to Kuje Correctional Centre.” He said Lanre Bankole, commissioner of police in the state, had ordered the criminal investigation department to transfer the convict to the correctional facility with immediate effect.
