The Ogun government has commiserated with the family of Sunday Ogunjimi, a teacher in the state, who died on Friday. Ogunjimi was said to be attending a meeting involving members of the Nigeria Labour Congress (NLC) in the state, following the strike embarked upon by workers over alleged unpaid allowances and other matters. He, however, reportedly slumped and died at the state secretariat during the meeting. The strike, which began on Tuesday, was called off on Friday evening. Speaking on the development in a statement issued over the weekend by Nafiu Aigoro, Ogun head of service, Dapo Abiodun, governor of the state expressed his sympathy to the family of the deceased teacher. “We are pained by the unfortunate death of your colleague, who until his death, was a teacher and member of the Nigeria Union of Teachers (NUT) in Odeda Local Government Area,” the statement reads. “As a worker-friendly government, losing a worker in such a circumstance is so devastating. We pray that God will grant the deceased eternal rest and comfort the family, colleagues and associates he left behind.” According to the statement, the governor said his administration remains committed to improving the welfare and wellbeing of the workforce, adding that the state would endeavour to honour the terms of agreement reached with the labour leaders. Abiodun also said while death is an “an inevitable end to all mortals”, residents should endeavour to take their health more seriously through regular medical check-ups, physical exercise and good rest. “On our part, government has invested a lot in the health sector, and even provided a health insurance scheme that is worker-friendly and affordable at all levels, starting with our primary health centres up to the tertiary level,” he added.
