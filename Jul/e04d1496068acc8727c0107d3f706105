A leader of the Civilian Joint Task Force (CJTF) in Borno has been killed in an ambush by suspected fighters of the Islamic State in West Africa Province (ISWAP). The leader, identified as Mandama, was killed alongside four other members of the CJTF. According to Zagazola Makama, a publication focused on the Lake Chad region, the CJTF leader and his members were killed in an ambush on soldiers in Gubio LGA of the state. The CJTF members were said to be on patrol with soldiers when they ran into the ambush. Gubio is about 80 kilometres north of Maiduguri, the Borno capital. The military convoy was said to be on on a fighting patrol in the early hours of Monday between Gubio and Magumeri, when they were ambushed by the insurgents around river Kulu’u Isaram. A source, according to Zagazola Makama, said the attackers opened fire on the vehicle conveying the CJTF leader. Other sources also said some of the troops sustained bullet wounds during a crossfire with the insurgents. “The deceased were evacuated to Gubio town, to be buried later in the day,” a source was quoted as saying. Onyema Nwachukwu, army spokesman, was not immediately available to comment on the attack. In June, three members of the CJTF were killed at the residence of humanitarian workers in Monguno, Borno state. During the attack, the insurgents reportedly abducted three employees of Damuli Investment Limited. The CJTF is a vigilante group created to support Nigerian troops in the fight against Boko Haram insurgency. The group has been operating in Borno, Yobe and Adamawa states.
