The Benue police command says its operatives have arrested one Ebube Jude, identified as a prisoner who escaped from the Kuje correctional facility in the federal capital territory (FCT). On July 5, gunmen attacked the Kuje correctional facility and freed over 900 inmates, including suspected members of Boko Haram. Sewuese Anene, spokesperson of the command, in a statement on Thursday, said the police received information on July 19 that a fugitive had arrived Makurdi, the Benue capital. According to her, detectives were deployed to investigate the matter and Jude was arrested at George Akume way in Makurdi. “During investigation, he confessed to have escaped from Kuje correctional centre during the jailbreak,” Anene said. “He stated further that he is an awaiting trial inmate, standing trial in a case of culpable homicide involving his girlfriend.” The police spokesperson added that the command had begun the process to hand him over to the Nigerian Correctional Service (NCoS) for necessary action. The development comes days after another escapee of the Kuje correctional facility was arrested by the Kaduna police command. Mohammed Jalige, spokesperson of the Kaduna police command, had said the suspect was arrested on his way to Kano.
