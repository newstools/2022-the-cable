The presidency says the issues relating to the ongoing strike by the Academic Staff Union of Universities (ASUU) can be resolved sooner if the stakeholders aren’t “unrealistically obstinate”. ASUU had embarked on strike on February 14 over the federal government’s failure to honour an agreement on issues relating to funding of universities, and lecturers’ salaries and allowances. TheCable had reported that after a meeting on Tuesday, Adamu Adamu, minister of education, was granted approval by the president to resolve issues of contention regarding the ASUU strike within two weeks. However, there were reports that the federal government had given the minister an ultimatum of two weeks to end the strike. In a statement on Wednesday by Garba Shehu, presidential spokesman, the presidency said the federal government hopes that the strike will end soon. He also clarified the decision taken at the Tuesday meeting, adding that the minister requested two to three weeks to reach an agreement with ASUU, adding that “the government is ready for business”. “Neither during nor after the meeting was any ultimatum given to the Minister of Education. During the meeting, the Minister of Education requested that the Minister of Labour hands off the negotiation to allow him lead and conclude what he had earlier on started with the Academic Staff Union of Universities (ASUU). And he promised that he could get an agreement within the shortest possible time, possibly two to three weeks,” the statement reads. “In carrying out this assignment, the Minister will carry along all relevant ministries and agencies with statutory functions and duties relating to the issues involved. “The Presidency is optimistic that agreements can be reached in an even shorter period if all parties/stakeholders are not unrealistically obstinate. We appeal to the parties to work together to end the strikes. “On the part of the administration, all doors remain open for dialogue and the resolution of the issues.”
