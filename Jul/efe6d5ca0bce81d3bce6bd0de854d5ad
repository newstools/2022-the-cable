Following the bonus row emanating from Super Falcons’ camp in Morocco, President Muhammadu Buhari has approved the funds as requested by the Nigeria Football Federation (NFF). Soon after the Falcons lost their semi-final game to host Morocco in the ongoing Women Africa Cup of Nations on Monday, the players threatened to boycott training until they were paid their outstanding bonuses. The cash-strapped NFF, however, passed the buck to the supervising sports ministry to offset what was owed the Falcons, creating tension in the sports sector in the process. Toyin Ibitoye, aide to Sunday Dare, the sports ministry, who confirmed the presidential approval for funds, said the ministry of finance had commenced the process on the funds’ release. “The money issues are being sorted as I speak with you and the Falcons will smile soonest,” Ibitoye said. The Falcons lost 5-4 in a penalty shootout to Morocco in the semi-final. The Nigerian ladies will meet fellow semi-final losers She-polopolo of Zambia in the third place match on Friday.
