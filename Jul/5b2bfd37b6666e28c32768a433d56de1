The Ogun police command says its operatives have arrested three persons for allegedly raping a 15-year-old girl and forcefully initiating her into a cult group in the state. Abimbola Oyeyemi, Ogun police spokesman, announced the development in a statement on Sunday. Oyeyemi said the suspects — identified as Daniel Njoku, Damilare Ogundiran, and Adebayo Olamilekan — were arrested after receiving a report lodged at the Ajuwon police divisional headquarters by the victim’s mother. According to NAN, the mother of the victim said she sent her 15-year-old daughter on an errand, after which one of the suspects forcefully took her to a hideout. The suspects reportedly threatened to kill the girl if she reported the incident to anyone. “Upon the report, the Divisional Police Officer, Ajuwon Division, SP Andrew Akinseye, detailed his detectives to go after the hoodlums,” the statement reads. “The team, acting on credible intelligence, located the hideout of the group at Akute Odo area, stormed the place and succeeded in arresting three members of the gang. “They confessed to the commission of the crime, and informed the police that they were desperately looking for more members to join their group, especially female members, and this prompted them to do what they did.” Lanre Bankole, commissioner of police in the state, has ordered the immediate transfer of the suspects to the anti-cult section of the state criminal investigation department (CID) for further investigation.
