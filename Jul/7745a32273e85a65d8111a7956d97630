The federal high court in the federal capital territory (FCT) has struck out a suit seeking to disqualify Adegboyega Oyetola, governor of Osun and All Progressives Congress (APC) candidate, from participating in the governorship election. The election is scheduled to be held on Saturday. Court throws out suit seeking to disqualify Oyetola from Osun governorship. The suit was filed by the faction of the party loyal to Rauf Aregbesola, minister of interior. Oyetola and Aregbesola have been at loggerheads over issues bordering on the party and governance. Moshood Adeoti, former secretary to the Osun government who is backed by the Aregbesola faction, went to court after Oyetola was declared winner of the governorship primary election. At the time, Adeoti asked the court to determine if Oyetola was eligible to contest owing to the fact that he was a member of the APC national caretaker committee. At the court on Thursday, Inyang Ekwo, the judge, held that Adeoti failed to support his suit “with the relevant laws”. The judge said the suit is not in line with section 87(9) of the electoral act and section 22 of the country’s constitution.
