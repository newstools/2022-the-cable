Uba Sani, governorship candidate of the All Progressives Congress (APC) in Kaduna, says there is no rift between Kashim Shettima, the party’s vice-presidential candidate, and Nasir el-Rufai, governor of Kaduna. Sani said this in reaction to the rumour that the two men are having a “cold war”. Speaking at an event in Kaduna on Friday, the senator described the rumour as “malicious”, saying the rumour mongers are ignorant of the cordial relationship Shettima and el-Rufai have. The governorship candidate said Shettima has the full support of the Kaduna governor. “I want to deliver a goodwill message from my brother, Governor Nasir Ahmed el-Rufai of Kaduna state,” he said. “I want to also say here that Governor El-Rufai has total support for our brother, His Excellency, Senator Kashim Shettima; we have worked together, we are brothers and we are friends.” According to him, Kaduna will give Bola Tinubu, APC presidential candidate, and Shettima the highest votes in the country. “I assure you, and stand to be quoted anywhere, anytime that Kaduna state would deliver the highest votes for the Tinubu presidency in 2023,” he said.
