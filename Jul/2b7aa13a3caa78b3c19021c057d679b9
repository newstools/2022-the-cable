Dana Airlines says it will come out stronger from the suspension of its operations by the aviation regulator. The Nigerian Civil Aviation Authority (NCAA) suspended Dana’s air transport licence (ATL) and air operator certificate (AOC) indefinitely on Wednesday. NCAA said it suspended the airline because of “its inability to meet its financial obligations and to conduct safe flights”. In a statement on Thursday, Dana Air said it “understands the impact this suspension will have on our partners, staff, passengers and the general public, but we are very confident that we would come out stronger as we have done in the past”. The airline said it would cooperate with the aviation authority in the course of the audit. “The recent skyrocketing cost of Jet A1 at 830/litre, unavailability of forex, and inflation are also contributory factors to this decision regrettably,” the statement reads. “We crave the understanding and patience of our customers, travel and business partners and sincerely apologise for any inconvenience our short absence from the market might cause. “Our customer service team will continue to operate 24/7 to assist affected customers with necessary information on refunds, adding that its offices will be open to all existing partners.”
