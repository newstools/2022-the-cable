Emmanuel Silas, the abducted priest of St Charles Catholic Church in Kauru LGA of Kaduna state, has regained freedom. Silas was abducted on Monday morning when gunmen invaded his rectory in Zambina area of the state. Emmanuel Okolo, chancellor of the Catholic Diocese of Kafanchan, confirmed Shekari’s release in a statement on Tuesday. “With hearts filled with joy, we raise our voices in a symphony of praises as we announce the return of our brother, Rev. Fr. Emmanuel Silas,” the statement reads. “He was abducted by armed persons from the parish rectory at St. Charles Catholic Church, Zambina, in Kauru Local Government Area, in the early hours of Monday, July 4th 2022.” Religious leaders have been routinely targeted by gunmen in the north-western state. The latest development comes days after gunmen killed Vitus Borogo, the chaplain of the Catholic Church in Kaduna Polytechnic. Borogo was killed when the assailants overran Prison Farm, Kujama, along Kaduna-Kachia road. Weeks before Borogo was killed, Joseph Bako, a Catholic priest who was abducted in March from his residence at St John Catholic Church, Kudenda, Kaduna, was found dead in April.
