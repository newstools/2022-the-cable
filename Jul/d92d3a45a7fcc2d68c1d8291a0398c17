The Kano state government has announced the ban of tricycle operations between 10pm and 6am. According to the state government, the directive will take effect on Thursday, July 21. Muhammad Garba, Kano commissioner of information, announced the decision in a statement released on Monday. The commissioner said the decision was reached at the end of the state security meeting. “Kano state government has announced a ban on the operations of tricycles popularly known as Adaidata Sahu from 10:00pm-6:00am with effect from Thursday, July 21, 2022,” the statement reads. “A statement issued by the commissioner for Information, Malam Muhammad Garba indicated that decision to that effect was reached at the end of the state security meeting. “He said the measure was part of effort to ensure security of lives and property in the state. “The commissioner, in the statement, urged tricycle riders to comply and stop operating at the stipulated hours as security agents would enforce the ban without compromise.” Tricycle operators in the state have historically been at loggerheads with the government over levied payment. In February 2021, they declared a three-day strike to protest the N100 daily tax imposed by the state government. But the strike ended after the intervention of the Nigerian Labour Congress (NLC). In January 2022, TheCable reported that tricycle operators in the state had declared a seven-day strike to protest the registration levy imposed by the Kano Road Traffic Agency (KAROTA). Two days later, the tricycle operators suspended their strike.
