A high court sitting in Birnin Kebbi, the Kebbi capital, has convicted one Suleiman Idris, a citizen of Niger Republic, to death by hanging. Idris was found guilty of killing a mother and her daughter — Sa’adiya Idris and Khadija Alkali. The incident was said to have occurred in April at Alabama quarters in Birnin Kebbi. The suspect had reportedly confessed to using a cutlass to hit Sa’adiya until she was dead. He also said he killed the woman’s daughter, Khadija, to cover up his crime. Idris said he committed the crime because Sa’adiya had call him an “animal”. In his ruling on Friday, Suleiman Ambursa, the presiding judge, said the defendant was arraigned on a two-count charge of homicide, punishable by death under sections 191(a) and (b) of the Kebbi State Penal Code 2021. Ambursa found the defendant guilty, after he pleaded guilty to the crime, and sentenced him to death by hanging. On his part, Suleiman Alkali, the defendant’s counsel, said the law had made a provision for appeal, adding that he has not yet decided on the next line of action.
