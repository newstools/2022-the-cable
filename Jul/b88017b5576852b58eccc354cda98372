Ike and Beatrice Ekweremadu have arrived at the Westminster magistrate court for their trial. Their arrival in the courtroom comes two hours after the proceeding was scheduled to commence. The former deputy senate president and his wife are facing charges bordering on conspiracy to arrange/facilitate the travel of another person with a view to exploitation, namely organ harvesting. Spotted at the court on Thursday is Adamu Bulkachuwa, chairman of the senate committee on foreign affairs. David Mark, former president of the senate; Chukwuemeka Nwajiuba, former minister of state for education, and a delegation from the Nigeria high commission, were also present in court. The former deputy senate president and his wife were recently arrested for allegedly bringing a child to the UK for organ harvesting. They were subsequently remanded in custody. According to a letter seen by TheCable, Ekweremadu had written to the UK high commission to support the visa application of a “kidney donor” for his daughter Sonia. Although the UK police said the donor was 15, David Nwamini Ukpo — as the alleged donor was later identified — was listed as 21 years old on his international passport and the Bank Verification Number (BVN) portal. A court has since ordered the Nigerian authorities to release the biodata of the said organ donor. The biodata will form part of Ekweremadu’s defence at the Westminster magistrate court.
