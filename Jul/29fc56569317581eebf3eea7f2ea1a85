Samuel Kanu-Uche, prelate of the Methodist Church Nigeria (MCN), says he will only support a presidential candidate who doesn’t engage in vote-buying. He spoke on Friday in Enugu at the graduation ceremony of 160 members of the church from the Enugu diocese, who were trained on various vocational skills. The prelate advised Nigerians against selling their votes, adding that politicians who engage in vote-buying have nothing to offer in terms of service to the nation. He, however, did not name which candidate he would support for the presidency. “I know that most of the candidates has nothing to offer, but any presidential candidate that shares money will not receive my vote,” NAN quoted him as saying. “Only those who have no money to share but offer themselves for service will get my vote.” Addressing the graduands, especially the women, he urged them to use their skills to contribute meaningfully to societal growth and national development. “Our women are known for being industrious and never relied on their husbands or go after men. Rather, they use their sweat to help their husbands,” he said. “I believe the training you received today will add value to your family. I would not have gone to college if not for my mother who stood by her husband. “She never knew she was training a prelate of Methodist Church Nigeria. So, do not leave here today to go and relax.” The participants benefitted from a free training programme organised by the Potters Wheel Foundation (PWF), Enugu, which is owned and managed by Godsown Onuzulike and his wife, Chinwe. The prelate commended the organisers for training church members free of charge, and prayed for God’s blessing upon the family.
