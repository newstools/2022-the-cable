Obinna Obeta, a doctor residing in Southwark, south London, has been charged with plotting with Ike Ekweremadu and Beatrice, his wife, to traffic a man into the UK to harvest a kidney for their daughter. According to Daily Mail, Obeta appeared before Bexley Magistrates’ court on July 13 and is charged under the modern slavery act with arranging the travel of a 21-year-old man between August 2021 and May 2022 with a view to exploit him. A second charge alleges he conspired with the Ekweremadus to facilitate the travel of the man with a view to exploit him by harvesting his organ. Ekweremadu, former deputy senate president, and his wife are facing charges bordering on conspiracy to arrange/facilitate the travel of another person with a view to exploitation, namely organ harvesting. According to a letter seen by TheCable, Ekweremadu had written to the UK high commission to support the visa application of a “kidney donor” for his daughter, Sonia. The prosecutor had insisted that David Ukpo, the donor, was a minor, though he was listed as 21 years old on his passport and the Bank Verification Number (BVN) portal. A court had ordered the Nigerian authorities to release the biodata of the said organ donor to form part of Ekweremadu’s defence at the Westminster magistrates’ court. The Westminster magistrates’ court in the UK ruled that Ukpo is not a minor after the counsel to the Ekweremadus made an argument on the matter. The defendants’ lawyers informed the court of a bail application they intend to file in the first week of August. All three defendants, who are in custody, are due to appear at the Old Bailey on August 4.
