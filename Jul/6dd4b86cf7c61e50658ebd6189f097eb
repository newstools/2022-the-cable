Bola Tinubu, presidential candidate of the All Progressives Congress (APC), has returned to Nigeria after days in France. Tinubu had, on June 27, left Nigeria for France, and according to a statement by Tunde Rahman, his media aide, the trip was for “important meetings”. Tinubu, who left France on Friday, announced his arrival in Nigeria on his social media handles in the early hours of Saturday. He also shared photos of himself with the caption: “Grateful to Almighty Allah for journey mercies. Glad to be home and looking forward to what is ahead. Eid Mubarak.” Grateful to Almighty Allah for journey mercies. Glad to be home and looking forward to what is ahead. Eid Mubarak.#BAT23 pic.twitter.com/pG8gu9fs0T — Bola Ahmed Tinubu (@officialABAT) July 9, 2022  While in France, Femi Otedola, billionaire businessman, as well as Dapo Abiodun, governor of Ogun, visited him. Otedola, who tweeted a photograph of his visit to the APC presidential candidate, referred to him as a “great friend” and wished him success in the 2023 general election. Also, during his time in France, there were speculations that the APC presidential candidate met with Nyesom Wike, governor of Rivers and a member of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP), on the 2023 elections. However, his media office had denied the claim, saying although Tinubu holds Wike “in high esteem”, no meeting of the sort held in France. Meanwhile, earlier on Friday, three APC governors — Rotimi Akeredolu of Ondo, Kayode Fayemi of Ekiti, and Babajide Sanwo-Olu of Lagos — held a closed-door meeting with the Rivers governor at the latter’s Port Harcourt residence. Details of what was discussed at the meeting are not yet clear, but the development comes amid speculations that Wike may defect from the PDP following his loss of the presidential and vice-presidential tickets. Now that he has returned to the country, Tinubu is expected to announce the name of his running mate for the 2023 elections. Kabir Masari, former APC welfare secretary, is currently the APC’s “placeholder” vice-presidential candidate. Below are photos of Tinubu following his arrival in Nigeria. <img class="aligncenter wp-image-722241" src="https://f5p3e9e4.stackpathcdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/IMG-20220709-WA0002-1024x684.jpg" alt="" width="550" height="367" srcset="https://f5p3e9e4.stackpathcdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/IMG-20220709-WA0002-1024x684.jpg 1024w, https://f5p3e9e4.stackpathcdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/IMG-20220709-WA0002-300x200.jpg 300w, https://f5p3e9e4.stackpathcdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/IMG-20220709-WA0002-768x513.jpg 768w, https://f5p3e9e4.stackpathcdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/IMG-20220709-WA0002-24x16.jpg 24w, https://f5p3e9e4.stackpathcdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/IMG-20220709-WA0002-36x24.jpg 36w, https://f5p3e9e4.stackpathcdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/IMG-20220709-WA0002-48x32.jpg 48w, https://f5p3e9e4.stackpathcdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/IMG-20220709-WA0002.jpg 1440w" sizes="(max-width: 550px) 100vw, 550px" /> <img class="aligncenter wp-image-722243" src="https://f5p3e9e4.stackpathcdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/IMG-20220709-WA0001-1024x683.jpg" alt="" width="550" height="367" srcset="https://f5p3e9e4.stackpathcdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/IMG-20220709-WA0001-1024x683.jpg 1024w, https://f5p3e9e4.stackpathcdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/IMG-20220709-WA0001-300x200.jpg 300w, https://f5p3e9e4.stackpathcdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/IMG-20220709-WA0001-768x512.jpg 768w, https://f5p3e9e4.stackpathcdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/IMG-20220709-WA0001-24x16.jpg 24w, https://f5p3e9e4.stackpathcdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/IMG-20220709-WA0001-36x24.jpg 36w, https://f5p3e9e4.stackpathcdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/IMG-20220709-WA0001-48x32.jpg 48w, https://f5p3e9e4.stackpathcdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/IMG-20220709-WA0001.jpg 1440w" sizes="(max-width: 550px) 100vw, 550px" /> <img class="aligncenter wp-image-722242" src="https://f5p3e9e4.stackpathcdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/IMG-20220709-WA0003-1024x683.jpg" alt="" width="550" height="367" srcset="https://f5p3e9e4.stackpathcdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/IMG-20220709-WA0003-1024x683.jpg 1024w, https://f5p3e9e4.stackpathcdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/IMG-20220709-WA0003-300x200.jpg 300w, https://f5p3e9e4.stackpathcdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/IMG-20220709-WA0003-768x512.jpg 768w, https://f5p3e9e4.stackpathcdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/IMG-20220709-WA0003-24x16.jpg 24w, https://f5p3e9e4.stackpathcdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/IMG-20220709-WA0003-36x24.jpg 36w, https://f5p3e9e4.stackpathcdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/IMG-20220709-WA0003-48x32.jpg 48w, https://f5p3e9e4.stackpathcdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/IMG-20220709-WA0003.jpg 1440w" sizes="(max-width: 550px) 100vw, 550px" /> <img class="aligncenter wp-image-722244" src="https://f5p3e9e4.stackpathcdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/IMG-20220709-WA0000-1024x683.jpg" alt="" width="550" height="367" srcset="https://f5p3e9e4.stackpathcdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/IMG-20220709-WA0000-1024x683.jpg 1024w, https://f5p3e9e4.stackpathcdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/IMG-20220709-WA0000-300x200.jpg 300w, https://f5p3e9e4.stackpathcdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/IMG-20220709-WA0000-768x513.jpg 768w, https://f5p3e9e4.stackpathcdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/IMG-20220709-WA0000-24x16.jpg 24w, https://f5p3e9e4.stackpathcdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/IMG-20220709-WA0000-36x24.jpg 36w, https://f5p3e9e4.stackpathcdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/IMG-20220709-WA0000-48x32.jpg 48w, https://f5p3e9e4.stackpathcdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/IMG-20220709-WA0000.jpg 1440w" sizes="(max-width: 550px) 100vw, 550px" /> <img class="aligncenter wp-image-722246" src="https://f5p3e9e4.stackpathcdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/IMG-20220709-WA0004.jpg" alt="" width="550" height="367" srcset="https://f5p3e9e4.stackpathcdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/IMG-20220709-WA0004.jpg 720w, https://f5p3e9e4.stackpathcdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/IMG-20220709-WA0004-300x200.jpg 300w, https://f5p3e9e4.stackpathcdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/IMG-20220709-WA0004-24x16.jpg 24w, https://f5p3e9e4.stackpathcdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/IMG-20220709-WA0004-36x24.jpg 36w, https://f5p3e9e4.stackpathcdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/IMG-20220709-WA0004-48x32.jpg 48w" sizes="(max-width: 550px) 100vw, 550px" />
