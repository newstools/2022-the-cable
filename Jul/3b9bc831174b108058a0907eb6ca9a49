Sunday Dare, minister of youth and sports, has hailed Tobi Amusan and Ese Brume for their achievements at the World Athletics Championships in Oregon, United States. Amusan broke the hurdles record in the semi-finals in 12.12s and followed up with a (+2.5) wind-assisted 12.06s in the final in the early hours of Monday. She also won the 100m hurdles gold. Brume, on the other hand, leapt 7.2m to win a silver medal in the long jump. “I am so proud of what Tobi, Ese Brume and even those who didn’t get on the podium have achieved in Eugene, Oregon. It’s a new dawn for Nigerian athletics,” Dare said in a statement on Monday. “The 4×100m relay teams (men and women) showed a lot of promise for the future. Our athletes in the short sprints also showed character, even though some of them competed on a high level stage like this for the first time.” The focus would now shift to the Commonwealth Games which will commence later this week in Birmingham, the United Kingdom where Nigeria will compete in nine sports.
