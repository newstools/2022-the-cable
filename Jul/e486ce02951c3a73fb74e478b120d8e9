Afenifere, a pan Yoruba socio-political organisation, says President Muhammadu Buhari’s directives to the Nigerian Army to take firm action against insurgents is not backed by action. The group said this on Sunday in a statement signed by Jare Ajayi, national publicity secretary, Afenifere. According to Afenifere, insurgency should have been effectively addressed if government had lived up to its responsibility on securing the nation’s territories. “President Buhari’s directive to the army to confront terrorists and insurgents and wipe them off the face of the earth is a repetition of order that has been given so often that it no longer evokes substance because it was not backed up with necessary wherewithal,” the statement reads. “Insurgency ought not to have occurred at all in the first place were the government had been up to its responsibility. And since it began, the kid-glove treatment being meted out to the terrorists was what made them to grow to the point of taking over territories in some states in the northern part of the country. “While we appreciate the president’s affirmation to give the military needed support, we note that this has been said several times over without backing it up with action. “It is on record that men of the armed forces had at different times complained that they do not have the kind of fire-power possessed by the terrorists they were supposed to confront and overcome.” Afenifere said it will continue to put pressure on the federal government until security improves. “The position that Afenifere has always been pushing on security, to wit: state and community policing system must be allowed with all the necessary powers, while the national security agencies are equipped, motivated and mobilised adequately in a manner that would make them tower above the enemies they are supposed to confront,” the group added.
