The African Union (AU) has launched a digital platform designed to ease the implementation of the African Continental Free Trade Area (AfCFTA). The digital platform — www.afcfta.app — was unveiled at an event held recently and convened by the AU and AfroChampions. The event, tagged ‘Boma of Africa’, was themed; ‘Taking stock of the African century’. AfCFTA is a free-trade area agreement signed by most African countries. It is a flagship project of the AU’s agenda 2063. The agreement aims at creating “a single market for goods, services, facilitated by movement of persons in order to deepen the economic integration of the African continent.” Commenting on the essence of the digital platform, AU, in a statement, said “the digital platform, called the AfCFTA Hub, interconnects national, regional and private digital applications together to boost the ability of SMEs to expand their business and/or export their products across Africa through improved logistics, networking of retail outlets, integration of fintech’s and brand development support.” Meanwhile, during the event, the AU also launched a digital vaccine passport platform that allows AU citizens to acquire free digital proof of their vaccinations, which can be verified anywhere in the world. “The African vaccine passport allows every African Union citizen to acquire a free digital proof of their vaccinations that can be verified around the world utilising the PanaBIOS (www.panabios.org) and UNDP-backed Global Haven (www.globalhaven.org) mechanisms,” AU said.
