The ministry of youth and sports development says it has implemented a zero-tolerance policy on out-of-competition testings for Nigerian athletes. In a statement on Wednesday, the ministry said the implementation was in preparation for the 2022 World Athletics Championship in Oregon and Commonwealth Games in Birmingham. It said the development came after the incidents at the 2020 Tokyo Olympic Games involving non-compliance on testing. The ministry said it is moving in tandem with recommendations of the national assembly that athletes who do not complete their mandatory tests within three weeks before international competitions should not be allowed to represent Nigeria. “The Ministry will not in anyway want to put the name of the country in the mud in Oregon or ridicule Nigeria in Birmingham and it is in line with this that we ensured compliance with all laws, principles and regulations that guide testing of athletes,” said Simon Enhojiaye, the director of federations and elite athletes department in the ministry. The World Athletics Championships get underway this weekend in Eugene, Oregon in the United States while the Commonwealth Games will hold in Birmingham from July 28 to August 8.
