An Ikeja domestic violence and sexual offences court, on Thursday, sentenced a Lagos resident to life imprisonment for defiling his three daughters. The daughters were said to be aged 10, 20, and 24, respectively. According to NAN, Abiola Soladoye, the judge, held that prosecution proved the case of defilement and rape brought against the defendant, beyond reasonable doubt. “Evidence before the court shows that the prosecution has proved the case of defilement and rape before this court,” the judge said. “The defendant, who is the father of the three daughters, is found guilty as charged, as the burden of proof has been discharged. “This is a very sad case. It is a disgrace to parenthood. “The defendant ravished his own daughters in turn, committing incest. It is rather shameful and most perverted. “The defendant is hereby found guilty and sentenced to life imprisonment on count one. “On count two, he is sentenced to life imprisonment and on count three, he is also sentenced to life imprisonment.” Soladoye added that the sentence would run concurrently, and ordered that the convict should have his name written in the Lagos state sexual offenders register.
