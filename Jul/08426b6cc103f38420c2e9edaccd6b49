Ndifreke Nkanta has narrated how four of his children died in a mudslide in Calabar, the Cross River capital. According to Nkanta, who is physically challenged, the mudslide which occurred in the early hours of Sunday, caused his house to collapse on his children aged between nine months and 15 years. The 38-year-old said his other two children sustained various degrees of injuries and were admitted in hospital. He said several other houses were also affected by the landslide. “The tragic incident happened on Sunday evening after a heavy downpour which brought down many houses in the area,” NAN quoted him as saying. “I have lost four of my six children who were in the house that collapsed on them as a result of the mudslide. “They were eating when the house collapsed on them and swept them away. My remaining two kids are in critical condition in the hospital. “I did not take even a spoon from the house when the flood swept it away; my phone, everything is gone, including my four children. “As I speak with you, I’m homeless, with nowhere to go. There is no money to even pay the hospital bills for the surviving two. I have nowhere to live anymore. “I’m just a petty trader, with no other means of survival. I need help from the general public to help my remaining children who are still in the hospital.” Nkanta called on Cross River State Emergency Management Agency (SEMA) and other relevant government agencies to come to his aid.
