Sunday Dare, minister of youth and sports development, has hailed the gallantry of the Super Falcons in their semi-final defeat to Morocco at the 2022 African Women Cup of Nations (WAFCON). The nine-time WAFCON champions lost 5-4 on penalties to the host country on Monday night as the game ended 1-1 after extra time. The Falcons hopes of winning the competition for the 10th time suffered a setback when Halimatu Ayinde and Rasheedat Ajibade were sent off. In a statement on Tuesday, Dare lauded the resilience and character displayed by the team. According to him, the game was symptomatic of the “never say die attitude of true Nigerians.” “Your resilience, character and management of the game must be commended. You held the Moroccans in front of over 45,000 capacity crowd in the never say die attitude of true Nigerians, despite down to nine players,” Dare said. “I followed the match very keenly and I am so proud of your display throughout”. The Falcons will meet the She-polopolo of Zambia on Friday in the third place match of the tournament. The Atlas Lionesses and South Africa will also slug it out at the final of this year’s edition of the tournament. This will be Morocco’s first-ever appearance in the final of the competition.
