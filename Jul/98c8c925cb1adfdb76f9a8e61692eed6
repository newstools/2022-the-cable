CBD MediaEdge Communications Ltd, a US-based media company, says it will partner with the National Bureau of Statistics (NBS) on simplifying data. Adeyemi Adeniran, NBS director-general who is also the atatistician-general of the federation, spoke on the development during a visit by Akogun Ajibola, chairman of CBD MediaEdge Communications, and his team on July 21. According to Ajibola, opinion poll surveys and public enlightenment programmes would be part of measures taken. He also said the partnership is to promote a better understanding of data information released by the NBS every quarter, which impacts the lives of ordinary Nigerians. “In this undertaking, the media company will play a significant role in simplifying statistical data in storytelling expression, rather than in raw figures that may not be interesting to read — a sort of ‘boil it down’ interpretation engagement to the public,” he said. “It will also enable the media company to expand its reach to nationwide respondents on its regular polls and surveys, especially now that NBS assigns questionnaires only through the digital space.” In his remarks, Adeniran commended CBD MediaEdge Communication Ltd for the initiative and directed the appropriate directorate to adopt a memorandum of understanding (MoU) with the media firm without further delay.
