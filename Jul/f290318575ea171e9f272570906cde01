The Kaduna police command says its operatives have re-arrested a suspected Kuje prison escapee. On July 5, 2022, terrorists attacked the Kuje prison in the federal capital territory (FCT), freeing over 900 inmates, including suspected members of the Boko Haram insurgents. Mohammed Jalige, spokesperson of the Kaduna police command, said the suspect was arrested in the state on Sunday while in transit to Kano. Jalije said Yekini Ayoku, commissioner of police, had earlier ordered all tactical commanders and divisional police officers to mount surveillance across the state. He said the 60-year-old suspect, identified as Shuaibu, is an indigene of Kano state. “As instructed by Inspector-General of Police Alkali Usman the operatives, without prejudice to existing crime prevention measures, responded effectively which started yielding a positive result with the re-arrest of a suspected escapee on July 17,” he said. “The suspect on preliminary investigation revealed that he was part of the inmates who escaped during the recent attack on the Kuje medium security correctional centre.” The police spokesperson said the commissioner had directed that necessary protocol be carried out before handing the suspect over to the Nigerian Correctional Service (NCoS) for proper placement. The suspect is the latest Kuje prison escapee to be arrested by the police.
