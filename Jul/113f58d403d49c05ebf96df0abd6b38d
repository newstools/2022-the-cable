Babachir Lawal, former secretary to the government of the federation (SGF), says fielding two Muslims as presidential and vice-presidential candidates of the All Progressives Congress (APC) will cause division. Lawal said this on Thursday during an interview with ARISE TV. On July 10, Bola Tinubu, APC presidential candidate, announced Kashim Shettima, former governor of Borno, as his running mate for the 2023 election. Speaking on the development, Lawal said the APC cannot say there are no competent Christians in the north that could have been chosen as running mate. “First of all, nobody should aspire to be president of this country if he knows there will be religious dichotomy in the system,” the former SGF said. “You will antagonise the Christian majority in this country. It’s a direct attack on them and even in your own zone, because when it comes to religion, Nigerians take religion first. “Now, you jeoperdise the whole of the Christians in the north, in the south-south, in the south-east. “If it is based on competence, Tinubu, who has one degree in business administration, cannot beat professor Osinbajo. So, competence in what? Who examines this competence? Is it an exam? “So, in any case, maybe given that Shettima is the most competent person from the north, which exam did he take? “Islam preaches justice. Why can’t they see this? No Muslim would want to live in acrimonious relationship with his neighbour. “See, me, B.D. Lawal, a Christian, APC chieftain, a friend of Bola Tinubu, how will I go to Adamawa and stay on the podium and say vote for Bola and his Muslim-Muslim ticket?”
