We discovered the image was taken from Ilorin in Kwara state and not Osun as claimed. Further research revealed that the photo, taken at the Eid-el Kabir prayer held in Kwara state, was first uploaded on July 9. The photo was posted on the verified Twitter handle of the Kwara state government, with the caption: “Worshippers in Ilorin, the Kwara State capital, on Saturday turned out en masse to observe the Eid-el Kabir prayer, with Governor @RealAARahman clearly setting the ground for a peaceful atmosphere with his open exchange of pleasantries with leading opposition figures #EidMubarak.” Checks by TheCable also revealed that a Twitter user had shared different photos from the recent Eid-el Kabir prayer held in Ilorin, further confirming that the photo was not from the PDP rally in Osun. The Durbar festival is a yearly occurrence in the city, as well as in few states in the country. It is a very colorful event that showcases the culture of the Ilorin people in all of their elements.
