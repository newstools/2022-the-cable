Inuwa Yahaya, governor of Gombe, says Nigerians should focus on the achievements that leaders can bring rather than on their religion. Yahaya said this while speaking on the Muslim-Muslim ticket by the All Progressives Congress (APC) in an interview published by BBC Hausa on Saturday. The governor said leadership affects everyone irrespective of religion or tribe. On July 10, Kashim Shettima, former governor of Borno state, was announced as the running mate of Bola Tinubu, presidential candidate of the APC, for the 2023 elections. “There are a lot of things to consider before picking a running mate,” Yahaya said. “What I know is politics itself and running an administration are guided by laws. “The law permits it; in fact the law didn’t even mention religion in this matter, and what I believe is that the people should understand that whoever will be fair, just and is visionary who can look back and identify good people to form a team with in order to achieve success is someone who should be of concern to us not religion. “If you say it’s about Christians or Muslims only, what about traditional worshippers or those who don’t even have a religion; they also exist in Nigeria. “What we want is to win the election and form an administration that will rule with fairness, justice, a government that will make a poor Nigerian live a life without hardship and in peace. “What we are after is the success of the APC.”
