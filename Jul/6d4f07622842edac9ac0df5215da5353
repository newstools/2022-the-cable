Saturday’s governorship election in Osun state is significant on many fronts — it is the last major election before the 2023 presidential poll and is a sort of dress rehearsal for the presidential race between the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) and All Progressives Congress (APC). The major presidential candidates, including Peter Obi of the Labour Party (LP), were all in the state to campaign for their parties’ flagbearers. In all, 15 candidates were cleared by the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) for the election but Gboyega Oyetola (APC), Ademola Adeleke (PDP), Lasun Yusuf (LP) and Akin Ogunbiyi Accord Party (AP) are the standout contenders. Will Oyetola retain his position by securing a second term? Will Adeleke be second time lucky — having lost narrowly and controversially to Oyetola in 2018? Will Yusuf hurt, or even upstage, APC? Will Ogunbiyi be the outsider that caused an upset? Follow TheCable as our team of reporters will provide blow-by-blow reporting LIVE — in text, video, audio and photo.
