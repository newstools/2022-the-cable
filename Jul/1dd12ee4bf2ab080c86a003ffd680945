The Islamic State in West Africa Province (ISWAP) has reportedly claimed responsibility for the attack on a correctional facility in Kuje council area of the federal capital territory (FCT). On Tuesday night, gunmen attacked the correctional facility, with over 500 prisoners — including all Boko Haram suspects — said to have escaped. Four inmates have been confirmed dead, while an officer of the Nigeria Security and Civil Defence Coops (NSCDC) was also killed in the attack. A video, said to have been published on Wednesday by the Islamic State A’maq agency, shows what appears to be a view of the Kuje prison while gunshots are heard in the background. The video also shows writing in Arabic, which, when translated, has ISWAP saying its members organised the attack. “A video clip obtained by Amaq shows the first moments of the liberation of prisoners after Islamic State fighters stormed Kuje prison yesterday in Nigeria,” it reads. According to Tomasz Rolbecki, a researcher who analyses activities of insurgents in sub-Saharan Africa, ISWAP said the attack resulted in its fighters “freeing dozens of prisoners”. #BREAKING: ISWAP has just claimed responsibility for the Kuje prison break, saying it had succeeded in “freeing dozens of prisoners”. pic.twitter.com/3wliA3OEwg — Tomasz Rolbiecki (@TomaszRolbiecki) July 6, 2022  Meanwhile, President Muhammadu Buhari has described the attack as “shocking”, and said he is disappointed with the intelligence gathering capacity of security agencies. “I am disappointed with the intelligence system. How can terrorists organize, have weapons, attack a security installation and get away with it? I am expecting a comprehensive report on this shocking incident,” he said during a visit to the facility on Wednesday.
