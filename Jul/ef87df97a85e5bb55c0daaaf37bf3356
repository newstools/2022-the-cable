Rabiu Kwankwaso, presidential candidate of the New Nigeria Peoples Party (NNPP), says if he feels he won’t stand a chance in the 2023 general election, he would recommend Bola Tinubu. Kwankwaso said this on Sunday, in an interview with ARISE TV. According to the former Kano governor, he doesn’t feel threatened by Tinubu, who is the presidential candidate of the All Progressives Congress (APC). He, however, added that he has reservations about if the APC presidential candidate will campaign based on the party’s current performance. “I hope he will take it easy so that we can continue with the struggle to ensure one solid and prosperous Nigeria. I’m so happy about that combination. My only worry is the platform,” he said. “I know he is a strategist — Bola Tinubu — he is a good man. I had reasons to sit down with him uncountable number of times from 1992 to date. “I wish I will see him to ask him what he will tell Nigerians that he will do differently from what Muhammadu Buhari is doing today. “That is my serious concern for him. Ordinarily, if I cannot get it, I can recommend him, but it’s going to be like building something on zero. “When I see him, I’ll wish him well or when you see him before me, tell him I wish him well, but let’s take it easy.” On the Muslim-Muslim ticket of the APC, Kwankwaso said he wouldn’t advise such considering Nigerias current realities. “We all know that is not the best arrangement, and it is just a matter of time that they will realise the mistake of doing it,” he said.
