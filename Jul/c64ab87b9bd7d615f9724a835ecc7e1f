Uche Secondus, former national chairman of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP), has praised the leadership qualities of Peter Obi, presidential candidate of the Labour Party (LP). Secondus said Obi’s leadership prowess demonstrated while serving as the governor of Anambra state sets him apart as a “generational leader”. The former PDP chairman said this while congratulating Obi who turned 61 on Tuesday. According to a statement issued by Ike Abonyi, his spokesperson, Secondus commended Obi for the “unique and positive style he has brought into the nation’s public life”. “Your frugal attitude to public fund is worthy of emulation, especially for a struggling country like ours,” Secondus was quoted as saying. Secondus said Obi’s strength of character and reputation brought into the nation’s polity has added enormous value to the country. In May, Obi resigned his membership of the PDP before the party’s presidential primary election. The former Anambra governor joined the LP and won the ticket of the party.
