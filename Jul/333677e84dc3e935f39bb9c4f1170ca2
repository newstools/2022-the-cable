A federal high court in Kano has vacated an order that restrained the Kano state government from borrowing N10 billion to install closed-circuit television (CCTV) cameras. The Kano house of assembly had, on June 15, approved a request by Abdullahi Ganduje, governor of the state, to obtain the N10 billion loan. The request was contained in a letter dated March 18, 2022, which the governor sent to the assembly. The governor said the loan is to fund a CCTV camera project in the Kano metropolis. But the Kano First Forum (KFF), a coalition of NGOs, filed a suit to stop the governor from borrowing the money on the grounds of non-compliance with rules and regulations governing loan transactions. On July 1, Abdullahi Liman, the presiding judge, granted the prayers in the ex parte application and ordered all parties in the suit to maintain status quo. However, at the court session on Tuesday, Muhammad Dahuru, counsel to the state government, moved an application urging the court to discharge and set aside the earlier order it granted against his client. Delivering his ruling, Liman vacated his previous order on the grounds that the plaintiff had concealed and misrepresented facts. He also transferred the suit to the vacation judge for continuation, as the court will begin its annual vacation on Friday.
