Murtala Ajaka, deputy spokesman of the All Progressives Congress (APC), has mourned the passing of Kemi Nelson, a former women leader of the party. Nelson reportedly died on Sunday after a protracted illness. She was 66. In a statement on Sunday, Ajaka said the former women leader fought for the emancipation of women and youths and was passionate about justice. “In 1999, she joined Alliance for Democracy (AD) and from 1999 to 2003, she served as the Lagos State Commissioner for Women Affairs and Poverty Alleviation during the tenure of Bola Ahmed Tinubu and has served as the Women Leader of Lagos State Chapter of APC and was later made the South West Women Leader of APC,” he said. “She was the only female serving member of the Lagos state Governor’s Advisory Council (GAC). “Mrs Kemi Nelson was a tireless advocate of women and youth emancipation. She stood for all those in the world of politics who are unable to realise their potential. “In all situations, whether on the public stage or away from the cameras, she has passion for justice, and her deep desire for a better, fairer world for women in politics shone through, and by her attitude. “She has proven beyond doubt that women could play a great role in governance and can make a difference.” Ajaka said her “tireless efforts” earned her the APC women leader position, not just in Lagos state but the entire south-west.
