Daniel Bwala, special adviser to the deputy senate president on legal matters, has resigned his membership of the All Progressives Congress (APC). Bwala said his decision is based on “principles and conviction”, adding that his resignation is effective Sunday, July 10. The lawyer said all efforts in the country should “gravitate towards uniting our people”. He wrote: “Tonight I officially resigned my membership of @OfficialAPCNg on principles and conviction that I hold so dear. At this time of our national existence, our efforts and energy should gravitate towards uniting our people.” Tonight I officially resigned my membership of @OfficialAPCNg  on principles and conviction that I hold so dear. At this time of our national existence, our efforts amd energy  should gravitate towards uniting our people — D. H Bwala (@BwalaDaniel) July 10, 2022  In a previous tweet, Bwala had commented on the selection of Kashim Shettima, former Borno governor, as the running mate of Bola Tinubu, presidential candidate of the APC. Bwala described the Muslim-Muslim ticket as an “interesting” development in the now-deleted tweet. <img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-722834" src="https://f5p3e9e4.stackpathcdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/Bwala.png" alt="" width="728" height="453" srcset="https://f5p3e9e4.stackpathcdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/Bwala.png 728w, https://f5p3e9e4.stackpathcdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/Bwala-300x187.png 300w, https://f5p3e9e4.stackpathcdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/Bwala-24x15.png 24w, https://f5p3e9e4.stackpathcdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/Bwala-36x22.png 36w, https://f5p3e9e4.stackpathcdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/Bwala-48x30.png 48w" sizes="(max-width: 728px) 100vw, 728px" /> Speaking on his decision to opt for the controversial same religion ticket, Tinubu had said his selection of a running mate is beyond religion and ethnicity. The former Lagos governor said what mattered the most was “competence in governance”. He said the ticket “represents a milestone in Nigeria’s political history” — just as it was when MKO Abiola, candidate of the Social Democratic Party (SDP), chose Babagana Kingibe, a fellow Muslim, as his running mate in 1993. “In 1993, Nigerians embrace Chief MKO Abiola and a fellow Muslim running mate, Baba Gana Kingibe in one of our fairest elections ever held. The spirit of 1993 is upon us again in 2023,” Tinubu said. “As such, the ticket we present today represents a milestone in our political history. It symbolizes our party’s determination to be a leading light among political parties in Africa.” Babagana Zulum, Borno governor and successor of Shettima, has described Tinubu’s decision as the “wisest choice”. Criticism has however been pouring in from several quarters, with the Middle Belt Forum calling the APC “insensitive” and noting that Nigerians will “defeat” the ticket. On its part, the Christian Association of Nigeria (CAN) said “it is up to Nigerians to accept or reject” the APC, adding that “today’s Nigeria is not the same as when Nigerians voted Abiola-Kingibe ticket which was eventually annulled”. The APC has also been getting a lot of flak on social media, with several influential voices condemning the development. Aisha Yesufu, activist and co-convener of Bring Back Our Girls (BBOG), said the Muslim-Muslim ticket is an “insult to fairness, justice and equity”. A Muslim-Muslim ticket is an insult to fairness, equity and justice. It is see finish. It is impunity of the worst kind.It is disrespect to people of the federal Republic of Nigeria. It shows they have little regards for people and think their structure is more valuable. — Aisha Yesufu (@AishaYesufu) July 10, 2022
