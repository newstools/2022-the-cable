Faruk Yahaya, chief of army staff (COAS), says soldiers are on the trail of the gunmen who carried out a recent attack on Shiroro LGA of Niger state. Yahaya spoke on Friday while addressing journalists at the Mogadishu cantonment, during the Juma’at service in commemoration of the Nigerian Army day celebration in Abuja. On Wednesday, four Chinese and several Nigerian workers were abducted by gunmen at a mining site in Ajata Aboki village in Shiroro LGA. Several soldiers mobilised to the area sustained injuries, while a yet-to-be-confirmed number of military officers were killed in the attack. Speaking on the incident, the army chief said the armed forces are not deterred by the challenges created by criminals across the country. He vowed that the perpetrators of the Shiroro attack, as well as gunmen in other parts of the country, will face justice. “We have had our challenges. Recently, in Niger, we had one but we are addressing them. We are not deterred by any challenge from all those criminals,” he said. “As we speak, we are on their trail and we will, and I say we will, get those criminals in Niger and other areas throughout the country.” Commending the role played by the armed forces, Yahaya said the military has proven itself in Nigeria and abroad, adding that they should be appreciated. “Over the years, we have proven ourselves both in Nigeria and abroad with our competence and skills, commitment and dedication with which we do our jobs,” he said. “It is time to appreciate our troops, including those who have paid the supreme price in their efforts to ensure Nigeria is secured and remains united. “We will continue to appreciate the support of the president and all those who have supported us.”
