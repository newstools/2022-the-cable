An official of the Niger Delta Development Commission (NDDC), identified  as Kingsley Okorafor, has been abducted from his residence in Imo state. Okororafor was said to have been abducted from Umuadara Umulogho autonomous community in the early hours of Saturday. According to NAN, Patrick Uwalaka, the traditional ruler of the community, confirmed the development. Uwalaka said the incident caused a stir in the community, particularly as it happened about three kilometres away from a military checkpoint in the area. A member of the family, who pleaded anonymity, said Okoroafor had attended the wake-keep of a traditional ruler in one of the autonomous communities in Obowo LGA of the state, hours before he was abducted. The source also said he believed the NDDC official was trailed after he left the event, adding that Okoroafor’s car was left behind. Efforts to get a response on the incident from Mike Abattam, Imo police public relations officer (PPRO), were unsuccessful. The development comes amid attacks on communities across Imo state within the past months. Meanwhile, Hope Uzodimma, governor of Imo, had recently asked bandits operating in the state’s forests to surrender and receive unconditional pardon. The governor had given bandits 10 days — beginning from June 25 — to surrender, adding that there would be severe consequences for those who refused to do so.
