Youths of Amaeshe LGA in Imo state, on Sunday, took to the streets to protest the alleged killing of a resident in the area. The victim, identified as “25-year-old Kelechi Ogbonna”, was alleged to have been killed by operatives of Ebube Agu. In a video clip circulating on social media, a Sienna vehicle said to be conveying the security operatives was seen driving away, after which gunshots were heard, which caused people to run helter-skelter. An eyewitness from the community, who didn’t want to be named, said the Ebube Agu operatives came to the community to carry out an arrest but the youths asked them what grounds they had for the operation. “They came to arrest a youth but they were questioned if policemen were aware. They started shooting and, in the process, killed Kelechi Ogbonna. They injured others that have now been hospitalised,” the resident said. The victim was said to be a student of Priscilla Memorial Grammar School in Oguta. Michael Abattam, Imo police spokesperson, did not respond to an enquiry on the development. In April 2021, south-east governors announced the setup of a joint security outfit, codenamed ‘Ebube Agu’, with the aim to tackle insecurity in the zone. However, there have been reports of incidents involving the security outfit. In July 2022, Amnesty International, called on the federal government to investigate allegations of extrajudicial killings involving Ebube Agu operatives.
