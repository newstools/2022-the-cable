Ifeanyi Okowa, governor of Delta, says he and Atiku Abubakar, presidential candidate of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP), will deal with the “myriad of issues” facing Nigerians. In a series of tweets on Saturday, the PDP vice-presidential candidate said with Abubakar as president, all Nigerians will benefit from efforts to take the country to greatness. “There has been no time in the history of our country that the demand for good leadership has been more compelling than the times that we are living in,” he said. “This is why, with Atiku Abubakar at the helm of our nation’s affairs, no one will be left behind in the march to our country’s greatness. “Together, we will work to get the diverse people of this great country to stand together as one people with one future, and we will address the myriad of issues that you and your families are facing.” In June, Abubakar named Okowa as his running mate for the 2023 presidential election. Abubakar had said he opted for the Delta governor as his running mate because he meets “all or most of the qualities” he desires. “He personifies not only the seriousness the current moment represents for our country but also the future that our young people yearn for and deserve,” he had said. Meanwhile, Abubakar’s decision has elicited varied reactions from party members, especially from the panel members who had nominated Nyesom Wike, governor of Rivers, for the position.
