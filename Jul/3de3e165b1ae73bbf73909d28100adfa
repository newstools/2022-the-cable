Mohammed Hayatu-Deen, a former Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) presidential hopeful, says the election of Ademola Adeleke as governor of Osun state shows that the will of the people can prevail in a fair political environment. Adeleke, candidate of the PDP, was announced as the winner of the election on Sunday morning. He polled 403,371 votes to defeat Gboyega Oyetola, the incumbent governor, who got 375,027 votes. The PDP flag bearer won 17 LGAs while Oyetola, the All Progressives Congress (APC) candidate, secured victory in 13 LGAs. In a statement issued on Monday by Umar Sani, his spokesperson, Hayatu-deen said the election reflects the decision of the majority of voters. “On behalf of my family and entire team, we congratulate my dear brother, senator Ademola Adeleke on his emergence as the people’s choice for the office of the next governor of Osun state,” Hayatu-deen was quoted as saying. “By extension, I rejoice with the good people of Osun state, our dear party, the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP), and Nigerians in general for the victory recorded at the just-concluded Osun state gubernatorial elections. “The people of Osun state have shown that under a free and fair condition, the will of the people prevails. We must also give kudos to INEC and all concerned security agencies for conducting a peaceful and credible election, which is the hallmark of true democracy.” Hayatu-deen said the election result “demonstrated that Nigeria’s democratic structures are not forlorn”. The former managing director of the defunct FSB International Bank said Nigeria should “build on this momentum to conduct peaceful and credible general elections come 2023”. Hayatu-deen, who was seeking to clinch the presidential ticket of the PDP, withdrew from the race hours before the primary election in May. He attributed his withdrawal to the “monetisation of the contest”, but however promised to remain loyal to the party.
