The office of the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) in Igboeze north LGA of Enugu state has been set ablaze by hoodlums. INEC disclosed this on Monday in a statement signed by Festus Okoye, its national commissioner, information and voter education. According to the statement, Emeka Ononamadu, the resident electoral commissioner for Enugu state, reported that the attack happened at 11.48pm on Sunday. The commission said the arsonists overpowered the security guards, forced their way into the  premises and set the building ablaze. “Although no casualties were reported, 748 ballot boxes, 240 voting cubicles, office furniture and equipment were destroyed in spite of the best effort of the Enugu State Fire Service deployed from Nsukka,” the statement reads. “The Commission is working to ascertain the status of voter registration machines for the ongoing Continuous Voter Registration (CVR) exercise as well as uncollected Permanent Voters Cards (PVCs) locked up in the fireproof cabinet. “The incident has been reported to the  Nigeria Police for investigation and further action. “The attack, coming in the middle of the voter registration exercise and other  preparations for 2023 General Election, is worrisome. It will be recalled that on 23rd May 2021, our office in the neighbouring Igboeze South Local Government Area was attacked in a similar manner by unknown gunmen. This followed earlier attacks on Udenu Local Government Area office on 13th May 2021 and the State Headquarters in Enugu on 16th May 2021. The Commission has since substantially recovered from these attacks and resumed normal activities there, including the CVR and collection of PVCs. “The Commission will continue to work with the security agencies and the emergency services to protect our facilities.” <img class="alignnone wp-image-719946" src="https://f5p3e9e4.stackpathcdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/Burnt-INEC-office-in-Imo4-1.jpg" alt="INEC office in Enugu burnt " width="550" height="309" srcset="https://f5p3e9e4.stackpathcdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/Burnt-INEC-office-in-Imo4-1.jpg 960w, https://f5p3e9e4.stackpathcdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/Burnt-INEC-office-in-Imo4-1-300x169.jpg 300w, https://f5p3e9e4.stackpathcdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/Burnt-INEC-office-in-Imo4-1-768x432.jpg 768w, https://f5p3e9e4.stackpathcdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/Burnt-INEC-office-in-Imo4-1-24x14.jpg 24w, https://f5p3e9e4.stackpathcdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/Burnt-INEC-office-in-Imo4-1-36x20.jpg 36w, https://f5p3e9e4.stackpathcdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/Burnt-INEC-office-in-Imo4-1-48x27.jpg 48w" sizes="(max-width: 550px) 100vw, 550px" /> <img class="alignnone wp-image-719947" src="https://f5p3e9e4.stackpathcdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/Burnt-INEC-office-in-Imo3-1.jpg" alt="INEC office in Enugu burnt " width="550" height="344" srcset="https://f5p3e9e4.stackpathcdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/Burnt-INEC-office-in-Imo3-1.jpg 1080w, https://f5p3e9e4.stackpathcdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/Burnt-INEC-office-in-Imo3-1-300x188.jpg 300w, https://f5p3e9e4.stackpathcdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/Burnt-INEC-office-in-Imo3-1-1024x640.jpg 1024w, https://f5p3e9e4.stackpathcdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/Burnt-INEC-office-in-Imo3-1-768x480.jpg 768w, https://f5p3e9e4.stackpathcdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/Burnt-INEC-office-in-Imo3-1-24x15.jpg 24w, https://f5p3e9e4.stackpathcdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/Burnt-INEC-office-in-Imo3-1-36x23.jpg 36w, https://f5p3e9e4.stackpathcdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/Burnt-INEC-office-in-Imo3-1-48x30.jpg 48w" sizes="(max-width: 550px) 100vw, 550px" /> <img class="alignnone wp-image-719948" src="https://f5p3e9e4.stackpathcdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/Burnt-INEC-office-in-Imo2-1.jpg" alt="" width="550" height="344" srcset="https://f5p3e9e4.stackpathcdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/Burnt-INEC-office-in-Imo2-1.jpg 1080w, https://f5p3e9e4.stackpathcdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/Burnt-INEC-office-in-Imo2-1-300x188.jpg 300w, https://f5p3e9e4.stackpathcdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/Burnt-INEC-office-in-Imo2-1-1024x640.jpg 1024w, https://f5p3e9e4.stackpathcdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/Burnt-INEC-office-in-Imo2-1-768x480.jpg 768w, https://f5p3e9e4.stackpathcdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/Burnt-INEC-office-in-Imo2-1-24x15.jpg 24w, https://f5p3e9e4.stackpathcdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/Burnt-INEC-office-in-Imo2-1-36x23.jpg 36w, https://f5p3e9e4.stackpathcdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/Burnt-INEC-office-in-Imo2-1-48x30.jpg 48w" sizes="(max-width: 550px) 100vw, 550px" /> <img class="alignnone wp-image-719949" src="https://f5p3e9e4.stackpathcdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/Burnt-INEC-office-in-Imo-1.jpg" alt="" width="550" height="344" />
