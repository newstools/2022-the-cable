Dapo Abiodun, governor of Ogun, says his administration will carry out a “total reconstruction” of the Lagos-Sango Ota-Abeokuta road, if the federal government doesn’t intervene within two weeks. He said this on Saturday during an inspection visit to the area. Abiodun, who declared a state of emergency on the road, said the decision to give the federal government a time-frame for intervention is in the interest of improving the welfare of residents. “At its expiration, the state government would, putting the safety and comfort of its citizens first, have no choice than to immediately intervene through total reconstruction,” the governor said. The Ogun chapter of the Nigeria Labour Congress (NLC) had, in October 2021, staged a protest over the poor state of the road, but Abiodun had said the concerns should be channeled to the federal government which is in charge of the project. During his inspection visit on Saturday, the Ogun governor was also at the Owode-Ilaro road, and he revoked the contract of the company in charge of the Owode-Iwoye part of the project. He added that the CCECC “will now handle all the roadworks” relating to the Owode-Ilaro project. For the Ojodu-Abiodun-Akute-Oke Aro-Agbado-Ijoko-Sango road, Abiodun promised that reconstruction would begin within the next three weeks.
