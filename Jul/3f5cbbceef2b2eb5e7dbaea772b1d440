Uba Sani, governorship candidate of the All Progressives Congress (APC) in Kaduna, has announced Hadiza Balarabe, the current deputy governor, as his running mate. Sani, who is the senator representing Kaduna central, announced the development in a statement on Monday published on his social media pages. Although Balarabe had reportedly earlier expressed interest in contesting the governorship position before the party’s primary in May, Sani was later chosen as the party’s consensus candidate. Speaking on his choice of the deputy governor as running mate, the lawmaker said he arrived at the decision after consultations with “critical stakeholders”. “After consultations with critical stakeholders of Kaduna State, I am happy to announce that I have picked Her Excellency, Dr. Hadiza Sabuwa Balarabe, as my running mate in the 2023 governorship election in Kaduna State,” the statement reads. “Dr. Hadiza Balarabe has contributed immensely to the giant strides recorded by the Mallam Nasir El-Rufai’s administration in infrastructure and human capital development. “Dr. Balarabe has demonstrated hard work, punctuality, dedication and team spirit in the discharge of her responsibility as Deputy Governor which has endeared her to the critical stakeholders in the State. “I wish to therefore call on the good people of Kaduna State to support the choice of Dr. Hadiza Sabuwa Balarabe as my running mate. I also enjoin them coming out en-masse to vote for our ticket during the forthcoming 2023 general election. Your mandate in 2023 will enable us to build a peaceful, prosperous, and greater Kaduna State. “Together, we are determined to make the State a reference point for good and responsive governance.”
