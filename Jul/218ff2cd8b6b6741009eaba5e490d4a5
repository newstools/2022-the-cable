The chairman of Osogbo motor park, identified simply as Borepo, says Ademola Adeleke, governorship candidate of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP), has nothing to offer Osun people. Borepo spoke on Saturday after casting his vote in the ongoing governorship election in the state. “Demola does not have the power to control us in Osun state. If he wins, his elder sister, Dupe, will be the one controlling him. He does not have the strength. Demola, the dancer, he has nothing to offer. PDP has failed,” Borepo said. He said they expected Gboyega Oyetola, governor of Osun who is seeking re-election, to “share money”, but he didn’t. Borepo, however, added that he still prefers Oyetola to get a second term instead of Adeleke winning the governorship election. “APC didn’t give us money. We voted for them, thought they would share money, but they did not. Notwithstanding, we want Oyetola again,” he said. Asked how he would feel if Adeleke wins, he replied: “God forbid. He won’t win. It’s going to affect my work. I am the chairman of the garage, that means a new government, a new chairman. I don’t want Adeleke to win.” On his assessment of Oyetola’s first term, Borepo said while things have not been perfect, the governor has performed well. “In this his tenure, I have benefitted not by his money, but I make my own money through my business. Things are going smoothly. It’s Oyetola one more time,” he said. “I called Ilobu and I learnt Oyetola is winning there. Look at Osun; good things are happening in Oyetola’s tenure. Full salary! I’ve never seen Osun workers carrying placards around the state to protest. Though no one is perfect, he is trying.” Asked why he is not voting for Lasun Yusuf, candidate of the Labour Party (LP), who is also from his home town (Ilobu), he said: “Who is Lasun? He has nothing to give Osun. He is just stubborn; he can’t win.”
