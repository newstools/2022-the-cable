Ikechi Emenike, governorship candidate of the All Progressives Congress (APC) in Abia, says low budgeting is the reason for underdevelopment in the state. Addressing a recent stakeholders’ forum at Ututu in Arochukwu LGA, Emenike said an annual budget below N200 billion was insufficient to pull Abia out of poverty. “Any budget less than N200 billion cannot develop Abia,” he said, adding that in order to satisfy the needs of growing the state to enviable heights, he would discover innovative methods to increase the state budget. Emenike added that apart from being insufficient, Abia budgets “are not people-oriented”. “The budget of Abia should have the face of every Abian in it. Citizens see themselves in the budget of countries where good governance is practised,” he said. Speaking on Abia workers and pensioners, he accused the government of owing salaries and pensions, adding that the government would not have “found itself in such a mess” if budgets were people-oriented. He said if elected, he would form a committee of retired professionals to oversee the payment of pensions and salary arrears. He said he would leverage his experience and international networks to stimulate economic growth in Abia, and build “a first world state within a third world country”. “There will be economic activities in every local government of Abia,” he said. “You are stakeholders in Abia and you must be concerned about the bad condition of the state. Let us say no to bad governance. Let everybody stand up to be counted in our rescue mission.”
