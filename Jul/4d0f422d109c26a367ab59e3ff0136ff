The Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) has alleged that some chieftains of the All Progressives Congress (APC) made efforts to scuttle the governorship election in Osun state. Last Sunday, Ademola Adeleke, candidate of the PDP, was declared the winner of the election. Adeleke secured 403,371 votes to defeat his closest challenger, Gboyega Oyetola of the All Progressives Congress (APC), who polled 375,027 votes. The governor-elect had contested in 2018 and polled ahead by less than 400 votes, but the election was declared inconclusive after the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) said the number of cancelled votes – over 3,000 — exceeded the difference between both parties. Oyetola eventually became governor after he won the rerun, and although Adeleke challenged the election outcome, the supreme court, in July 2019, upheld Oyetola as the winner of the poll. Speaking in a press conference on Friday, Debo Ologunagba, PDP spokesperson, alleged that some APC stalwarts convened in Abuja to “truncate” the Osun election. The PDP spokesman, however, added that the bid “was turned down”. “Our party is privy to reports of how doors were locked against APC leaders in Abuja and how their frantic telephone calls and corrupt offers to truncate the Osun election were turned down,” he said. “The APC presidential candidate can recall that our party had in a statement on June 8, 2022, cautioned him that he will soon realize that Nigeria is not one of his acquired estates or fiefdoms and that Nigerians are not his political string-puppets and retinue of lackeys.” The opposition party added that Tinubu “has no political fighting chance in the face of the soaring popularity of PDP’s very competent, candid, transparent, people-oriented and much more prepared” presidential candidate, Atiku Abubakar.
