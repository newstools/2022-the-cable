Three governors on the platform of the All Progressives Congress (APC) are currently at a meeting with Nyesom Wike, governor of Rivers. The governors — Rotimi Akeredolu of Ondo, Kayode Fayemi of Ekiti, and Babajide Sanwo-Olu of Lagos — are at the residence of the Rivers governor, who is a member of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP), in Port Harcourt, the state capital. Also present at the meeting is Ayodele Fayose, former Ekiti governor and PDP member. The governors are meeting behind closed doors. The development comes amid speculations over if Wike will defect from PDP after losing the party’s presidential and vice-presidential tickets. While the Rivers governor had lost the PDP presidential ticket to Atiku Abubakar, he was said to be the preferred candidate chosen by a panel for the vice-presidential slot. However, Abubakar had eventually chosen Ifeanyi Okowa, governor of Delta, as his running mate — a development which did not sit well with the likes of Samuel Ortom, Benue governor. Also, recently, there had been rumours over Wike meeting Bola Tinubu, APC presidential candidate, when the former was in France on vacation. However, Tinubu’s media office had denied the claim, saying while the APC presidential candidate has nothing against Wike, no meeting of the sort happened.
