The MNJTF operates in the Chad, Cameroon and Nigeria. According to Zagazola Makama, a counter-insurgency expert in the Lake Chad region, the ISWAP fighters were killed on Friday by military airstrikes in Sabon Tumbun and Jibularam in Marte LGA of Borno state. Sources reportedly said the the operation followed credible intelligence reports indicating that the ISWAP fighters were converging in large numbers. “A battle damaged assessment has indicated that the air interdiction had recorded devastating impact as many jihadists were killed, while others were severely wounded,” a source was quoted as saying. “We couldn’t ascertain the exact figure of the terrorists killed, but they are more than a dozen.” In May, MNJTF had killed two prominent leaders of the ISWAP identified as Bako Gorgore and Aba Ibrahim, in Abadam LGA of Borno state.
