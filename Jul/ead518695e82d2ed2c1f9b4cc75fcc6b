The house of representatives has resolved to investigate the attack on the correctional facility in Kuje, federal capital territory (FCT). The resolution was passed at plenary session on Thursday following the adoption of a motion sponsored by Sha’aban Sharada, a lawmaker from Kano. On July 5, 2022, gunmen attacked the Kuje prison facility and freed hundreds of inmates, including suspected members of Boko Haram. President Muhammadu Buhari had expressed disappointment over the attack and queried why terrorists are able to successfully “attack a security installation and get away with it”. A day after the attack, the Islamic State for West Africa Province (ISWAP) claimed responsibility. On July 8, the federal government declared the fleeing inmates wanted and published their names and photos. While moving his motion, Sharada, who is the chairman of the house committee on national security and intelligence, said public peace and safety will “continue to be threatened” if urgent steps are not taken to address the recurrent attack on the nation’s prisons. “The development makes the country and the federal capital territory, in particular, vulnerable and under the fear of attacks, risk intimidation and all sorts of threats due to a large number of criminal escapees in the country,” he said. “The Kuje custodial centre attack and its terrible outcome along with several related crimes against national security are on the increase despite stakeholders commitment towards equipping the national security enforcement and intelligence community with a significant appropriation of funds.” The motion was unanimously adopted when it was put to a voice vote by Idris Wase, the deputy speaker. The house subsequently mandated the committees on national security and intelligence, interior, reformatory services, defence, army, airforce, navy and police to “investigate the causes, dimensions and effects of the unfortunate Kuje custodial centre attack” and report back within four days.
