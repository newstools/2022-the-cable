Five people were swept away by a flood in the Oyatoki area of Agege, Lagos state on Saturday. In a statement by Ibrahim Farinloye, zonal coordinator, south-west, National Emergency Management Agency (NEMA), the incident involved two vehicles — a Lexus jeep carrying three persons and a Toyota with three occupants. Farinloye said six persons were reported to have been swept away when rainwater overflowed an uncompleted canal in the area. He, however, said three of the victims have been rescued while two are still missing. “The residents reportedly warned the people in the vehicles to desist from passing through the road but they were adamant but drove through, and they were swept away,” he said. “One of the people in the Toyota refused to drop down from the vehicle, the other two drove, and they are the only ones missing presently. “All together, three rescued alive, one jumped out to safety, while the remaining two are missing.” Farinloye said the emergency responders on the ground include the Lagos State Fire Service, NEMA, LASEMA, police and other responders from the community. “Search and rescue operations are ongoing in search of the other two persons,” he added. “The community members are mobilised due to the fact that they know the terrain of the canal and successfully rescued the four persons.” The incident has sparked different reactions from some Nigerians on Twitter.
