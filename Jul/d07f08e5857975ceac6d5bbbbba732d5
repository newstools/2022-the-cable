Abdullahi Adamu, national chairman of the All Progressives Congress (APC), says his party will “not take any chances” on ensuring its victory in the Osun governorship election. Adamu said this on Tuesday while speaking at the APC rally ahead of the election. The APC chairman also urged members of the party in the state to ensure they remain united in order to secure victory for Gboyega Oyetola, who is seeking re-election. “We are taking no chances; that’s why APC will stand out in its full strength to support our candidate,” he said. “Like one of the speakers said a while ago, those who have got a fair mind will testify to the fact that governor Gboyega has done so much since assuming office in this state. “We are here to canvass for your support and to appeal to you the genuine, proper APC members of this state to turn out en masse next Saturday, the 16th of July, 2022. “We did it in less than a month in Ekiti. We are here to work and pray for a repeat performance, even a better performance. I understand this state has a higher population than Ekiti, so we expect higher return of votes from Osun state. “As a party, we’ll do all that is possible in the circumstances to give all the support our candidate and the APC in Osun will require of us.”
