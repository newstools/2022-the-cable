Vice-President Yemi Osinbajo is currently at the hospital for a surgical procedure over pain in his leg. Laolu Akande, spokesman to the vice-president, disclosed this on Saturday. According to Akande, Osinbajo’s surgery is “on account of a recurrent leg pain in the leg possibly sustained from an injury while playing squash”. The spokesman, however, did not name the hospital where the vice-president is undergoing the surgery. “His doctors would give an update of the treatment later today,” Akande added. Meanwhile, the development comes days after Osinbajo attended a meeting with diplomats in Abuja on Africa’s role on energy transition. Diplomats presented at the meeting, which took place on Thursday, were from countries including USA, UK, Germany, Canada, France, Japan, and Egypt. “Developing a common African narrative is absolutely important because it sets the stage in providing a clear vision and a clear objective to have a Pan African initiative,” Akande had quoted the vice-president as saying in a statement. “The broad-based coalition will ensure that the private sector and government work together in driving the processes and the nuances are adequately taken care of. It is important that we factor in all the nuances across the continent.”
