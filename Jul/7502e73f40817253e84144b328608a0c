The Lagos police command says its officers have arrested some persons allegedly impersonating officials of the Corporate Affairs Commission (CAC) in the state. According to the police, five suspects were arrested at their makeshift office located at Jobi Gele way, Alausa, Ikeja, following a tip-off. Benjamin Hundeyin, Lagos police spokesperson, in a statement on Thursday, identified the suspects as 28-year-old Gloria Ukaegbu; 30-year-old Omolere Kayode; 34-year-old Taiwo Ajayi; 27-year-old Nwachukwu Brenda, and Oluwatomisin Adebisi, aged 25. Hundeyin added that the police recovered “forged” CAC documents used by the suspects. “Led by the Commander RRS, CSP Olayinka Egbeyemi, the operatives recovered several forged CAC documents, a Toyota Sienna and a Toyota Matrix used as makeshift offices for their nefarious transactions,” the statement reads. “Preliminary investigation reveals that the syndicate has swindled over hundreds of people through fake CAC registrations. “Meanwhile, the Lagos State Commissioner of Police, CP Abiodun Alabi, has directed that the case be transferred to the State Criminal Investigations Department, Panti, for further investigations and eventual prosecution.”
