Kemi Badenoch, former UK equalities minister, has taken a swipe at Nigerian politicians and accused them of using public funds for their private matters. Badenoch, a UK member of parliament of Nigerian descent, said this on Monday during an event to mark the commencement of her campaign for the office of the UK prime minister on Tuesday. The 42-year-old was among several ministers that resigned over loss of confidence in Boris Johnson’s style of governance. Boris Johnson had resigned as UK prime minister on July 7. Badenoch, who had earlier announced her interest in contesting, said she chose to run for the office of UK prime minister in line with her ambition to serve a country that gives her the opportunity to maximise her potential. Speaking on her growing-up years in Nigeria, she said Nigerian politicians have a knack for making promises and failing to keep those promises. “I am running for prime minister because I am ambitious. I am ambitious for our country and for our party. I chose to be the conservative MP to serve and choose this country because here, I can be free and do anything I want to be here,” she said. “I grew up in Nigeria and saw firsthand what happens when politicians are running for themselves when they use public money as their private piggybanks, when they promise the earth and pollute not just the air, but the whole political atmosphere with their failure to serve others. “I saw what socialism means. For millions, it is poverty and broken dreams. I came to Britain determined to make my way in a country where hard work and honest endeavour can take you anywhere.”
