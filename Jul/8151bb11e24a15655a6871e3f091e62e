Packed with powerful features at a low price, itel’s P38 smartphone was named the ‘Best Fast Charging Phone Under 100 Dollars For The African Market’ by the XDA, one of the largest global Android resources that serves millions of global readers every month. The itel P38 was released mid-May 2022 as the latest hero smartphone for the itel P Series with the tagline ‘Charge Faster, Play More’. itel’s P series is known for offering big battery, big screen, and other powerful features for users every year, and the itel P38 is no different.  It is bigger and better. This begins with the 15w fast charging and 5000mAh battery on the itel P38. With just ten minutes of charge time, you can get three hours of talk time, and with twenty minutes of charge you can be online for as long as ten hours. The itel P38 charges to 100% in two and a half hours, less time than last year’s itel P37. The wonders of 15w fast charging. <img class="alignnone wp-image-725857" src="https://f5p3e9e4.stackpathcdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/Screenshot_20220719-082210_Office.jpg" alt="" width="550" height="561" srcset="https://f5p3e9e4.stackpathcdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/Screenshot_20220719-082210_Office.jpg 777w, https://f5p3e9e4.stackpathcdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/Screenshot_20220719-082210_Office-294x300.jpg 294w, https://f5p3e9e4.stackpathcdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/Screenshot_20220719-082210_Office-768x784.jpg 768w, https://f5p3e9e4.stackpathcdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/Screenshot_20220719-082210_Office-24x24.jpg 24w, https://f5p3e9e4.stackpathcdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/Screenshot_20220719-082210_Office-36x36.jpg 36w, https://f5p3e9e4.stackpathcdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/Screenshot_20220719-082210_Office-48x48.jpg 48w" sizes="(max-width: 550px) 100vw, 550px" /> While many smartphone users are often asked to choose between functionality and appearance, itel says you can have both.
