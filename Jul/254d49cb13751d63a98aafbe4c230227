OrderPaper Nigeria, a media organisation dedicated to reporting parliamentary affairs, says it will spotlight the most performing lawmakers in the national assembly The event, ‘Evening of Sparkles’, is scheduled to hold on Thursday at the Transcorp Hilton Hotel in Abuja. The event, which aims to recognise performing legislators, will spotlight 40 nominees out of the 496 members in the national assembly for possible induction into the “most valuable parliamentarian (MVP)” hall of fame. The news organisation said the event is the “second of steps in the most valuable parliamentarians (MVPs) hall of fame designed by OrderPaper Nigeria and implemented alongside a cluster of renowned civil society partners”. Oke Epia, executive director of OrderPaper, said the MVP hall of fame is “an elite and invitation-only framework to laud and encourage exemplary legislative performances while engendering a community of healthy and productive partnerships between the legislature, civil society, and the citizenry in Nigeria”. “The eventual MVPs are a distinct class of legislators who are performance-driven, excellence-inspired, and public-spirited and carefully chosen by an objective, painstaking, and data-driven appraisal process,” he said. “These efforts are part of our modest contributions to legislative strengthening and promoting improved service delivery by the National Assembly of Nigeria.”
