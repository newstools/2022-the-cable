The Zamfara government has flagged off the training of community protection guards (CPG) — the state’s equivalent of a joint task force. The event, which held on Saturday, had Bello Matawalle, governor of Zamfara, heads of security agencies, and other stakeholders in attendance. According to a statement by Jamilu Magaji, chief press secretary to the governor, the launch of the security outfit will support the efforts of security agencies to tackle banditry in the state. “As community protection guards, yours is a patriotic call. Your names would stand out in history as people with remarkable patriotism, selflessness and love for peace,” Matawalle was quoted as saying while addressing the volunteers. “Only people with courage and bravery will offer to serve as guards of their communities, bravely standing up to face the brutal infamy of the bandits.” Matawalle also urged members of the CPG to ensure they work according to the rules of engagement, and promote efforts at building peaceful communities. Among those listed as present at the event were Ayuba Elkana, Zamfara police commissioner; Mamman Tsafe, Zamfara commissioner for security and home affairs, Nasiru Magarya, speaker of the Zamfara assembly; Kabiru Balarabe, secretary to the state government; Ibrahim Suleiman, chief of staff; Kabiru Gayari, head of service, among others.
