President Muhammadu Buhari says he will not allow security chiefs rest until the situation of security in the country improves. He said this on Wednesday in reaction to the killing of a Catholic priest in Kaduna state. John Cheitnum, priest of the Kafanchan Catholic diocese, was found dead after he was abducted by gunmen on July 15 in Kaduna. In a statement issued on Wednesday by Garba Shehu, presidential spokesman, Buhari condemned the killing, and said his administration remains committed to ensuring improved security. “I am deeply disturbed by the murder of this revered religious figure by outlaws who seem to be bent on creating chaos and disorder in the country,” Buhari was quoted as saying. “The persistent attack on innocent people, including religious figures, by gunmen is a matter of grave concern for this administration, because security is one of the major issues of our campaign promises. “Let me reassure Nigerians that my commitment to this issue is as firm as ever. I have always made it a duty to regularly summon security chiefs to discuss these challenges and the way forward. “I’m not allowing the security chiefs to rest unless and until we find a very effective solution to this disturbing security situation. “I assure Nigerians that we are determined to crush these enemies of humanity with all the resources at our disposal.” Buhari also extended his condolences to Cheitnum’s family and the Christian community in Kaduna.
