Babagana Zulum, governor of Borno, has approved Thursday and Friday as public holidays for workers to obtain their permanent voter cards (PVCs). The approval was contained in a circular signed by Simon Malgwi, the state head of service. “This is to inform you that Governor of Borno State, Prof. Babagana Umara Zulum, has approved Thursday and Friday, being 21st and 22nd of July, 2022 as public holidays to enable civil servants and public office holders in the state to obtain their PVC,” the statement reads. “Civil servants and public office holders are therefore urged to use this opportunity to ensure that they obtain the PVC to enable them exercise their franchise as responsible citizens.” Borno joins other states such as Zamfara, Niger, Plateau and Bauchi that also declared work-free days for civil servants to participate in voter registration. Meanwhile, the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) has fixed July 31 as the deadline for voter registration. The electoral commission has also extended registration hours to eight hours daily — from 9am to 5pm — instead of the current duration of six hours daily.
