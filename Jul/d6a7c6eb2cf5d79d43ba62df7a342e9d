The National Drug Law Enforcement Agency (NDLEA) says it arrested Suleiman Sidi, a Boko Haram suspect who escaped from Kuje prison. Femi Babafemi, spokesman of the NDLEA, said this in a statement on Monday. Last week, gunmen suspected to be Boko Haram insurgents attacked the prison, freeing prisoners some of who are members of the terror group. Bashir Magashi, minister of defence, had said all 64 members of the terror group escaped. Babafemi said the suspect was arrested while trying to board a vehicle heading for Borno from a park located in Area 1, Abuja. The spokesman said three wraps of cannabis were found on him when he was searched. “The fleeing terror suspect, Suleiman Sidi, was arrested in the early hours of Monday 11th July at Area 1 motorpark, in the Federal Capital Territory while attempting to board a commercial vehicle to Maiduguri, Borno state,” he said. “During preliminary interview, the wanted terror suspect confimed he was remanded at the Kuje Correctional Centre for terrorism and robbery charges, adding that he was indeed one of the inmates who escaped from the facility last Tuesday. “While commending the officers and men of the FCT Command of the Agency for the arrest and their vigilance, Chairman/Chief Executive Officer of the National Drug Law Enforcement Agency, NDLEA, Brig. Gen. Mohamed Buba Marwa (Retd) has directed that the wanted suspect should be immediately handed over to the Nigerian Correctional Service, NCoS.”
