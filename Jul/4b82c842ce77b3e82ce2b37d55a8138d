The Federal Road Safety Corps (FRSC) in Katsina says it will prosecute underaged persons caught driving in the state. In an interview with NAN on Sunday, Ali Sule, FRSC commander in the state, said it is a serious offence for children to drive. “The agency will view the act as a serious offence to see any underage child driving on high ways in the state,” he said. “If we catch any under-age, we will hand him or her over to mobile court to be prosecuted.” The commander urged parents to stop letting their underaged children operate vehicles on highways. Sule also encouraged drivers to keep their cars in top shape during rainy seasons. According to him, they should ensure that the wipers, tyres and lightning are all in perfect conditions to ensure visibility in the rainy season. He urged them to also stick to the stipulated speed limit while driving.
