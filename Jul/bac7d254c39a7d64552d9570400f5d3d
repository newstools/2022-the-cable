Boris Johnson, UK prime minister, will resign on Thursday following pressure from members of his government. A number of ministers had resigned from the government, citing a loss of trust in Johnson. The resignations followed the latest scandal to engulf Johnson’s government — his handling of the concerns raised over Chris Pincher, deputy chief whip, over allegations of sexual misconduct. Will Quince, minister for children and families; Robin Walker, minister of state for school standards, and John Glen, treasury minister, resigned their positions on Wednesday. On Tuesday, Sajid Javid, UK secretary of state for health and social care, and Rishi Sunak, UK treasury chief, resigned from the cabinet. Earlier in the year, Johnson appointed Pincher — who has now resigned over claims that he groped two men at a private members’ club  — as the deputy chief whip, despite the allegations. Although Johnson had apologised for backing Pincher, he vowed to fight on. “The job of a prime minister in difficult circumstances, when he has been handed a colossal mandate, is to keep going, and that’s what I’m going to do,” he had said. Several UK cabinet ministers reportedly gathered on Wednesday at the office of prime minister to ask him to resign. The delegation included Grant Shapps, transport secretary; Simon Hart, Welsh secretary; Brandon Lewis, Northern Ireland secretary; and Chris Heaton-Harris, chief whip. Nadhim Zahawi, the new chancellor who replaced Rishi Sunak, was also believed to be in the delegation.
