The Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) has issued a certificate of return to Ademola Adeleke, governor-elect of Osun and candidate of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP). Adeleke polled 403,371 votes to beat Gboyega Oyetola, governor of Osun and All Progressives Congress (APC) candidate in the governorship election. Oyetola is mulling going to court to challenge the victory of the PDP candidate. It’s been a long battle fought !! We put our Family name on the line , I put my career on the line ! But we had faith!! This was God testing us if we really believed in him !! I feel victorious! Congrats ! Your excellency @AAdeleke_01 ! As for me it’s back to the studio!  pic.twitter.com/96zJmeh68X — Davido (@davido) July 20, 2022    In 2018, the PDP candidate was leading in the polls, but the election was declared inconclusive by INEC on the grounds that the number of cancelled votes exceeded the difference in the votes between both parties. Oyetola eventually became governor after he won the rerun. Though Adeleke challenged the outcome, the supreme court in July 2019 upheld Oyetola as winner of the election. The rift between Rauf Aregbesola, minister of interior, and Oyetola over who controls the party’s structure in the state is said to have given Adeleke a chance to win the election. The minister was absent during the party’s campaign in the state, and did not vote in the election.
