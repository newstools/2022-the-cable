Security operatives surrounded the Bauchi state house of assembly on Monday, after concerns were reportedly raised over attempt to set the building on fire. The development comes days after 22 lawmakers asked Abubakar Suleiman, the speaker, to resign. On June 30, the lawmakers passed a vote of no confidence on the assembly’s leadership. The lawmakers said they were concerned over the “poor management of the 2022 hajj pilgrimage” and “dereliction of duty”, and cited these as reasons the speaker and his deputy should resign. Nine members of the assembly were absent when the confidence vote was held. Confirming the presence of security at the assembly complex, Sani Burra, the governor’s liaison to the assembly, said the measure was taken to avoid a breakdown of law and order. According to him, some persons made an attempt to burn the assembly building on Sunday. “Some unknown persons last night (Sunday) had attempted to burn the house complex as a result of which the security persons have taken over the place to avoid a break of law and order,” Burra said in a statement. “Immediately I was contacted, I informed the state commissioner of police on behalf of the state government for necessary and prompt action. “He too immediately mobilised personnel to the complex to ensure that no damage was done. “As you are aware, the crisis is that of the leadership of the house, not against the executive. We are trying to pacify the 22 lawmakers to wait for their colleagues who are presently on pilgrimages to Saudi Arabia and Israel before they will do whatever they want to do. “However, we have on authority that the 22 aggrieved members of the Assembly have insisted on going ahead with the impeachment and electing new leaders. “They are now waiting to gain entrance into the chamber to carry out the procedure.” In April, the speaker defected from the All Progressives Congress (APC) to the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP).
