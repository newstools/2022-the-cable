The proscribed Indigenous People of Biafra (IPOB) says there will be “consequences” if anything happens to Nnamdi Kanu, its leader, in the custody of the Department of State Service (DSS). In a statement on Sunday, Emma Powerful, IPOB spokesperson, said that owing to the recent attack on Kuje prison, the DSS custody where Kanu is being held can’t be said to be safe. Insurgents attacked the correctional service facility in the federal capital territory (FCT) on July 5. Hundreds of inmates, including Boko Haram suspects, escaped from the prison during the attack. Reacting, IPOB demanded the release of Kanu, adding that Nigerian prisons are no longer safe. “IPOB needs the release of our Leader Mazi Nnamdi Kanu because there is no prison that is safe for him, therefore we still need him released unconditionally,” the group said. The group said the number of jailbreaks under the watch of President Muhammadu Buhari is alarming. “There are many jailbreaks in Nigeria since Buhari and his party took over power and nothing was done or checked out the cause of these prison breaks,” IPOB said. The separatist group called for the “unconditional” release of Kanu “because his life in the DSS custody is not safe”.
