Nigeria qualified for the quarter-final of the Women Africa Cup of Nations (AWCON) with a 4-0 thumping of Burundi on Sunday night. Rasheedat Ajibade struck the first goal from the penalty spot 25 minutes into the first half. In the 28th minute, Peace Efih stabbed the ball home to give the Super Falcons a two-goal cushion. Mexico-based Uchenna Kanu then registered her name on the scoresheet before the half-hour mark to make it 3-0. The Super Falcons wasted chances to increase the lead before the halftime break. One minute after the restart, Uchenna Kanu grabbed a brace courtesy of Ajibade’s unselfish play. The nine-time African champions continued to create chances but were complacent in front of the goal. Meanwhile, in the other Group C game, South Africa pipped Botswana 1-0. The Super Falcons will face Cameroon in the quarter-final of the competition.
