The price of rams has increased significantly across the country ahead of the Eid-el-Kabir (Sallah) celebrations. At the Oluwaga ram market in the Ipaja area of Lagos state, small-sized rams are being sold from a range of N80,000 to N100,000, and medium sizes are sold within the range of N120,000 to N180,000, while the big-sized rams sell in the range of N250,000 to N350,000. A ram dealer at the market, who identified himself as Muhammad, told TheCable that ram prices rose sharply because the prices of other commodities have also gone up. He lamented that the cost of transporting the animals from Kano had also increased compared to the previous year. <img class="alignnone wp-image-720381" src="https://f5p3e9e4.stackpathcdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/IMG-20220705-WA0021.jpg" alt="" width="550" height="412" srcset="https://f5p3e9e4.stackpathcdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/IMG-20220705-WA0021.jpg 1280w, https://f5p3e9e4.stackpathcdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/IMG-20220705-WA0021-300x225.jpg 300w, https://f5p3e9e4.stackpathcdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/IMG-20220705-WA0021-1024x766.jpg 1024w, https://f5p3e9e4.stackpathcdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/IMG-20220705-WA0021-768x575.jpg 768w, https://f5p3e9e4.stackpathcdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/IMG-20220705-WA0021-24x18.jpg 24w, https://f5p3e9e4.stackpathcdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/IMG-20220705-WA0021-36x27.jpg 36w, https://f5p3e9e4.stackpathcdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/IMG-20220705-WA0021-48x36.jpg 48w" sizes="(max-width: 550px) 100vw, 550px" /> “I brought them from Kano. Diesel is expensive. Bringing them here takes a lot of money. Their food is also expensive,” Muhammad said. “Sometimes, these animals fall sick, and we have to treat them.
