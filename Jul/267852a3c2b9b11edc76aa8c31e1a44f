The police command in Ebonyi says its operatives have arrested a resident of the state for alleged impersonation. Chris Anyanwu, spokesman of the command, in a statement on Sunday, said the suspect was arrested on Saturday. He identified the suspect as Enyi Friday, adding that he was caught impersonating a police officer. “The Ebonyi State Police Command, on Saturday, July 2, through a coordinated effort with Anyigor Lazarus, the Commander of Ebubeagu security outfit in Ezza South Local Government Area, apprehended Enyi Friday,” the statement reads. “The suspect, who hails from Umunwagu Idembia community in the area, was impersonating the police. “The young man, who is not a police officer, was caught wearing the uniform of a Police Corporal, hence his arrest. “He has been handed over to the State Investigation and Intelligence Department, for further investigation.” The police spokesman also urged the general public to continue to partner with security operatives in the state to rid communities of criminal elements.
