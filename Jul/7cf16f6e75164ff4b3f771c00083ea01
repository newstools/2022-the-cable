Hope Uzodimma, governor of Imo, says his administration will ensure collaborative efforts to restore peace in the south-east before the 2023 elections. The governor spoke on Saturday at the south-east zonal stakeholders’ meeting of the All Progressives Congress (APC) in Owerri, the state capital. At the event, Uzodimma took a swipe at opposition politicians and accused them of refusing to condemn killings, destruction of public properties, and other crimes in the zone. “We will stop at nothing to ensure that peace is restored in south-east before 2023 general election,” he said. “We must move forward. The day I will leave our state to non-state actors will never come.” Speaking on the 2023 general election, the governor said the APC is in charge of twenty-two states, and expressed optimism that his party will secure victory across the states. Also speaking, Ijeoma Arodiogbu, APC’s national vice-chairman in the south-east, said the ruling party has performed well, especially in the region, with the completion of the second Niger Bridge. “We are united in our resolve to ensure that our presidential candidate, his excellency, Bola Ahmed Tinubu, receives the support of the south-east come next year,” he said. “We are also pleased with his choice of vice-presidential candidate in the person of his excellency, senator Kashim Shettima.” Arodiogbu urged APC stakeholders in the south-east to convince their communities to support the party. In attendance at the event were state chairmen of the APC from Enugu, Anambra, Abia, Ebonyi and Imo; Uche Nnaji, governorship candidate of the party from Enugu; Ikechi Emenike APC governorship candidate in Abia, and Francis Nwifuru, lawmaker from Ebonyi. Also present were Emma Eneukwu, the APC deputy national chairman, south; Goodluck Opiah, minister of state for education; Ikechukwu Ikoh, minister of state for science and technology, among others.
