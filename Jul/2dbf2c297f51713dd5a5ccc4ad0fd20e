Chukwuma Soludo, governor of Anambra, says eight persons have been arrested in connection with the killing of Okechukwu Okoye, lawmaker representing Aguata constituency II in the state house of assembly. The lawmaker, an indigene of Isuofia, the same community as Soludo, was kidnapped on May 15 alongside Cyril Chiegboka, his campaign director. The two men were later found dead — Okoye was beheaded. According to a statement by Christian Aburime, chief press secretary to the governor, Soludo disclosed the arrest of the suspects on Friday at the funeral for the lawmaker. “Eight persons suspected to be in connection with the murder of the late Anambra lawmaker who represented Aguata Constituency Two, Hon. Okechukwu Okoye, have been arrested,” the statement reads. “Anambra State Governor, Professor Charles Chukwuma Soludo, dropped the hint during a holy mass celebrated in honour of the lawmaker at St. Patrick’s Catholic Church, Isuofia.” Soludo also commiserated with the family of the deceased, and called on the residents of the state to support the government to tackle attacks by gunmen on communities. “These people are not unknown gunmen. They live among our people; some of them have families and operate from various communities. We need you to help us identify them so that they can face justice,” the governor was quoted as saying. “The gunmen came with their strange religion, but there is no relationship between light and darkness. Their gods drink blood, but ours doesn’t; that’s why we need to fight them together.”
