The Niger government has announced the suspension of all mining activities across three LGAs in the state. According to a statement issued on Monday by Ahmed Matane, secretary to the state government, mining activities are suspended in Munya, Shiroro and Rafi LGAs. The development comes days after residents and security personnel were killed by gunmen who attacked a mining site in Ajata Aboki village in Shiroro LGA of the state. A total of 48 bodies have been reportedly recovered following the attack. Matane said the measure was taken to address the security challenges in the state. “Following bandits’ attack on a mining site in Ajata Aboki vvillage in Shiroro local government area of Niger state, the Governor, Alhaji Abubakar Sani Bello, has ordered the immediate suspension of all mining activities in Shiroro, Munya, and Rafi local government areas of the state over continued bandits’ attacks until further notice,” the statement reads. “It is observed that these mining sites now attract or even accommodate criminals with prospective threats to the security of lives and property. “The state government has directed security agencies in the state to profile all mining sites in the affected local government areas with a view to ascertaining their genuineness.” He assured residents that the government will increase its efforts to ensure that bandits, kidnappers, cattle rustlers, and other criminal elements are eliminated from the state.
