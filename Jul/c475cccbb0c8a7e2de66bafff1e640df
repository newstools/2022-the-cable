Tsola Emiko, the Olu of Warri, says he was instructed by the Holy Spirit to stand before the oracle. He disclosed this in an interview with Punch Newspaper, published on Sunday, adding that he relies on the Holy Spirit for instruction. Reacting to a question that borders on his faith as a Christian and involvement in cultural practices associated with his position as a traditional ruler, he said he always seeks the leading of the Holy Spirit before engaging in such practices. “Christianity is more importantly about one’s individual’s relationship with Jesus Christ. When the Holy Spirit tells you to do a particular thing, even to fellow Christians, it may not sound Christian-like,” he said. “For instance, when it came to standing before the oracle, a lot of people felt that because I am a Christian, I wouldn’t do it. “However, I prayed about it and the Holy Spirit made it very clear to me not to be afraid. I was told to go and stand (before it), and I stood. “I believe that the spiritual world can be accessed by anyone of any faith. If one shies away from the spiritual world because one is afraid or because one is not aware of how it operates, one will lose out on a lot of good things that God himself has destined for one. “It is really about knowing one’s identity, knowing who one is, and being bold in that identity.”
