The 2023 presidential election is around the corner and so far, 15 candidates are scheduled to contest for the highest seat of power in Nigeria. Among Nigerians and party structures, there are debates on whether the north or south should produce the next president — especially at a time when the country is witnessing tension along ethnic and religious divides. Though there are 15 presidential candidates, the race is between three main candidates — Bola Tinubu (APC), Atiku Abubakar (PDP), and Peter Obi (LP). These contenders are from the three major ethnic groups in Nigeria — but there can be only one winner. Jam Jam and The Honourable discuss the highlights of the manifestoes of these candidates vis-à-vis the current realities and needs of the Nigerian people, with a focus on the prospects of one WAZOBIA candidate that can begin the birthing process of a unified and new Nigeria for all.
