Seven more abducted passengers of the Abuja- Kaduna train attack have been freed. According to the Kaduna-based Desert Herald newspaper, the son of Ango Abdullahi, chairman of Northern Elders Forum (NEF), is among the seven freed victims. Tukur Mamu, publisher of Desert Herald, confirmed the release of the abducted passengers. On March 28, a train on its way from Abuja was attacked by bandits in Kaduna. Several persons were killed, dozens injured, while others were abducted. Eleven of the abducted passengers had earlier been released in June. Mamu identified the newly-freed passengers as Muhammad Paki, Bosede Olurotimi, Abubakar Zubairu, Alhassan Sule, Sadiq Ango Abdullahi, Aliyu Usman and Muhammad Abuzar Afzal, a Pakistani. “I want to assure the nation that everything that was achieved today was singlehandedly initiated and arranged by me with the full support and prayers of my principal, Sheikh [Ahmad] Gumi,” he said. “That is why I keep emphasising that government has the power to end the agony of these innocent victims in one day. This is just one individual that sacrifice his life and even integrity. “There is no military solution to the current security debacle in Nigeria. When you sincerely engage them, these guys even though wicked with misguided religious beliefs, they are listening. “I have sufficient evidence to prove that they do listen. It is this power of engagement and sincerity that resulted to the release of [these] seven victims.” Abdulfatai Jimoh, the coordinator of the families of the abducted passengers, confirmed the release of the seven victims to TheCable. “Yes, it is true seven people were released today, I just spoke with the family of one of those released,” Jimoh said. The development comes four days after insurgents attacked and freed inmates of the Kuje correctional facility in Abuja.
