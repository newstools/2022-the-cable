Femi Adesina, presidential spokesman, says terrorist attacks in the country should not prevent President Muhammadu Buhari from fulfilling international obligations. Adesina said this on Wednesday while addressing journalists at the end of the weekly federal executive council (FEC) meeting in Abuja. Gunmen had attacked the Kuje prison in the federal capital territory (FCT) on Tuesday night, freeing over 500 inmates including Boko Haram insurgents. Hours before the incident, the president’s security team was attacked in Katsina state. Amid the spate of attacks in the country, Buhari is set to travel to Dakar, the Senegal capital, to participate in the International Development Association (IDA) for Africa summit. He is expected back in the country on Thursday. Reacting to criticisms trailing the president’s imminent trip, Adesina said Buhari should not disregard his duties. The presidential spokesman said a trip cancellation is tantamount to giving in to the terrorists. “Yes, the president should go because there’s an international conference meant for heads of states and presidents. He should attend. You should never give in to terrorists,” Adesina said. “The moment terrorists begin to stop you from doing things, then we might as well throw up our hands in surrender. The president should go ahead. It is an international obligation.” Garba Shehu, senior special assistant to the president on media & publicity, also addressed the criticism trailing Buhari’s trip. “The presidency wishes to use this opportunity to react to mounting criticism of the trip to Dakar, Senegal by the president, and to stress that governments don’t stop working because nations face terrorist threats,” Shehu said. “To cancel the trip to Senegal would mean that the terrorists are successful in calling the shots, something that no responsible government in the world will allow.”
