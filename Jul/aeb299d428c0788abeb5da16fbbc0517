Run Club Abuja, a fitness group in the federal capital territory (FCT), is planning a half marathon exercise in a bid to raise N3.5 million for the renovation of a primary healthcare centre (PHC) in Dei Dei, a suburb of the nation’s capital. The fitness club has scheduled the half marathon for July 16. Speaking with TheCable on Tuesday, Henry Okelue, founder of the club, said the half marathon was organised to commemorate the second anniversary of the fitness group. Okelue said in giving back to the community this year, they have decided to do something for health in the FCT. And in July 2022 we are back at it again, this time with the aim to raise 3.5m to rehabilitate and provide medical equipments and supplies to the Deidei Primary Healthcare Center. We know with your help we shall pull it off.
