An Anambra state high court sitting in Awka, on Wednesday, nullified the ward, local government and state congresses conducted by the All Progressives Congress (APC). The congresses conducted in January 2022 by the APC had produced Basil Ejidike as chairman of the party in the state. Delivering judgment, Ike Ogu, the presiding judge, held that the congresses breached the interlocutory injunction earlier issued by the court. The judgement followed a suit filed by Lawrence Emegini and four others. According to NAN, the judge said the tenure of executives for wards, local governments and state, elected during the 2018 congresses in Anambra, subsisted. He said any congress held by the APC and its representatives in the state while the 2018 elected executives were still in office was in violation of the court’s injunction. The court ruled that the executives led by Emeka Ibe should be allowed to finish their term. Reacting to the judgement, Chukwuma Agufugo, secretary of APC in the state said to be loyal to Ibe, described the ruling as a victory for the rule of law. “Some people had wanted to disorganise the party by attempting to hijack its leadership through the back door, but thank God that the court liberated the party,” he said.
