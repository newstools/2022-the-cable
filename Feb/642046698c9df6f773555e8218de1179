Three police officers have been reportedly killed following an attack on a checkpoint in Enugu south LGA of Enugu state. The incident was said to have occurred on Thursday afternoon. The gunmen were said to have shot sporadically in the area after killing the officers. When contacted, Daniel Ndukwe, police public relations officer (PPRO) in Enugu, said the details surrounding the incident are not yet clear. The police spokesperson added that security operatives are currently on the trail of the attackers. “Information surrounding the incident is still sketchy,” he said. “Meanwhile, a manhunt for the hoodlums has been initiated. Further development will be communicated.” In recent months, there have been several attacks by gunmen on communities across states in the south-east region. In January, two persons were killed after gunmen invaded the headquarters of the All Progressives Congress (APC) in Enugu state. The incident happened about two months after a female officer was abducted after an attack on the police divisional headquarters in Umulokpa, Uzo-Uwani LGA of the state.
