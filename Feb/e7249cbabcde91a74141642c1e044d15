Last December, surging food prices pushed inflation to 15.63 percent — the first increase after eight months of decline. At the end of the monetary policy committee of the Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN) meeting in January, members noted that inflation would moderate further going into the new year, driven by the significant interventions in the agricultural sector. The CBN MPC highlighted that the Nigerian economy is expected to continue with positive growth following the impressive growth recorded in the third quarter of 2021, reflecting continuous recovery from the recession.
