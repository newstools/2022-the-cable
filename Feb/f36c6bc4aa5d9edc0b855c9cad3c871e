The labour unions in the aviation industry have suspended the planned strike. They had fixed today for the commencement of the strike. The groups in the sector announced on Tuesday after signing a memorandum of settlement (MoS) with the federal government that they have shelved the action. The aviation workers had threatened to carry out industrial action over the government’s failure to fulfil its promise to implement the minimum wage and consequential adjustment since 2019 and the conditions of service since 2013. After the meeting, Chris Ngige, minister of labour and employment, emphasised that serious deliberations were made and the parties have agreed. He said the meeting concluded that all the agencies that had not paid the minimum wage allowances should write to the National Salaries, Incomes and Wages Commission (NSIWC) through the ministry of aviation for consideration/evaluation. “The National Salaries, Incomes and Wages Commission (NSIWC) was requested to issue a service-wide circular informing all organisations in the public and private sectors that they are bound to implement the National Minimum Wage of 2019/consequential adjustments,” Ngige said.
