Mary Oluwabukola, a recent winner of Vantage Migration all-expenses paid trip, has declared that Vantage Migration and  Allied Consult’s validity can be trusted without any iota of fear. Mary, a Chemical Engineering Graduate from Olabisi Onabanjo University, made this known while recounting her joys from the all-expenses-paid trip to Jordan in early February. According to her, “One of the fears that most people have is trying to register for something online because of the way people are being scammed constantly or on daily basis. But trust me, this company, Vantage Migration is valid.  Even though their lectures are online, it is flexible, reliable, and instructive. Aside from the trainings one get, for those who want to travel out of the country – “Japa” – you know, the training one receives also cover aspects of seeking scholarships, visa interviews and lots more. The company’s validity and its team can be trusted to the point because they are always and readily available to help and assist one in their study abroad relocation journey. So one should remove any worries, every fear or doubt, because this is so real.” She also advised everyone to partake in Dr. Linda’s Iheme travel contest by following her on her social media pages. “I will always advise anyone to go for any contest they see on Dr. Linda’s Page, trust me the experience is something you’ll never forget.  I could remember I started my Instagram account with just 30 followers but by the fact that I won the travel trip, and traveling to Jordan, my Instagram followers had increased.  I get messages from different people from different places like that experience is not something you’ll want to miss, you get to meet with different people from different background, cultures, and get more  knowledgeable listening go their wealth of experience. And all you have to do is put your best into every contest you see, because every contest opens the door to lots of opportunities.” She said. While describing her experience, Mary who said traveling to Jordan was both her first flight experience and international said she was awe-struck when it snowed. “ One of the remarkable things that happened in Jordan was that when we stood out for the first time it snowed, our tour guy was like that we were very lucky because it was like we never expected that it was going to snow in Jordan. It was something I never expected. I haven’t seen snow before but there I was getting to feel it, to touch it, and I saw myself the clogged of ice.” While appreciating Dr. Linda and Vantage Migration Team, Mary spoke about the international opportunity the company benevolently bestowed on her.  “Well all I want to say to Dr. Linda and Vantage Migration team. Thank you so much for the great opportunity. Thank you for opening my eyes to a lot of things especially traveling out of the country, and meeting with different people I met during the trip. It was a lovely experience I would love to have again.
