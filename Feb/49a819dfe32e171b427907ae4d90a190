The federal government says it will investigate the supply of adulterated premium motor spirit (petrol). The development follows serious nationwide concerns of contaminated petrol products in circulation. Timipre Sylva, minister of state for petroleum resources, disclosed this to state house correspondents at the end of the federal executive council meeting on Wednesday in Abuja. According to him, the decision to probe followed a briefing on the issue to President Muhammadu Buhari Tuesday to get to the bottom of the matter. Speaking after the FEC meeting, Sylva cautioned against speculations. He was responding to a question of if the issue was discussed at the council meeting and if the suppliers will be punished. “The issue did not come up in Council, but of course, you will recall I was here yesterday to brief Mr. President on the issue. I’m not in a position to disclose the identities of the companies, but there are some issues, and we are actively tackling it,” Sylva said. “Nobody has, before now, checked for methanol in our fuel, it’s not very usual and this is the first time this is happening, and NNPC is very much up to the task. “I will also convey your question to NNPC and maybe the Midstream and Downstream Regulatory Authority, but we’re actively handling it, and I want to assure you that the problem will be a thing of the past very soon.” He assured that government would consider compensating those who may have been adversely affected by the fuel. On possible sanctions, he stated: “I didn’t expect you to rush to any conclusions. There’ll be a major investigation to unravel everything and then let’s get to the bottom of it before we can come back and tell you what is going to happen to the culprits. “We know that some people’s vehicles must have also been damaged, that is also going to be taken into consideration in dealing with the situation.”
