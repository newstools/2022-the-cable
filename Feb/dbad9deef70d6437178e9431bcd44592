Jose Peseiro, the Portuguese tactician, says a breakdown in negotiations over financial matters and clauses is the reason why his proposed deal with the Nigeria Football Federation (NFF) fell through. Peseiro disclosed this in a post on his verified Instagram account on Tuesday. In December 2021, the NFF had announced the Portuguese as the head coach of the Super Eagles, replacing Gernot Rohr. The federation had said Peseiro would take over the team after the recently concluded Africa Cup of Nations in Cameroon. But on Monday, the NFF reversed the decision and retained Austin Eguavoen as the head of a reconstituted technical crew of the Super Eagles. Speaking on the matter, Peseiro said he “never confirmed” the deal with the NFF “after several weeks of negotiation.” “After several weeks of negotiations, during which there were several news, from the Nigerian Football Federation, that I would be the coach of their team, from the end of the CAN 2021. A fact that I never confirmed, and these did not materialize due to disagreement regarding contractual clauses and financial matters,” the former Porto FC boss said. Super Eagles are billed to take on Ghana for a spot at the Qatar 2022 World Cup later this year. The reverse leg of the encounter will be held on March 27 at the MKO Abiola Stadium, Abuja, while the Ghana Football Association (GFA) is yet to confirm the date of the first leg.
