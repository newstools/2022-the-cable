Nigerian National Petroleum Company (NNPC) Limited says it has distributed 387.59 million litres of premium motor spirit (PMS), also known as petrol, to close the supply gap of the product. NNPC said this in its weekly national PMS evacuation report for February 14 to February 16, released on Wednesday. The Nigerian Midstream and Downstream Petroleum Regulatory Authority (NMDPRA) had confirmed the importation of petrol with methanol quantities. The development caused long queues across major cities as many filling stations shut down services to contain the spread of adulterated petrol. According to the report, NNPC said an average daily distribution for the last week was 55.4 million litres. Furthermore, the report showed that 80 percent of all the evacuations took place at the top 20 high loading depots, while 20 percent took place at the other loading depots. NNPC said the top 20 high load-out depots used were Pinnacle-Lekki, which evacuated 70.8 million litres; NIPCO, which evacuated 22.6 million litres; and AITEO, 22.3 million litres. It listed other top high-loading depots to include Swift, which evacuated 16 million litres, 11 Plc with 15.9 million litres, Bovas Bulk with 15 million litres, and Frado with 14.6 million litres. Others include Keonamex, distributed 13.7 million litres; MRS Ltd, 11.9 million litres; Rainoil, 11.6 million litres; AYM Shafa, 11.2 million litres; and TSL, 11.2 million litres. Rainoil Lagos evacuated 11.2 million litres; Matrix, 10 million litres; Conoil Lagos, 9.7 million litres; AA Rano, 8.8 million litres; Bluefin, 8.4 million litres; HOGL, 8.2 million litres; Ibafon Calabar, 8 million litres; and Mainland, 7.5 million litres. On the other hand, the oil company said an average daily volume of 58.8 million litres were evacuated from January 31 to February 6, while 49.5 million litres were evacuated from February 7 to February 13. Mele Kyari, group managing director of the NNPC Limited, had apologised to Nigerians over the importation of the off-spec PMS, causing a shortage in distribution.
