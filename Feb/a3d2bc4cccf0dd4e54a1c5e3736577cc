Babagana Zulum, governor of Borno, says he is sure about the sincerity of repentant insurgents. Zulum spoke on Wednesday while addressing state house correspondents after the inauguration of the presidential committee on the repatriation, return, and resettlement of internally displaced persons (IDPs) in the north-east. The inauguration of the committee took place at the presidential villa in Abuja. The military had, in 2016, launched operation Safe Corridor, an initiative for the deradicalisation and rehabilitation of ex-insurgents. The aim of the operation is to reintegrate repentant insurgents into society, and more than 500 persons are said to have completed the programme. As of November 2021, the Nigerian Army had said over 17,000 insurgents had surrendered to troops. Speaking on the deradicalisation programme, Zulum said it has yielded positive results. When asked if he was confident that the repentant insurgents are sincere about their intentions, the Borno governor said: “100 percent confident”. “While there is no any process that is perfect in the entire world, so far, so good, the process has yielded positive results,” he added. “I believe that over 90 percent of those that have surrendered are doing well and have given the government the necessary support. They’re also calling their colleagues in the bush to come out and join the process of peacebuilding.” Meanwhile, in March 2021, Zulum had said the rehabilitation of repentant insurgents needs to be reviewed as some of them act as spies. Also, in July 2020, some Borno residents had kicked against the reintegration of repentant insurgents into their communities.
