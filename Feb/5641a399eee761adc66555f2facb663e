Oando Plc, an oil marketer, says it did not import or supply ‘adulterated’ Premium Motor Spirit (PMS). The Nigerian Midstream and Downstream Petroleum Regulatory Authority (NMDPRA), the regulator, confirmed that petrol, with methanol quantities above Nigeria’s specification, was discovered in the supply chain. The development led to long queues across Lagos and Abuja as many filling stations shut down services and customers waited long hours to fill up their tanks. On Wednesday, Mele Kyari, group managing director of the Nigerian National Petroleum Company (NNPC) Limited, had listed Oando among suppliers that imported PMS cargoes with methanol-blended petrol into the country. However, Oando countered the claim in a statement issued on Thursday, saying PMS supplied by its company met Nigeria’s import specifications. “Following media reports listing Oando as one of four importers that supplied methanol-blended Premium Motor Spirits (PMS) into the country, we hereby state that Oando did not import and supply PMS that was adulterated or substandard,” the statement reads. “PMS supplied by Oando met Nigeria’s import specification. “We are committed to working assiduously with the NNPC and industry to identify the root cause(s) of the subsequent contamination of the PMS supplied. “We want to assure the public that Oando as a responsible corporate citizen would not partake in the importation, distribution, or marketing of substandard petroleum products.”
