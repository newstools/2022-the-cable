The Green Alliance, a coalition group, has asked Godwin Emefiele, governor of the Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN), to contest for the 2023 presidency. Speaking during a press conference in Lagos on Saturday, Wale Fapounda, convener of the group, said the country needs a technocrat that can handle the affairs of the country. The group added that the CBN governor understands global economic growth and would compel him to accede to its request to run for the presidency under the All Progressives Congress (APC). <img class="alignnone wp-image-661898 size-large" src="https://f5p3e9e4.stackpathcdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/IMG_20220212_133151-1024x602.jpg" alt="" width="900" height="529" srcset="https://f5p3e9e4.stackpathcdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/IMG_20220212_133151-1024x602.jpg 1024w, https://f5p3e9e4.stackpathcdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/IMG_20220212_133151-300x176.jpg 300w, https://f5p3e9e4.stackpathcdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/IMG_20220212_133151-768x452.jpg 768w, https://f5p3e9e4.stackpathcdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/IMG_20220212_133151-1536x904.jpg 1536w, https://f5p3e9e4.stackpathcdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/IMG_20220212_133151-2048x1205.jpg 2048w, https://f5p3e9e4.stackpathcdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/IMG_20220212_133151-24x14.jpg 24w, https://f5p3e9e4.stackpathcdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/IMG_20220212_133151-36x21.jpg 36w, https://f5p3e9e4.stackpathcdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/IMG_20220212_133151-48x28.jpg 48w" sizes="(max-width: 900px) 100vw, 900px" /> “This forum has come together to come and plead and beg Dr. Godwin Emefiele to run as president of Nigeria in 2023,” Fapounda said. “Since he was appointed the governor of the CBN he has spent his energy in building a resilient financial system that can serve the growth and development needs of the Nigerian economy. A typical example of this was seen during his first term, he supervised an interventionist currency policy at the behest of the presidency, propping up the Nigerian Naira by pumping billions of dollars into the foreign exchange market. “He also introduced a multiple exchange rate regime to try to mask pressure on the Naira and avoid a series of devaluations. He has engineered bank policies and programmes that has supported job creation and fostered inclusive growth, in addition to key macro economic concerns such as inflation and exchange rate stability “He has come up with new strategies to navigate the Nigerian economy through hurdles such as the challenge of foreign exchange inflow, the exchange rate, the economic recession, stagflation, financial inclusion and the rise in the value chain of majority of crops in Nigeria. “Ladies and gentlemen, join me in echoing Emiefele RUN! RUN!! RUN!!!” Fapounda added that if not for how Emefiele managed the economy during the COVID-19 lockdown, Nigeria would have gone the way of Zimbabwe and Venezuela.
