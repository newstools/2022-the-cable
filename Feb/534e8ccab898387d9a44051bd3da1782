One person was reportedly killed on Saturday following a clash between some supporters of Sunday Adeyemo, a ‘Yoruba nation’ agitator better known as Sunday Igboho, and suspected thugs. Yomi Alliyu (SAN), Igboho’s lawyer, confirmed the development to TheCable. He said details of the incident were still not clear, but added that it was an attack that took place in Oyo on Saturday afternoon. “From what I heard, one person was killed in the attack and one person was injured,” he said. “The attack was carried out by members of road transport workers. It happened this afternoon.” Meanwhile, Igboho has been in detention in Benin Republic since he was arrested at an airport in Cotonou by security operatives while on his way to Germany in July 2021. He was arrested shortly after the Nigerian government declared him wanted following a raid by operatives of the Department of State Services (DSS) on his residence. A Beninese court had also blocked the extradition of Igboho to Nigeria, ruling that the activist be remanded in prison pending further hearing. On February 7, 2022, Alliyu had said contrary to speculations that his client would soon be released, the latter’s detention period in Benin Republic has been extended by six months. “Contrary to what was speculated in the news by a lawyer, the government of the Republic de Benin has renewed the incarceration of chief Sunday Adeyemo a.k.a. Igboho Oosa for another six months, even though there is no criminal charge in their file in Cotonou and without extradition request from Nigeria,” he had said.
