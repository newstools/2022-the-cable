Attahiru Bafarawa, former governor of Sokoto state, says Aminu Tambuwal, governor of the state, is qualified for the presidential ticket of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP). According to Bafarawa, Tambuwal has the capacity to be president because he has experience in the three arms of government. Bafarawa made this statement during Tambuwal’s consultative meeting in Kebbi state on Tuesday. “Tambuwal was not only a legislator but also a lawyer by profession, meaning that he fits into the judiciary and at the same time, today he is a sitting governor serving his second term,” he said. “This is to tell you that Tambuwal fits into all the three arms of government. Therefore, he is more credible for the presidential ticket. “That is why we are here to take him to where we want him to be, not where he wants to be.”
