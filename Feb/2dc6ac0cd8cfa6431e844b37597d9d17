Rauf Aregbesola, minister of interior, has lost his ward to Gboyega Oyetola, the incumbent governor of Osun, at the ongoing governorship primary election of the All Progressives Congress (APC). Oyetola polled 309 votes at ward 8, Ifofin, Ilesha east, while Moshood Adeoti, the Aregbesola’s anointed aspirant, scored 146 votes. Saheed Adegoke, leader of Aregbesola’s loyalists at the ward, told journalists that the minister was not around to cast his vote for the exercise. He said Aregbesola went for a presidential assignment. TheCable had reported that some APC members loyal to Aregbesola alleged removal of their names from the party’s register. The party members claimed that despite having the party’s membership cards, their names were missing on the register at the wards for the primary election. The Osun APC has been divided into two major factions — a development that has created disharmony in the party. A faction of the party known as the Ileri Oluwa group is loyal to Gboyega Oyetola, the incumbent governor of Osun, who is also contesting for a second term ticket. The other faction — TOP — loyal to Aregbesola is supporting Adeoti, a former secretary to the state government.
