Ahead of its national convention billed for March 26, the All Progressives Congress (APC) has finally set the ball rolling by zoning party positions. Speaking with reporters on Tuesday after President Muhammadu Buhari held a meeting with APC governors, Nasir el-Rufai, Kaduna governor, said the northern zone would have the positions the southern zone held before. El-Rufai said all the APC governors and the president are on the same page as regards the zoning formula. “We have agreed to a zoning formula for all the six geo-political zones,” the governor had said. “Essentially, the northern zone will have the positions the south have had in the last eight years. And vice versa. It is a very simple, equitable and fair formula. “We will now go back and consult at the zonal level and look at the positions that are available and the process of the convention preparation we started in earnest. “By the grace of God, on the 26th of March, we would have done our national convention.” Here is how the ruling party zoned its national offices.
