Rochas Okorocha is getting media attention. Not only the gleeful basking that comes with positive coverage that he had expected when he styled himself “Captain Rochas” who is ready to be the “pilot for a new Nigeria” as he formally declared his presidential ambition on Monday. But also scalding reportage scrutinising his alleged involvement in the N2.9billion fraud charges levelled against him by the Economic and Financial Crimes Commission (EFCC). The 17-count charge surfaced just a few hours after he stood before reporters to proclaim himself “not too old to run”. According to the EFCC, the former Imo governor allegedly conspired with others, including a member of the All Progressives Congress (APC) and five companies, to steal N2.9 billion public funds. Aside from Okorocha, other defendants in the case are Anyim Nyerere Chinenye, Naphtali International Limited, Perfect Finish Multi Projects Limited, Consolid Projects Consulting Limited, Pramif International Limited, and Legend World Concepts Limited. In response, Okorocha dismissed the charges as “political propaganda” designed to tarnish his image. He boasted that he had garnered riches long before foraying into politics, adding that he became “poorer” while he was governor of Imo. “I want to say to you that I was Rochas before I became governor; in fact, [being a] governor made me poorer,” he had said. “How much is Imo state government money? Imo state is really owing me because I never collected my security votes. I am supposed to collect N8 billion if I have to make claims for security votes I did not collect.” Okorocha is not new to controversies that beam negative media reportage on him. In fact, since his departure from the Imo state government house, controversy has trailed him like an ants stalk sugar. <img class="size-full wp-image-137641" src="https://f5p3e9e4.stackpathcdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/Rochas-Okorocha-1-1-1-1-1-1-1.jpg" alt="" width="670" height="445" srcset="https://f5p3e9e4.stackpathcdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/Rochas-Okorocha-1-1-1-1-1-1-1.jpg 670w, https://f5p3e9e4.stackpathcdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/Rochas-Okorocha-1-1-1-1-1-1-1-300x199.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 670px) 100vw, 670px" /> IBERIBERISM In a chat with Channels TV in 2019, Okorocha pulled on the cap of an etymologist and the pen of a lexicographer — and minted a new English word. “Iberiberism,” he called it while claiming it can be found in English language dictionaries. “Why do we fight corruption? I’ll rather prevent corruption than fight it. That’s one that my party [APC] should look into. Because people are getting away with corruption on the basis that they can perfect their paperwork,” he said. “But if you come to Imo, and I’ve collected N500billion, and I can only show you boreholes and renovation of schools, and I can tidy them up. It’s what I call Iberiberism. “Go and search for it. It’s an English word. Go and check the dictionary for it. Iberiberism means foolishness.” The newly-fangled word earned Okorocha some attention with the press and on social media, where he became the subject of memes for a while. ERECTING OF STATUES Towards the twilight of his tenure as the governor of Imo state, Okorocha embarked on a spree of statue erections to “preserve history which is dying in Africa”. Within a few months, he unveiled giant-sized bronze statues of Jacob Zuma, Sirleaf Johnson, Kwame Nkrumah, Olusegun Obasanjo, Nnamdi Azikiwe, Martin Luther King Jnr, Alex Ekwueme, among others. Outrage trailed the unveiling — particularly of Zuma who was facing corruption allegations in South Africa. In defence, Okorocha said he splurged N530 million to immortalise the African icons “so that children yet unborn can know about them”. “I erect statues to immortalise people so that children yet unborn can know about them. History is dying in Africa. We must keep it alive,” he said. “In the next 100 years, most of us would not be alive, but this will stand for children to see. If leaders are not immortalised, there will be no history for children.” <img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-338800" src="https://f5p3e9e4.stackpathcdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/Okorocha-1.jpg" alt="" width="680" height="453" srcset="https://f5p3e9e4.stackpathcdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/Okorocha-1.jpg 680w, https://f5p3e9e4.stackpathcdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/Okorocha-1-300x200.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /> MINISTRY OF HAPPINESS In 2017, while he was still facing fierce criticism for his statues erecting move, Okorocha gave his detractors yet another rope to hang him with. He created the ministry of happiness and purpose fulfilment for the people of Imo and appointed Ogechi Ololo, his sister, as the pioneer commissioner. The announcement was greeted with loads of mockery on social media after the initial name of the ministry was erroneously printed as “ministry of happiness and couple fulfilment”. People were perplexed at the function of the new ministry and why it was needed, and Okorocha, as usual, had the answers ready. “The real essence of life is to be happy and to fulfil one’s purpose in life. Government officials are elected to address this,” he has said in a statement released by Sam Onwueomedo, his spokesperson. “This is the very reason people elect their leaders to guarantee their happiness and purpose fulfilment. A great leader, therefore, is one who provides happiness to the people.” POWER TUSSLE WITH HOPE UZODINMA Since leaving office as the governor of Imo in 2019, Okorocha has been at loggerheads with Hope Uzodinma, his successor. The duo had over the past months traded libellous and unsavoury comments and allegations. The verbal scuffle reached a crescendo last December when Uche Nwosu, Okorocha’s in-law and his anointed candidate for the 2019 Imo gubernatorial election, was arrested by security operatives during a church thanksgiving service in honour of his late mother, Jemaimah Nwosu, who was laid to rest just a few days before. Witnesses had earlier described the arrest as an abduction until the police announced its involvement later in the day. In reaction, Okorocha said the incident was “like a kidnap”. He added that his son-in-law’s arrest has “unravelled” the “mystery” behind unknown gunmen in Imo. <img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-372185" src="https://f5p3e9e4.stackpathcdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/Okorocha-1.jpg" alt="" width="700" height="467" srcset="https://f5p3e9e4.stackpathcdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/Okorocha-1.jpg 700w, https://f5p3e9e4.stackpathcdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/Okorocha-1-300x200.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 700px) 100vw, 700px" /> PRESIDENTIAL BID In 2021, it became clear that Okorocha might have his eyes fixed on the presidency. Coalitions across the country began clamouring for him to declare his interest in the 2023 presidential election. According to the proponents of his candidacy, he “remains the best ticket that can guarantee the Igbo’s push for the presidency in 2023”. During a plenary session in January 2022, Okorocha, in what appeared to be acceding to the request, announced his intention to run for president. A few days later, he formally declared his bid to reporters in Abuja. Okorocha said his ambition is inspired by the need to establish a “new Nigeria” where issues of poverty and security will be addressed. “I am not in politics for what I can get. I am in politics for what I can give. I price honour more than life and glory more than wealth,” he had said. In a chat with Arise TV on Tuesday, he said his background as a “businessman” would help to solve Nigeria’s wealth creation problems. “Nigeria has so many problems than the available money can solve. We need to create wealth, that’s why I said that we need a businessman. Don’t allow yourself to be deceived by anybody who doesn’t know how to make wealth,” the former Imo governor said. “Aspiration is not the issue of grammar or technicalities. It’s the ability to make wealth. We need business ideas to run this country.” Now that he’s saddled with not only the rigour of being a presidential hopeful but also a suspect in a fraud case, how Okorocha will juggle the two burdens is something that requires pondering.
