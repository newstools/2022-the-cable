The Ogun police command says it has arrested a couple found with human body parts in Abeokuta, the state capital. Abimbola Oyeyemi, police spokesperson in the state, disclosed the development in a statement on Saturday. Oyeyemi said the couple, identified as 43-year-old Kehinde Oladimeji and  35-year-old Adejumoke Raji, were arrested at MKO Abiola way in Leme area of Abeokuta. According to him, the case was reported to the Kemta divisional headquarters by Moshood Ogunwolu, the Baale of Leme community. The community leader was said to have reported that one Adisa Olarewaju, a pastor in the area, allegedly perceived a stench from the room of the suspects. “Upon the complaint, the DPO Kemta division, CSP Adeniyi Adekunle, quickly led his detectives to the scene where search was conducted. On searching the room, a plastic bowl containing fresh different parts of human being was discovered in the room, and the couple was promptly arrested,” the statement reads. “On interrogation, the suspects confessed they were herbalists and that the human parts comprised hands, breasts and other parts that were given to them by one Michael who they claimed resided in Adatan area of Abeokuta. “All efforts to locate the said Michael proved abortive as the suspects could not locate his house. “It will be recalled that a dismembered body of an unknown person was found in a swampy area at Leme area of Abeokuta about a week ago. It is not yet clear whether the parts are that of the found body or not.” According to to the statement, Lanre Bankole, Ogun commissioner of police, had directed that the suspects be transferred to homicide section of the state criminal investigation and intelligence department for further investigation.
