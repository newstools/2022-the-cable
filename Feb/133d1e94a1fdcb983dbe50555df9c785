The National Broadcasting Commission (NBC) has imposed a N5 million fine on Vision FM, a radio station, for “discussing appointments” at the National Intelligence Agency (NIA). The commission also suspended ‘Idon Mikiya’, a current affairs programme on which the “discussion” took place, for six months. The programme reportedly aired on January 5. In a letter addressed to the management of the radio station, Balarabe Shehu Ilelah, NBC director-general, said the programme breached 39(3)(b) of the country’s constitution. Ilelah said the programme is “prejudicial to national security”. “Your discussion on the issue, including appointments at the National Intelligence Agency (NIA), constitutes a breach of the provision of section 39(3)(b) of the 1999 constitution of the Federal Republic of Nigeria, which imposes restrictions on matters concerning government security services or agencies established by law,” the director-general said. “Transmitting the trade secrets or other issues regarding a national security agency amounts to an act prejudicial to national security contrary to the above section cited. “Recall that the commission has invited the management of Vision FM severally bothering on issues of balance, fairness and presenter bearing opinion, which are violations of the following sections of the Nigeria Broadcasting Code.”
