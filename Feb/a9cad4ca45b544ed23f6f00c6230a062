Iyorchia Ayu, national chairman of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP), says Nigeria can learn from China’s model of industrialisation. According to a statement issued by Debo Ologunagba, PDP spokesperson, Ayu spoke on Friday when he received a delegation from the Communist Party of China (CPC) at the party’s headquarters in Abuja. Ayu reportedly said when the opposition party regains power in 2023, Nigeria will “deepen and broaden” economic cooperation with China. “There is much that Nigeria can learn from China, especially its model of industrialisation,” Ayu was quoted as saying. “This is a country that has suffered colonial abuse. It also has a large population and a chequered history like Nigeria. But it has risen from 100 years of humiliation to become an industrial giant and arguably the biggest economy in the world. “The CPC has largely eradicated poverty in China and touched lives even in the remotest areas of the country. The PDP is determined to also eradicate poverty in the country and generally improve the quality of life of the average Nigerian. “When we return to power in 2023, we will deepen and broaden the cooperation between our country and yours. The Chinese are industrial leaders and we want our people to tap into that industrial energy. We want a partnership that benefits our people too. We do not want a one-sided relationship.” Speaking earlier, Wu Baocai, leader of the delegation, was quoted as saying CPC opened its party office in the Chinese Embassy in Nigeria four months ago owing to Nigeria’s growing importance in world affairs and the need to strengthen political ties.
