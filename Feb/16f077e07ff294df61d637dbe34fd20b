Roman Abramovich, Chelsea owner, has stepped down from managing the affairs of the club after about 20 years in charge. The Russian billionaire businessman broke the news in statement released via the club’s website on Saturday. According to him, trustees of Chelsea’s charitable foundation would henceforth be responsible for the stewardship and care of the club. The politician also said the decision was “taken in the club’s interest”, adding that trustees of Chelsea’s foundation “are in the best position to look after the interests of the club, players, staff, and fans.” “During my nearly 20-year ownership of Chelsea FC, I have always viewed my role as a custodian of the Club, whose job it is ensuring that we are as successful as we can be today, as well as build for the future, while also playing a positive role in our communities,” the statement read. “I have always taken decisions with the Club’s best interest at heart. I remain committed to these values. That is why I am today giving trustees of Chelsea’s charitable Foundation the stewardship and care of Chelsea FC. “I believe that currently they are in the best position to look after the interests of the Club, players, staff, and fans.” Although he did not state any reason for his decision, the move comes amid his continued link to Vladimir Putin, Russia president. Putin has been in the public eye after he ordered Russian troops to invade Ukraine as face-off between the two countries deepens. Abramovich became Chelsea owner in 2003. He has won nearly 18 major trophies with the club.
