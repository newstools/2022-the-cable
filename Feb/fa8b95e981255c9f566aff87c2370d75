After a wonderful weekend of football activities and some outstanding performances, TheCable picks the best Nigerian XI. Maduka Okoye – Sparta Rotterdam He stopped everything thrown at him and was always well placed to help Sparta Rotterdam keep a clean sheet. Unbeatable. Michael Ihiekwe – Rotherham United Ihiekwe was a steady influence at the back and played his part in keeping Rotherham solid. Sturdy. Anthony Izuchukwu – Hapoel Haifa He did well with his tackles, clearances, interceptions. It was also a busy day for the defender who was a stalwart for his team in their weekend game. Acerbic. Kenneth Omeruo – Leganes Omeruo was always alert and made a number of winning interventions for his team. Attentive. Zaidu Sanusi – FC Porto Another world-class performance from the full back. Sanusi was a nuisance from start to finish against Sporting CP. Mercurial. Innocent Bonke – Lorient Bonke was at his best with a brilliant performance for Lorient who drew 0-0 against Monaco. Superb. Alex Iwobi – Everton Iwobi caused problems from the start of the match against Leeds United. He had an exceptional game. Electric. Moses Simon – Nantes The man of the match was hardworking while scoring with a sweet free kick from outside the box. His work rate and precise passes left the visitors in apparent disarray. Stunning. Blessing Eleke – Genclerbirligi As always a thoroughbred, he consistently hassled the defence within and without. Scored a superb and well deserved goal with absolute ease. Accomplished. Paul Onuachu – Genk The ex Midtjylland star grabbed a goal for his team and stuck out like a pair of patent leather shoes at a hoedown with his dazzling footwork. He also had a strong effort towards goal blocked. Stunning. Sadiq Umar – Almeria A superb performance saw him hit the target for the visitors who won at Malaga. Outstanding.
