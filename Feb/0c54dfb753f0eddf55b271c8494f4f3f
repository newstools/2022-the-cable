A federal high court in Abuja has struck out a criminal charge filed against Ikedi Ohakim, former governor of Imo state. The inspector-general of police had preferred a five-count charge against Ohakim and one Chinedu Okpareke, following a petition by one Chinyere Amuchienwa who accused both men of harassment and threatening to release her nude photos. Although the police had filed an application seeking to withdraw the charges against Ohakim and Okpareke, the office of the attorney-general of the federation expressed interest in taking over the prosecution of the case. The AGF’s application was granted by the court on September 27. The case has suffered several adjournments since that time. At the court session on Friday, Sani Bagudu, counsel from the office of the AGF, applied to withdraw the matter to enable the AGF to study the case file and take appropriate action. Thursday’s sitting, which was meant for the arraignment of the two defendants, was stalled following the request. Consequently, Taiwo Taiwo, the trial judge, made an order striking out the case.
