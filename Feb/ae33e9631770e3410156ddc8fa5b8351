A federal high court in Abuja has refused to hear an application by Abba Kyari, the suspended deputy commissioner of police (DCP), seeking bail from the custody of the National Drug Law Enforcement Agency (NDLEA). In an ex parte application brought before the court on Monday, Kyari through his counsel, Cynthia Ikenna, told the court that his health has deteriorated. Ikenna asked the court to release her client who is diabetic and hypertensive on bail, pending the determination of the substantive suit. She said the substantive matter is a fundamental human right suit in which Kyari is challenging the allegations against him. However, Inyang Ekwo, the judge, ordered the applicant to put the respondents on notice. “Upon studying the process of the applicant and the averments in support of the application, I am of the opinion that the respondents be put on notice so they can answer to the averments. Therefore, applicant is hereby ordered to put the respondents on notice of all the processes in this matter,” he held. He adjourned the matter till Thursday for hearing of the application. On February 14, the NDLEA declared Kyari wanted “over his involvement in a 25kg cocaine deal”. Hours later, the police announced his arrest and subsequent transfer to the custody of the NDLEA. The NDLEA’s revelation comes months after the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) indicted Kyari of conspiring with Hushpuppi, self-confessed international fraudster, in a $1.1 million scam targeting Qatari business people. The FBI secured a court order for Kyari’s extradition and arrest over his alleged involvement in the Hushpuppi fraud.
