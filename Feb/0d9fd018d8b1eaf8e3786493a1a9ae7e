A federal high court has fixed February 18 for the arraignment of Olanrewaju Suraju, HEDA Resource Centre chairman, on charges relating to forgery. In a suit marked FHC/ABJ/CR/370/21, Suraju is charged with cyberstalking for allegedly circulating the fake audio of a phone interview said to have been planted to implicate Mohammed Bello Adoke, former attorney-general of the federation (AGF), in the OPL 245 saga. At the court session on Monday which was initially scheduled for the defendant’s arraignment, Y.A Cole, prosecution counsel, told the court that the director of public prosecution (DPP) has recalled the case file for a review. She said the proof of evidence as well as their counter to the defendant’s preliminary objection has been filed and served as earlier directed by the court. “The director of public prosecution has called for the file for a review of the case in the last three days,” she said. “My lord, I plead for a short adjournment to give the DPP enough time to review the case.” She apologised to the court and defendant for the delay. Responding, Muiz Banire, Suraju’s counsel, opposed the application for an adjournment. He prayed that the matter be struck out for want of diligent prosecution. “My application is that the matter be struck out and when they are ready, we come back. We can’t keep risking our lives coming all the way from Lagos,” he said. In a short ruling, Binta Nyako, the judge, said this is the last chance she would give to the prosecution. “Next time you are not ready, I’ll strike out the charge,” the judge held. The case has been adjourned till February 18 for arraignment. This is the third time the arraignment has been stalled.
