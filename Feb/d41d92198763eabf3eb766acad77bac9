Nigeria took a huge step to qualifying for the 2022 Africa Women’s Cup of Nations (AWCON) by defeating Cote d’Ivoire 2-0 at the Moshood Abiola Stadium on Friday afternoon. A brace from Gotham FC striker Ifeoma Onumonu helped the Randy Waldrum side win the first leg of the encounter in Abuja. The Ivorians bombarded the Super Falcons with their physical flavour. They almost drew the first blood but goalkeeper Chiamaka Nnadozie was at alert with some smart saves. Falcons who started the game slowly were forced to up the ante and they were in front from a counter attack on 21 minutes. French based Esther Okoronkwo set up Onumonu inside the box and the striker showed gratitude with a sweet finish. Nnadozie helped Falcons protect their precious lead with her usual teasers behind the sticks. The reigning African champions had a slim lead at halftime, thanks to Onumonu’s effort. In the 51st minute, Michelle Alozie was at alert to make a brilliant defensive clearance while Nnadozie produced another top save. Five minutes later, Onumonu bagged a brace as she lobbed the ball over the Ivorian goalkeeper to double the Super Falcons’ lead, thus winning the game. The Super Falcons and the Lady Elephants are expected to play the second leg of the encounter inside the Stade Robert Champroux in Abidjan next Wednesday. The 12th Women AFCON finals, which hold in Morocco between July 2 and 23, 2022, will see all four semi-finalists qualify for the 2023 FIFA Women’s World Cup, to be co-hosted by Australia and New Zealand. It is the first Women’s World Cup to entertain 32 teams – same number as the men’s tournament.
