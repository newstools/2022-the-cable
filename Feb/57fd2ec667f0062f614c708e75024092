A keyword internet search by TheCable gave no result on where or when he made the statement, and none of the users who posted the quotes indicated their source(s). When TheCable contacted Valentine Obienyem, Obi’s spokesperson, he said his principal did not make the viral statement. “Not at all! Oga did not say such a thing. It’s political opponents that are putting up such propaganda,” Obienyem said. VERDICT There is no evidence that Peter Obi said APC is a Yoruba political party.
