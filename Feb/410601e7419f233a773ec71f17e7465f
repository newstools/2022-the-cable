President Muhammadu Buhari says the era of the military taking over government is gone for good in Nigeria. Buhari was responding to concerns raised by Kayode Fayemi, governor of Ekiti state, on the recent resurgence of military takeovers in Mali, Guinea and Burkina Faso in August 2020, September 2021 and January 2022, respectively. According to a statement by Femi Adesina, presidential spokesman, Buhari spoke on Sunday at a dinner in honour of the 2022 committee of business, political, media and civil society leaders in Abuja. Buhari said he strongly believes that ‘‘Nigeria has passed through that stage for good”. The president said he was looking forward to completing his tenure and leaving a legacy for a united, peaceful, and prosperous Nigeria with 24 years of uninterrupted democracy. He assured Nigerians that his administration will finish strong in the last lap of his tenure. Buhari said: ”I am gradually entering my final year in office. It is a period I intend to spend not only on consolidating on the achievements of the past seven years but also to leave a legacy for a united, peaceful, and prosperous Nigeria. ”It is our desire to finish strong in the next 16 months and ensure all hands are on deck for the last lap. We are doubling our efforts against all forms of insecurity, equipping our armed forces and strengthening the police. ”We are determined to continue the war against corruption and fight poverty, we remain focused on building an all-inclusive economic opportunity for all citizens.”
