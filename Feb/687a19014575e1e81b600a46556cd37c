Pat Utomi, a professor of political economy, says Nigeria does not need someone who wants to become the president just because he is wealthy. Speaking on Sunday during an interview with the News Agency of Nigeria (NAN), Utomi said the country needs a selfless and intellectual leader to succeed President Muhammadu Buhari in 2023. Utomi, a former presidential candidate on the platform of the African Democratic Congress (ADC), noted that a coalition that will change the country in 2023 will soon be unveiled. “Nigerians need a person of competence and compassion, someone who is very selfless and a pan-Nigerian nationalist with a track record of a life service,” Utomi said. “Not somebody who spends his life just thinking about himself and suddenly decides that okay I have enough money I can now lead them. “We need a true Nigerian accepted in all parts of the country, exposed to all parts of the country in the reality of his life not in talks and the person must have friends in every part of Nigeria. We need a person, who is interested in collegial leadership. “The prospect of a coalition that will change Nigeria, which I envisage, and is being put together as we speak, is a coalition of the youth, the women, the intellectuals and the professionals.” On whether he has the desire to contest for the presidency in 2023, Utomi said, “It is not a criminal offence. We will cross that bridge when we get there.” “Our commitment is to a better society. I don’t need a title to make a contribution to the betterment of my country. If it then turnouts that a title drops itself in, well, so be it, but I don’t need a title to make a difference to my country’s history. “My heart goes out to the youths of Nigeria, they have been most abused by politicians. In spite of everything this country has done to them, the promise remains very high and the possibilities of the demographic dividends coming to Nigeria from our intelligent youths is very high.”
