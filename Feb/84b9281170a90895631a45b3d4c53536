The Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) has named a seven-member electoral committee to conduct its state congress in Lagos. Diri Douye, governor of Bayelsa state, is the chairman of the committee, with Gabriel Onyeweife serving as the secretary. Other members of the committee are Erelu Olusola Obada, former deputy governor of Osun; Sarkin Bello, Awwal Tukur, Peter Atofarati and Peter Orji. The exercise is scheduled for February 27 in Ikeja, the capital of Lagos. In a statement issued on Friday, Debo Ologunagba, national publicity secretary of the PDP, said “all aspirants, leaders and critical stakeholders of the party” should be guided by the notice. The exercise was supposed to take place last Wednesday, but it was postponed. The PDP spokesperson said the new date was approved by the national working committee (NWC) of the party. The PDP’s membership in Lagos got a boost in January when Iyorchia Ayu, the party’s national chairman, received some members of the Lagos4Lagos movement, which was formerly associated with the All Progressives Congress (APC).
