A federal high court in Abuja has ordered the interim forfeiture of a property “linked” to Rochas Okorocha, senator representing Imo west. According to a statement by the Economic and Financial Crimes Commission (EFCC), the property situated at plot 1032 and 1033, Cadastral Zone AO3, Takum close, off Michika street, Ahmadu Bello way, Garki, Abuja, is “reasonably suspected to be proceeds of unlawful activities”. In a motion ex parte pursuant to section 44(2) of the constitution of the federal republic of Nigeria, 1999 (as amended), and section 17 of the Advance Fee Fraud and Other Fraud Related Offences Act No. 14 2006, the EFCC prayed the court for an order of forfeiture on the property on the grounds that it was acquired illegally. The commission also said its investigation revealed that Abtisal Global Ltd and Archivisual Solution Ltd, firms in which Okorocha is alleged to be involved with, got N222,000,000 from the Imo state government treasury sometime in 2018 to develop and upgrade the property. Emeka Nwite, the presiding judge, granted the commission’s request. In the ruling, Nwite directed that the interim forfeiture order be published in the national dailies to alert anyone with interest in the property to show cause why it should not be permanently forfeited to the federal government of Nigeria. The judge, thereafter, adjourned the matter till April 13, 2022, to hear the motion for final forfeiture of the property. The development comes weeks after the EFCC filed a 17-count charge against Okorocha, alleging that he conspired with others, including a member of the All Progressives Congress (APC) and five companies, to steal N2.9 billion public funds. But speaking on the development, the senator, who recently declared his intention to run for president in 2023, said the charges are “trumped up to distract him”.
