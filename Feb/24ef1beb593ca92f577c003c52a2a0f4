The committee is to ascertain the total inventory, assets, interests and liabilities of NNPC in line with the Petroleum Industry Act (PIA). Chima said the committee had asked the NNPC to tender its yearly audited reports to verify with the Nigeria Extractive Industries Transparency Initiative (NEITI) report. He added that the oil and gas industry had been plagued with corruption, mismanagement, crisis, environmental degradation, lack of refining capacity, among others. “We requested for detailed information on NNPC assets, interests, liabilities and up-to-date audited reports from the CEO of NNPC Ltd,” Chima said. “The decision of the House is in sync with the provisions of sections 88 and 89 of the 1999 constitution of the Federal Republic of Nigeria (as amended).
