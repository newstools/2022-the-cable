Paradigm Initiative (PIN) says it will host a series of digital rights advocacy sessions in 10 African countries. The advocacy session is tagged “Digi-Talks”. Paradigm initiative is a pan-African social enterprise that works to connect underserved young Africans with digital opportunities and ensures the protection of their rights. In a statement issued on Friday, Valery Njiaba, communications officer, PIN, said the group aims to use its short film Focus, a visual representation of its 2020 annual report called LONDA. The statement added that advocacy would feature the screening of Focus, a look at the findings of the LONDA report; an open conversation on the state of digital rights and inclusion; questions and answers; and debates aimed at enhancing digital rights in all the host countries. Njiaba also said that the Digi-Talks with Focus would run between February 15 and March 7, 2022, in Cameroon, Malawi, Kenya, Uganda, the Democratic Republic of Congo, Zimbabwe, Namibia, Ghana, Tanzania and Zambia. “PIN will convene these sessions with local partners in each country, bringing together diverse audiences over half a day,” Njiaba said. “It would highlight digital rights and inclusion infractions in 20 African countries. “The sessions will also provide opportunities for engaging conversations and make key recommendations to enhance digital rights on the continent. “To enhance digital rights and combat online violations in Africa, PIN will be presenting its tools of impact such as ripoti.africa — a platform that enables online users to report digital rights violations in Africa.” According to him, this includes breaches of online privacy and ayeta.africa, a toolkit for African digital rights actors.
