Ahead of the 2023 presidential election, a group known as the Osinbajo campaign organisation has launched in Ondo state to support the vice-president. The vice-president has not officially declared to contest in the 2023 presidential election. At its launching on Saturday, in Akure, Ondo state capital, Ifeolu Fasoranti, director-general of the group, said Osinbajo is the right man to succeed President Muhammadu Buhari. Fasoranti said the group was formed for the emergence of the vice-president as the candidate of the All Progressives Congress (APC) and subsequently winner of the 2023 presidential election. He described Osinbajo as the appropriate person to succeed Buhari because “he has the wherewithal to fix the nation’s multifaceted challenges”. He said the vice-president would turn around the socio-economic and political situations of the country if allowed to lead. “We believe that as president, Osinbajo will harness all the resources and rejig the system to work towards the interest of Nigeria rather than the interest of individuals,” he said. “With his vast experiences in the academics, law, governance and administration, Osinbajo has fashioned out many programmes that will effectively address the challenges confronting this nation. “No doubt, he will be a bridge between the old and the new, between the north and the south, between the east and the west. He will be a connecting valve among all religious beliefs.” Fasoranti said without trying to ruffle feathers, the nation needs “an energetic, fearless, truthful, focused leader” with conscience and vision to direct its affairs. He added that prominent leaders have committed to the course.
