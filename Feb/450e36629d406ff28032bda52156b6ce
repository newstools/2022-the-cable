The top four teams at the ongoing 2021-22 edition of the Edo Cricket League are set to take on each other in the super four scheduled to hold between February 12 and 13. The much-awaited phase of the tournament is set to take place at the Edo Boys High School in Benin, the state capital. Teams contesting in the super four include U-17 Cricket Club, the defending champion of the league; Ambrose Alli University (AAU) Cricket Club, current table topper; No Limit as well as Dolphins. The national team quartet of Victor Ipoli, Chiemelie Udekwe and Isesele brothers (Odion and Akere) would also be on parade. Speaking ahead of the event on Thursday, Abraham Oviawe, vice-president of the Edo state cricket association, said the ongoing season has been the best and most competitive. “The high presence of national team players at all levels make Edo Cricket League the toughest in the country. In addition, we have had many skilled players from other parts of the country. We look forward to having new talents prove themselves, as we believe each of the four teams can win the title,” he said. Oviawe commended the state’s sports council for its support as well as the schools for enabling their students to participate in the league. U-17 Cricket Club will face No Limit Cricket Club while Dolphins will take on AAU in the second match of the opening day. Winners of both matches will meet in the final on Sunday.
