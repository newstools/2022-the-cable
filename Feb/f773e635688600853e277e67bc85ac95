The house of representatives is considering a bill seeking to scrap the Nigeria Security and Civil Defence Corps (NSCDC). The legislation proposes to repeal the NSCDC (amendment) Act 2007. The bill seeks to establish a transition management committee to superintend over the agency, develop regulations and implement procedures for the transfer of assets and personnel of the corps to the Nigeria Police Force (NPF). The bill, which has passed first reading, was sponsored by Shina Peller, an All Progressives Congress (APC) lawmaker from Oyo state. Peller said the “fragmentation of security resources across multiple competing agencies is counterproductive”. He said the mandate of the NSCDC has “expanded that it has now become a duplication of the police and has led to avoidable conflicts”. The lawmaker said the duties of the NSCDC are being performed by the police, adding that retaining the former is a “waste of scarce resources”. Peller added that there won’t be job losses as a result of the scrapping as the assets and personnel of the NSCDC will be absorbed by the police.
