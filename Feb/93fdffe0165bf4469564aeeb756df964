Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky has asked the European Union to grant his country “immediate” membership as Russia’s invasion of the country enters its fifth day. “We appeal to the European Union for the immediate accession of Ukraine via a new special procedure,” the president said in a new video address. “Our goal is to be together with all Europeans and, most importantly, to be on an equal footing. I’m sure it’s fair. I’m sure it’s possible.” Zelensky’s demand followed the facilitation of a peace talk between Russia and Ukraine slated to take place on the Ukraine-Belarus border. Evgeny Yenin, Ukraine’s deputy interior minister, said the talks would take place on Monday morning. Zelensky had initially objected to having the meeting in Belarus, pointing out that Russian military actions are being launched from that country. On Sunday, Zelensky said in a televised statement that he does not expect much from the meeting. “I will say frankly, as always: I do not really believe in the result of this meeting, but let them try. So that no citizen of Ukraine would have any doubt that I, as president, did not try to stop the war when there was even a small chance,” Zelensky said. Ukraine has been trying to defend its cities from the military onslaught of Russia since Thursday. Zelensky said 16 children died during the first four days of Russia’s assault and another 45 wounded.
