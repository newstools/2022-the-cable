There is currently heavy security presence at the national secretariat of the All Progressives Congress (APC) in the federal capital territory (FCT). This is a precautionary measure as Mai Mala Buni, chairman of the Caretaker/Extraordinary Convention Planning Committee (CECPC), is billed to inaugurate state chairpersons today. The security agents who took positions on Blantyre street in Wuse 2 where the ruling party’s secretariat is located were seen screening people and vehicles. TheCable learnt that the party invited the police to forestall any protest that may break out during the ceremony. Many of the congresses that produced some of the soon-to-be inaugurated chairpersons were rancorous. There were parallel congresses in some states which produced factional leaders. TheCable had reported that Buni’s rumored resolve not to relinquish control of the party anytime soon is putting the APC’s planned convention scheduled for February 26 in jeopardy. A governor told TheCable that the CECPC chairman is only pursuing the composition of a zoning committee — which is just one of the several panels that need to be in place before the convention is held “Buni is definitely up to something — he wants to inaugurate the state executives this week and we are hearing he wants them to use a voice vote to say he should continue in office… this will only create more friction and confusion,” the governor had said.
