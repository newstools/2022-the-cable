The Federal Road Safety Commission (FRSC) on Sunday said nine persons died in a crash that occurred on the Ilorin- Ogbomoso Road. Jonathan Owoade, FRSC sector commander in Kwara, confirmed the development. He said eight persons were injured in the crash while nine others were confirmed dead. According to the commander, the fatal accident occurred opposite the Ilorin International Airport. Owoade said the accident — which involved a Toyota Corolla car and Toyota Hiace bus — was a result of overspeeding. “The fatal crash happened at about 8.00 a.m., with  20 persons involved. Eight sustained injuries ranging from open wounds to burns and sadly, nine others lost their lives”, he said. “Before we reached the scene of the crash, the injured had been taken to the state general hospital by passersby, while the corpses had been deposited at the University of Ilorin Teaching Hospital mortuary by the patrol team.” “While we wish the injured quick recovery, we are also pleading with motorists to be patient while driving. Pedestrians and other road users too should be conscious and be careful while on the road. “We commiserate with the families of the dead and we pray that the souls of the departed rest well.”
