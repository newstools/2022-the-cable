A faction of the All Progressives Congress (APC) – The Osun Progressives (TOP), loyal to Rauf Aregbesola, minister of interior, says it will appeal the outcome of the governorship primary. A statement signed by Abiodun Agboola, publicity secretary of the faction, quoted the Rasaq Salinsile, TOP chairman, as saying this on Monday during a stakeholders’ meeting held at Oranmiyan House, Osogbo. Salinsile, who described the primary as a “charade”, said the faction would approach the appeal committee to be set up by the national secretariat to seek redress. “We put it on record the fact that there were so many anomalies, all of which incidentally, we had made known before Saturday’s event,” he said. “We put on record that as at the day of the election, alhaji Moshood Adeoti, our governorship aspirant, was not allowed to have access to the membership register by which the exercise took place. “By this, he was denied knowledge of how many members the party had as at the day of the election, which is contrary to morality and the law. “We put on record the fact that many people were disenfranchised as APC members who trooped to the election centres with their membership slips, could not find their names on the register.” Salinsile said “contrary to the guidelines, accreditation did not take place in many election centres, while result sheets were unavailable”. “We are, therefore, convinced that justice has not been served and therefore reject the result and will be approaching the appeal committee to be set up by the national secretariat,” he added.
