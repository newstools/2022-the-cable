Bill Gates, co-chair of the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation (BMGF), says he has written a book on how to prevent future pandemics. In a recent newsletter, Gates said he spent the last two years working with his partners and colleagues at the Gates Foundation to stop COVID-19. He added that the book titled ‘How to Prevent the Next Pandemic’ is about what he learned researching COVID-19 to make sure no one suffers through the misery of the last two years again. “The last two years have caused unbelievable amounts of hardship around the world… whenever I see the suffering that COVID has created — every time I read about the latest death toll or hear about someone who lost their job or drive by a school that is closed — I can’t help but think: We don’t have to do this again,” he said. “COVID has only made it clearer that the world needs to prioritize eliminating pandemics as a threat to humanity. I’ve been following COVID since the early days of the outbreak, working with experts from inside and out of the Gates Foundation who are championing a more equitable response and have been fighting infectious diseases for decades. “I’ve learned a lot in the process — both about this pandemic and how we stop the next one — and I want to share what I’ve heard with people. So, I started writing a book about how we can make sure that no one suffers through a pandemic ever again.” He said that the book, which launches on May 3, 2022, contains a step by step plan, innovations and tools on how to equitably stop pathogens early. He also said that he outlined processes that can be used to provide better healthcare for everyone globally. “In the book, I lay out the specific steps we can take to not only stop future pandemics but, in the process, provide better healthcare for everyone around the world. I outline the lessons we can learn from this pandemic, the innovations we need to save lives, and the new tools we need to stop pathogens early and equitably,” Gates added.
