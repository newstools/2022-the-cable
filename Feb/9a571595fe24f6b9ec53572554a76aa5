A federal high court in Abuja has reversed the N2 million fine imposed against the Nigerian Immigration Service (NIS) over its alleged refusal to release the international passport seized from Peter Odili, former governor of Rivers state. Inyang Ekwo, the presiding judge, had on December 21, 2021, frowned at the continuous absence of the NIS in court and its refusal to comply with an order directing the release of Odili’s travel document. Ekwo awarded a N2 million fine in favour of Odili and ordered the attorney-general of the federation (AGF) to take disciplinary action against Jimoh Adamu, NIS counsel, for his “unprofessional conduct” in the handling of the case. At the court session on Monday, Adamu said Njideka Nwosu-Iheme, Odili’s daughter who is a serving judge of a federal capital territory (FCT) high court, collected the passport for her father on December 20, 2021, at the immigration headquarters in Abuja. He said the immigration service has already filed an appeal challenging the decision of the high court which ordered the release of the passport. The counsel said the submissions made by Ifedayo Adedipe, Odili’s lead counsel, in previous courts sessions were misleading, thereby causing him and his client a lot of embarrassment. He prayed the court to revoke the order imposed against him and his client. Responding, Ifedayo told the court that his client has confirmed the release of the passport. In his ruling. Ekwo held that in view of the information from the NIS counsel and confirmation by Odili’s lawyer, the order of the court has been obeyed. “All orders made on December 21, 2021, and 21 January 2022 is hereby vacated,” he said. The court adjourned to May 25 for a report on the court of appeal proceedings.
