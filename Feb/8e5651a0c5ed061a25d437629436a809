Mohamed Salah and Sadio Mane both scored twice as Liverpool pummeled Leeds United 6-0 in their English Premier League (EPL) encounter at Anfield on Wednesday night. Salah scored two penalties while Mane netted a quick double in the last ten minutes to lead Liverpool to its biggest win of the season. Joel Matip and Virgil van Dijk were also on the scoresheet. Salah opened the floodgates with a well-dispatched penalty following a handball. The Egyptian striker repeated the trick on 35 minutes when Mane was brought down in the penalty area to make it 3-0 at the break. Liverpool then ran riot in the closing stages with Mane capitalising on a fatigued defence to score twice before van Dijk joined the party with a towering header from a corner kick. The win for Jurgen Klopp’s side cuts Manchester City’s lead at the top of the EPL table to three points. Liverpool also has a better goals difference (50 goals) than Pep Guardiola’s City (46 goals) with 12 matches left to go in the title race. In the other game of the night, Tottenham suffered a blow to their top-four aspirations following a 1-0 loss at Burnley who also increased their chance of survival at the bottom of the league.
