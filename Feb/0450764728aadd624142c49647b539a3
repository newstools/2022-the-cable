Luciano Spalletti, head coach of Napoli, has emphasised the need for his players to improve their service to Victor Osimhen. The 23-year-old Nigeria international marked his return for the Seria A side since November with a goal in Sunday’s 2-0 win at Venezia. The Super Eagles forward opened the scoring in the 59th minute after which Andrea Petagna sealed the victory with a goal in stoppage time. In a chat with DAZN after the game, Spalletti said Osimhen has to quality to score plenty of goals but needs the services of his teammates. “He (Osimhen) has the quality, it’s us who have to improve in serving him, not dribbling all the time and not putting the defenders in a position to defend against his qualities,” he said, according to Football Italia. “In the first half, we played too much man to man and not enough in space, forcing him to have the entire opposing team around him. “This win gives us that superior awareness, we have the possibility to play good games, to always play to win. Today we brought home an important win on a difficult pitch.” Osimhen has scored six goals in 14 matches for Napoli in Seria A this season. Napoli’s next match will be against league leaders Inter Milan who have a game in hand with just a point separating both teams.
