Seyi Makinde, the Oyo governor, has approved March 11 for the installation of the new Olubadan of Ibadan. The approval was contained in a letter addressed to Lekan Balogun, the Olubadan designate, and signed by Bashir Olanrewaju, permanent secretary, ministry of local government and chieftaincy matters in Oyo. The governor also congratulated Balogun on his elevation as Olubadan. “I refer to a letter dated No.IBSELG243TI/17 of February 16, 2022, on the above subject and inform you that His Excellency, the Executive Governor of Oyo State, has approved March 11, 2022 as the date of the installation of the new Olubadan of Ibadan,” the letter reads. “Once again, Congratulations Kabiyesi.” The governor had, on February 14, approved Balogun as the 42nd Olubadan of Ibadanland. The governor’s approval came after the Olubadan-in-Council recommended Balogun as the next king. Balogun will succeed Saliu Adetunji, who died on January 2, 2022, at the age of 93. Adetunji spent six years on the throne before his death.
