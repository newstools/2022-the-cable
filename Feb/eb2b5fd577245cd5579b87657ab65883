Arla Foods, makers of Dano Milk, has signed an agreement with its joint-venture partner, Tolaram Group, to build a Danish-designed state-of-the-art commercial dairy farm in Kaduna State, as part of efforts aimed at boosting local milk production. Construction of the dairy farm, which has since started, is expected to be completed by the end of the year. Located in Kaduna State, the 200-hectare farm will house 400 imported dairy cows, modern milking parlor, advanced animal cooling technology and all other modern technology used in dairy farms today. Furthermore, the farm will produce all roughage for feeding and would have housing facilities for its employees. The milk will be processed by Arla’s dairy plant in Kaduna to supply locally produced dairy products to Nigerian consumers. <img class="alignnone wp-image-659429" src="https://f5p3e9e4.stackpathcdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/2021-11-04-Overview-3D-from-security-house-2.png" alt="" width="550" height="310" srcset="https://f5p3e9e4.stackpathcdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/2021-11-04-Overview-3D-from-security-house-2.png 1914w, https://f5p3e9e4.stackpathcdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/2021-11-04-Overview-3D-from-security-house-2-300x169.png 300w, https://f5p3e9e4.stackpathcdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/2021-11-04-Overview-3D-from-security-house-2-1024x577.png 1024w, https://f5p3e9e4.stackpathcdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/2021-11-04-Overview-3D-from-security-house-2-768x433.png 768w, https://f5p3e9e4.stackpathcdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/2021-11-04-Overview-3D-from-security-house-2-1536x865.png 1536w, https://f5p3e9e4.stackpathcdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/2021-11-04-Overview-3D-from-security-house-2-24x14.png 24w, https://f5p3e9e4.stackpathcdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/2021-11-04-Overview-3D-from-security-house-2-36x20.png 36w, https://f5p3e9e4.stackpathcdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/2021-11-04-Overview-3D-from-security-house-2-48x27.png 48w" sizes="(max-width: 550px) 100vw, 550px" /> Arla Foods farm management expert, Snorri Sigurdsson, says, “We are highly delighted by the signing of the construction agreement with our joint-venture partners, Tolaram Group.
