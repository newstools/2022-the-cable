The Oyo state government and the Ibadan Electricity Distribution Company (IBEDC) say they have resolved their disagreement. On Wednesday, the state government sealed off IBEDC offices over alleged failure to pay mandatory bills and taxes. The action was taken after IBEDC reportedly disconnected the electricity supply to the state secretariat. John Ayodele, chief operating officer of IBEDC, had said the government was owing IBEDC N450 million for electricity used over a period of three years. But Wasiu Olatunbosun, the Oyo commissioner for information, said the government’s action was not taken as retaliation for the disconnection of electricity to the state secretariat. Olatunbosun said IBEDC also owes N139,440,000 in harmonised bills, N122,590,000 infrastructure bills, N116,516,111.41 tax audit bills and N22,000,000 signage bills. However, following a meeting held at the government secretariat, Agodi, Ibadan, on Thursday, the two parties declared a truce and expressed their readiness to work together to find “an amicable resolution” to all contentious issues. In a statement jointly signed by Temilolu Ashamu, commissioner for energy and mineral resources, and John Ayodele, chief operating officer of IBEDC, the parties assured residents that they will continue to work together in public interest. They also assured members of the public that electricity will be restored and metres made available to residents. “This is to notify the general public that the Oyo State Government and the IBEDC have resolved and agreed to work together in the interest of the public,” the statement reads. “The general public is hereby assured of the restoration of electricity supply as soon as possible, while the two parties shall continue amicable resolution of the issue in the interest of the public, including working together to make electricity meters available to residents of the state.”
