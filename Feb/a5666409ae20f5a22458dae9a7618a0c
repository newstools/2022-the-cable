The Osun police command says one person was shot dead by gunmen on Saturday at a polling centre in Odogbo-Ijesa, Atakumosa East LGA of the state. The deceased was said to have been pulled aside while on the queue to vote during the All Progressives Congress (APC) governorship primary election in his ward. According to NAN, Yemisi Opalola, the state police command spokesperson, said the killing is cult-related. Opalola was quoted as saying the killers and the victim were suspected members of cult groups. “It was reported that a gang of six men, led by a known and wanted cultist (name withheld), went to a polling centre in Odogbo-Ijesa in Atakumosa East and pulled out their victim out from the queue,” she said. “The suspects were reported to have shot their victim dead before driving off in a Hilux truck and motorcycle they came with. “The witnesses at the scene and some residents claimed that the victim was also a known cultist in the community. “When the police were informed of the incident, they chased the suspects and accosted them at Iwara-Ijesa. “The suspects then opened gunfire at the police team, which led to an exchange of gunshots that eventually forced the suspects to flee into the bushes, after they were overpowered, thereby leaving their vehicle and motorcycle behind.” Opalola added that the police was on the trail of the suspects.
