D’Tigress, the national women’s basketball team, will receive a cash reward of N25 million from the federal government for winning the 2020 Afrobasketball championships in Cameroon. D’Tigress beat Mali in the championship’s final in Cameroon last year to win the Afrobasketball women’s title for the third time in a row. Sunday Dare, the minister of youth and sports development, had recommended that a token of appreciation be given to the basketballers for doing the nation proud. The request has now received President Muhammadu Buhari’s approval. Apart from their dominance on the continent, D’Tigress have also become a global force. Last week, they qualified as Africa’s sole representatives to the FIBA women’s World Cup holding in Sydney, Australia in September. After losing their first game to China, the Nigerians beat France, the world number five team, and Mali, their bitter African rivals, to seal their place in the World Cup finals.
