There has been a fire outbreak at the ministry of finance building in the federal capital territory (FCT). Black smoke was seen billowing from a part of the building which is located at the Central Business District of Abuja on Wednesday. It is not yet certain what led to the fire. But TheCable learnt the fire was put out and that it did not affect a major part of the building. The fire outbreak is just the latest of many that have affected government offices in Abuja. In May 2020, fire burnt a part of the Nigerian Postal Service (NIPOST) building in the FCT. A month before that incident, a building housing the office of the accountant-general of the federation (AGF) was gutted by fire. In 2018, the Federal Fire Service (FFS) said Nigeria lost about N5 trillion to fire incidents in four years.
