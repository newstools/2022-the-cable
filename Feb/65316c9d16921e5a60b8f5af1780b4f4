The south-south team continued its dominance on Thursday at the PwC Under 17 Cricket Championship with victories against south-west and north-west in male and female categories respectively with a total of four games played on matchday 2. The first female game ended earlier than expected as south-south, the defending champions, needed only 4.3 overs to see off the north-west zone. South-south, which won the toss and opted to bat, scored 143 runs for the loss of six wickets in 20 overs. It had Peculiar Agboya to thank for her individual score of 53 runs in 51 balls, including six boundary hits, while Divine Uranta contributed 21 runs after facing 31 balls. The second innings meant north-west had to chase 144 runs but was still overpowered by the experienced south-south team. Agboya did the damage again as she was responsible for the fall of three wickets as well as Rejoice Assan, with three wickets against their opponents who managed eight runs, all wickets out in the fourth over. Elsewhere, north-central defeated south-west by 13 runs in the second female event. The south-west won the toss and elected to field, with north-central scoring 58 runs for nine in 20 overs while the south-west scored 45 runs all out in 8.4 overs. The final game in the male category saw north-central lose by six runs to north-west. North-west won the toss and opted to bat, scoring 111 runs all out in 19.4 overs while north-central scored 105 runs all out in 23.3 overs. Friday matches will see south-east meet south-west while north-east meet north-central in the male event. In the female category, north-east will meet north-west while south-east faces south-west. The soaring south-south team, having played two matches so far, will observe a rest day.
