The federal government, on Friday, held separate meetings with the ambassadors of Ukraine and Russia to discuss the safety of Nigerians in Ukraine. Valerii Kirdoda, Ukrainian ambassador to Nigeria, and Alexei Shebarshin, Russian ambassador to Nigeria, met with Geoffrey Onyeama, minister of foreign affairs, in Abuja. The federal government had earlier expressed concern over the safety of Nigerians in Ukraine following the invasion of the country by Russia. As of Saturday, over 150 persons had been reported killed, while more than 1,000 individuals had sustained injuries. Speaking to journalists after the meeting, Kirdoda said the Ukraine government would work with Nigeria to ensure the safe evacuation of Nigerians once it is safe to conduct flights. “Currently, the relocation of Nigerian students back to Nigeria isn’t possible, because it isn’t safe to fly in Ukraine skies,” he said through an interpreter. “But as soon as it becomes possible and safe to fly in Ukraine skies, we will work with the Nigerian embassy in Ukraine and the Nigerian government to arrange for the relocation of Nigerian students.” Onyeama also held a meeting with envoys of the G7 countries in Nigeria on Friday. Speaking after the meeting, the minister said the Nigerian government supports the position of withdrawing Russian troops from Ukraine.
