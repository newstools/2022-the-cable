Governors of the All Progressives Congress (APC) say they are on the same page on issues bordering on the national convention and zoning arrangement. After meeting with President Muhammadu Buhari on Tuesday, Atiku Bagudu, chairman of the APC governors’ forum, said they are in support of the new date for the party’s national convention. The party had on Monday fixed its convention for March 26 while March 12 was earmarked for zonal congresses. The APC had earlier fixed February 26 for the convention but a postponement was announced by John Akpanudoedehe, national secretary of the caretaker committee. Speaking on behalf of his colleagues, Nasir El-Rufai, governor of Kaduna state, said while they may have differences, the governors are not divided. He said: “There were differences among governors over the timing of the convention. This is what the media called ‘divided governors’. There’s no way you can have 22 governors agreeing on every issue. You can have differences, but to call it division is using a word too far. “But after our meeting last night to deliberate on the proposal by the national caretaker committee, and our briefing with Mr President today, we are all on the same page. “We have agreed on a zoning formula for all the six geopolitical zones. Essentially, we swapped northern zones to take positions that southern zones had in the last eight years and vice versa. “It’s a very simple, equitable and fair zoning formula for all geopolitical zones. We will now go back and consult at the zonal level and look at the positions that are available and the process of the convention preparation will start in earnest. “So by the grace of God,  by March 26, we will have done the APC national convention. El-Rufai added that the progressive governors are “united in our resolve to ensure that the Peoples Destruction Party doesn’t come back to power”.
