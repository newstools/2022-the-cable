President Muhammadu Buhari has asked the senate to confirm nominees for the Nigeria Electricity Regulation Commission (NERC), Nigerian Midstream and Downstream Petroleum Regulatory Authority and the Nigerian Deposit Insurance Corporation (NDIC). Buhari’s request for the confirmation of the nominees was in three letters read by Senate President Ahmad Lawan on the floor of the upper legislative chamber on Wednesday. In the letters, the president cited the relevant laws which empower him to make the appointments. The commissioners appointed for NERC are; Yusuf Ali (north-central), Chidi Ike (south-east), Nathan Shetty (north-east), and Dafe Apeneye (south-south). For the midstream and downstream authority, Buhari asked the upper legislative chamber to confirm Francis Alabo Ogali, Mustapha Lawade, Monsuru Kulia, Bashiru Sadiq and Zainab Gobir as executive directors. Emili Chidinma Osuji was appointed as the executive director of the NDIC. The nominees will be screened by the relevant committees of the senate before they are confirmed. The nominations will be referred to the relevant committees of the upper legislative chamber on the next legislative day.
