Malla Sasime, vice-chairman, Bayelsa traditional rulers council, says Vice-President Yemi Osinbajo will make a good presidential candidate for the 2023 election. He made the comment on Saturday when Osinbajo visited the state to perform the groundbreaking of the construction of the Angiama-Oporoma Bridge. Sasime said Osinbajo’s name has been on the lips of Nigerians for good reasons because people appreciate his efforts in governance. “Vice President, your name has been called for very good reasons; and the reason why your name has been on is maybe people think that you have been very good and we appreciate your efforts in governance,” he said. “If you come out for president, you will be a good material as those rumours are all over the place in the social media. “So, we thank you for being a good vice president; we hope that you keep your relationship with Bayelsa in very good stead; thank you very much.” Osinbajo thanked Sasime for the reception, saying he was in the state to identify with the developmental projects of the governor in collaboration with the federal government. “We will be driving in a few minutes on the Yenagoa-Oporoma-Ukubie road; and thereafter, we will be performing the groundbreaking of the Angiama-Oporoma Bridge–which are very crucial projects,” he said. “I am sure you all know how important that road project is; and how several governments have worked on it including the immediate past governor of the state. “They have done their own bit up to a point and in the true tradition of continuum of the government, the current governor is set to complete the project and to ensure that he made available to the good people of Bayelsa, especially many of these communities that will benefit significantly from this.”
