Femi Falana, human rights lawyer, has asked that the suspects in the murder of Timothy Adegoke, a post-graduate student of Obafemi Awolowo University (OAU), be transferred to Osun state for prosecution. Falana, in a letter addressed to Usman Baba, inspector-general of police, said the suspects should have been charged to court in the jurisdiction where the incident happened — Osun — and not Abuja. On November 5, 2021, Adegoke, a 37-year-old man travelled from Abuja to take an examination at OAU distance learning centre in Moro, Osun. He was said to have lodged at Hilton Hotel and Resorts, Ile Ife. He was, however, declared missing two days later — only to be found dead. Subsequently, the police arrested and charged Ramon Adedoyin, chairman of the hotel, and six suspects to an Abuja high court for alleged involvement in the murder of Adegoke. Addressing the IGP, Falana said he should ensure that the case file is handed over to the attorney-general of Osun state for prosecution. “Based on the complaint of our clients the Nigeria Police Force arrested some of the suspects while others who are currently at large had been declared wanted,” the letter reads. “To our utter dismay the arrested suspects have been arraigned before the High Court of the Federal Capital Territory on a 7- count charge of conspiracy to commit murder, murder, conspiracy to commit improper or indecent interference with the body of the deceased, uttering and intent to destroy evidence under the Penal Code. “However, as all the aforesaid criminal offences were said to have been committed at Ile-Ife you will agree with us that the suspects ought to have been charged before a court of competent jurisdiction in Osun state.” The family of the deceased, in a letter dated February 3, had sought the legal services of Falana to demand justice.
