Akinwumi Adesina, president of the African Development Bank (AfDB), has extolled the virtues of President John Magufuli of Tanzania, who died in office in March 2021. According to a statement issued by AfDB on Saturday, Adesina spoke during a three-day official visit to Tanzania. The AfDB boss, on Thursday, travelled to Chato, Tanzania, to pay homage to the late president, who he described as “a dear friend, brother and partner”. Laying a wreath at Magufuli’s grave, Adesina reminisced about how they shared a common love and passion for the accelerated development of Africa. Adesina also commended the late president for transforming Tanzania within a short time. “I miss our engaging discussions about Africa. I miss our discussions on your vision for Tanzania. In a very short time, you transformed Tanzania,” Adesina wrote in the condolence book. “You were bold. You were determined. I thank God for your life. I thank God for your outstanding service to Tanzania; for all you did to improve the lives of your people, who you loved very dearly.” Following his visit to Chato, Adesina met with Janet Magufuli, the president’s widow. He assured her that the AfDB would continue supporting the late president’s projects to fulfill his desires for a prosperous Tanzania, particularly in the development of modern infrastructure. Adesina had earlier joined Tanzanian President Samia Hassan at a ceremony to launch the construction of a 112.3-kilometre ring road in the capital city of Dodoma. There, he recalled how Magufuli had expressed interest in having the road built to decongest the city. “I told him the African Development Bank would strongly support Tanzania. I told him he should consider it done,” Adesina said.
