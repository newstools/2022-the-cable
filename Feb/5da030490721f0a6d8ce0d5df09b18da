Adamu Aliero, senator representing Kebbi central, has described the spike in cases of kidnapping across the country as a “national disgrace”. Aliero spoke on Wednesday while contributing to a debate on a motion sponsored by Bello Mandiya, senator representing Katsina south. Mandiya had drawn the attention of his colleagues to the kidnapping of over 30 people from Faskari LGA of Katsina. In response, the Kebbi senator said urgent measures need to be put in place to address the issue of kidnapping in the country. “It is indeed a national disgrace that this thing is happening on a daily basis. Something needs to be done urgently and our security forces have to be encouraged, supported,” he said. “If it is the issue of lack of manpower, we can get more policemen to ensure that every part of this country has enough security agents to take care of this menace. “If it is an issue of recruitment in the army, we should also do the same.” On his part, Senate President Ahmad Lawan wondered why the military is not able to stem the tide of kidnapping despite the provision of more funds. “The military is getting better funding from the government and what we intend to see is better output,” Lawan said. “The military needs to wake up, we want to see a difference because we have made a difference in terms of funding.”
