The post has attracted 671 likes, 197 comments and 538 shares. A further look at the report attributed to the former president showed there was no mention of the date or venue where he purportedly made the statement. Also, no other credible news medium in the country reported the statement aside Daily Times. However,  in a keynote address he delivered in 2016, Obasanjo described “Biafra secession issue” as dead, and advised that no Nigerian should give vent to the agitation. When contacted by TheCable, Kehinde Akinyemi, Obasanjo’s spokesman, dismissed the claim, saying the former president would not utter such statement. He described the post as a way to garner “unconscionable followership and accrue funds by the news media,” he said. “It’s fake. Baba won’t even comment on such issue.” VERDICT There is no proof Obasanjo said Nnamdi Kanu will get Biafra.
