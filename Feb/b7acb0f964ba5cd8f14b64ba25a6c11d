Abubakar Aliyu, minister of power, says the federal government is willing to partner with investors in the power sector to improve the power supply in the country. Aliyu said this while receiving Hidayet Bayratar, the ambassador of Turkey to Nigeria, and two other delegates in Abuja. According to NAN, Mathew Osumanyi Dan’asabe, information officer, press and public relations, ministry of power, released a statement to this effect. He said President Muhammadu Buhari’s aspiration is to ensure that the power industry is owned by the government and the private sector. According to him, the ties between Nigeria and Turkey is a long-standing one which led to the signing of a memorandum of understanding (MoU) between Turkey and Nigeria in October 2021. Aliyu described the distribution aspect of the power sector in the country as an area worth investing in. The minister urged Turkey and the rest of the world to partner with Nigeria and share experience in energy, renewable energy and energy efficiency. In his response, the envoy noted that their visit was a follow-up to the MoU signed in 2021. Both countries had in 2021 signed some major agreements and memorandum of understandings (MoUs) in key sectors, including Energy, Defense Industry, Mining and Hydrocarbons.
