Bola Tinubu, chieftain of the All Progressives Congress (APC), has returned to Nigeria after a week of “consultations” in the United Kingdom (UK). The former Lagos governor arrived the Murtala Muhammed International Airport in Lagos on Sunday. TheCable had reported how Tinubu jetted out of the country in January after weeks of consultations across the country over his 2023 presidential ambition. He was rumoured to have visited the European country to rest and undergo medical checkup, while a source in his camp said he went to visit his family in the UK. Tunde Rahman, Tinubu’s media aide, later said his principal went to the UK for “meetings and consultations”. While in London, he had meetings with the UK chapter of the APC. In January, Tinubu visited President Muhammadu Buhari during which he announced his intention to contest the presidency in 2023. <img class="alignnone wp-image-659316 size-large" src="https://f5p3e9e4.stackpathcdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/IMG-20220206-WA0003-1024x683.jpg" alt="" width="900" height="600" srcset="https://f5p3e9e4.stackpathcdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/IMG-20220206-WA0003-1024x683.jpg 1024w, https://f5p3e9e4.stackpathcdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/IMG-20220206-WA0003-300x200.jpg 300w, https://f5p3e9e4.stackpathcdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/IMG-20220206-WA0003-768x512.jpg 768w, https://f5p3e9e4.stackpathcdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/IMG-20220206-WA0003-24x16.jpg 24w, https://f5p3e9e4.stackpathcdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/IMG-20220206-WA0003-36x24.jpg 36w, https://f5p3e9e4.stackpathcdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/IMG-20220206-WA0003-48x32.jpg 48w, https://f5p3e9e4.stackpathcdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/IMG-20220206-WA0003.jpg 1080w" sizes="(max-width: 900px) 100vw, 900px" /> <img class="alignnone wp-image-659315 size-full" src="https://f5p3e9e4.stackpathcdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/IMG-20220206-WA0004.jpg" alt="" width="964" height="723" srcset="https://f5p3e9e4.stackpathcdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/IMG-20220206-WA0004.jpg 964w, https://f5p3e9e4.stackpathcdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/IMG-20220206-WA0004-300x225.jpg 300w, https://f5p3e9e4.stackpathcdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/IMG-20220206-WA0004-768x576.jpg 768w, https://f5p3e9e4.stackpathcdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/IMG-20220206-WA0004-24x18.jpg 24w, https://f5p3e9e4.stackpathcdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/IMG-20220206-WA0004-36x27.jpg 36w, https://f5p3e9e4.stackpathcdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/IMG-20220206-WA0004-48x36.jpg 48w" sizes="(max-width: 964px) 100vw, 964px" /> <img class="alignnone wp-image-659314 size-large" src="https://f5p3e9e4.stackpathcdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/IMG-20220206-WA0005-1-1024x1010.jpg" alt="" width="900" height="888" srcset="https://f5p3e9e4.stackpathcdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/IMG-20220206-WA0005-1-1024x1010.jpg 1024w, https://f5p3e9e4.stackpathcdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/IMG-20220206-WA0005-1-300x296.jpg 300w, https://f5p3e9e4.stackpathcdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/IMG-20220206-WA0005-1-768x757.jpg 768w, https://f5p3e9e4.stackpathcdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/IMG-20220206-WA0005-1-24x24.jpg 24w, https://f5p3e9e4.stackpathcdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/IMG-20220206-WA0005-1-36x36.jpg 36w, https://f5p3e9e4.stackpathcdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/IMG-20220206-WA0005-1-48x48.jpg 48w, https://f5p3e9e4.stackpathcdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/IMG-20220206-WA0005-1.jpg 1080w" sizes="(max-width: 900px) 100vw, 900px" />
