Sunday Dare, minister of youth sports, says Nigerians must take issues about climate change seriously to tackle food insecurity and imbalances in the planet’s ecosystem. The minister, who spoke at the 2022 Environment Symposium held in Abuja on Thursday, said Nigeria is not immune from the adverse effects of climate change. He said climate change, caused majorly by human activities, is unbalancing the weather of the earth; sustainability of its ecosystem; future of humankind, and the stability of the global economy. “Nigeria is not immune from the adverse effects of climate change. We are experiencing increases in temperature; variable rainfall; rise in sea level and flooding; drought and desertification; land degradation; more frequent extreme weather events which are affecting fresh water resources and leading to loss of biodiversity,” he said. “Economic activities such as agriculture, fishery, and forestry are also taking big hits in different locations in the country.” The minister, who was represented by Ann Kemi Areola, his aide on youth and ICT, said the federal government has introduced several initiatives including the “Green Stimulus Programme” to advance knowledge in renewable energy and smart agriculture. According to him, the efforts are aimed at stepping up awareness that would enable Nigerian youths to make informed decisions on food choices in line with global practices. “Recent global priorities have centered on fighting the impacts of climate change, unemployment, poverty, gender inequality, conflict, and migration, challenging the youth to mobilise themselves, join forces around the world and hold decision makers accountable,” he added.
