The National Council on Privatisation (NCP) has approved 42 transactions to be executed by the Bureau of Public Enterprises (BPE) in 2022. The council is chaired by Vice-President Yemi Osinbajo. Ibeh Uzoma Chidi, head, public communications at BPE, said this in a statement on Friday. Chidi said the BPE’s work plan got the council’s nod at its first meeting for the year 2022, held at the Presidential Villa, Aso Rock Abuja, after its inauguration last week. On Tuesday, Osinbajo tasked members of the reconstituted NCP to tackle new transactions and reform activities of the federal government as well as resolve some of the thorny economic issues that are critical to the country’s accelerated economic development. Out of the 42 transactions, the statement added that 11 are in the energy sector, 10 are in the industries and services sector while eight transactions will be executed in the agriculture and natural services sector; 13 are in the infrastructure and public-private partnership (IPPP) sector. “NCP also approved the 2022 revenue and expenditure of the bureau, including the 2022 work plan risks and mitigation plans,” the statement reads. BPE, at the end of every year, carries out a post-mortem review of its activities and achievements via a vis the current year’s work plan. It then prepares a detailed work plan containing the deliverables and the cost and revenue estimates for the incoming year for consideration and approval by the NCP. According to the statement, the work plan provides the framework for tracking the implementation and realisation of the approved projects contained therein. “It is a compendium of the various projects and reform initiatives which the BPE intends to carry out in 2022,” it added.
