The Nigeria Football Federation (NFF) has revealed the date for the reverse FIFA World Cup Qatar 2022 play-off leg between the Super Eagles and Ghana. In a statement on Tuesday, the federation said the return leg of the play-off will be played at the renovated MKO Abiola Stadium, Abuja on March 27. The NFF also disclosed that the Ghana Football Association (GFA) is yet to confirm between “Wednesday, 23rd March or Thursday, 24th March” for the first leg of the encounter billed for the Cape Coast Stadium. “Nigeria and Ghana will face off in a pitched battle at the MKO Abiola National Stadium, Abuja on Sunday, 27th March in what is the final leg of a potentially –explosive FIFA World Cup Qatar 2022 play-off round,” the statement read. “The Nigeria Football Federation on Tuesday confirmed the date of the reverse leg to the Confederation of African Football, with the Ghana Football Association now to confirm whether the first leg inside the Cape Coast Stadium will be on Wednesday, 23rd March or Thursday, 24th March. “The final leg encounter will be the 59th clash at senior level between both West African giants in a chequered 71 –year rivalry, and will also be the first game involving the Super Eagles at the country’s premium sporting arena since the Eagles defeated Sudan’s Falcons of Jediane 3-1 in an Africa Cup of Nations qualifying match on 15th October 2014.” Super Eagles will be facing the Black Stars with a newly reconstituted technical crew headed by Austin Eguavoen, who has been retained as the team’s technical adviser. The Stars are, however, without a manager following the sacking of Milovan Rajevac over the team’s performance at the recently concluded African Cup of Nations (AFCON).
