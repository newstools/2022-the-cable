The Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) has asked for an independent commission of inquiry to probe the circumstances around the distribution of petrol with methanol quantity above Nigeria’s specification. The federal government had, on Wednesday, said it would investigate the supply of the off-spec petrol recently imported into the country. Speaking on the development in a statement issued on Thursday by Debo Ologunagba, PDP spokesperson, the party said it doesn’t trust the internal probe of the federal government. The opposition party also accused the All Progressives Congress (APC) of trying to cover up the circumstances into the incident. “The Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) alerts Nigerians of the attempt by the All Progressives Congress (APC) to provide official cover for APC leaders reportedly involved in the criminal importation of toxic fuel into our country,” the statement reads. “Against this backdrop, the PDP rejects the announced internal investigation of this terrible crime by the government as the APC administration cannot be trusted given its manifest predilection to shield the APC leaders involved. “Nigerians note the various investigations instituted by the APC government in the past which ended without any meaningful outcome; notable among which was the manipulated EndSARS Report. “The PDP therefore demands an Independent Commission of Enquiry to investigate all issues connected to the ‘APC Toxic Fuel ImportGate’. Those involved must be exposed and held accountable. “Where was the toxic fuel imported from? Which company is the pre-inspection agent? How much was paid for the very cheap contaminated fuel and through which banks were payment effected? All documents relating to the transaction must be made public.”
