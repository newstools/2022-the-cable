Akinwunmi Ambode, former governor of Lagos state, has asked Nigerian youths to register and get their permanent voter cards (PVCs) to vote in the 2023 elections. The former Lagos governor, in a statement shared on his verified social media platforms on Tuesday, said power is in the hands of the youth. He thanked his supporters for the “overwhelming endorsement” over his “modest contributions” to the growth of Lagos. “After all we have been through, God has been faithful. Thank you for the overwhelming endorsement of our modest contributions to the growth of Lagos,” he said. “It can only get better for Lagos, and indeed Nigeria. The youths are coming.
The power is in their hands. Go and get your Permanent Voters Card (PVC) ready. Your future is NOW!” https://www.instagram.com/p/CZbmKixLNfl/?utm_medium=copy_link Although Ambode has not announced his intention to contest any political office in 2023, the former governor is still qualified to contest for a couple of positions, including the number one seat in Lagos. On January 16, the former Lagos governor inaugurated the turf wicket of Tafawa Balewa Square (TBS) Cricket Oval in the state. In February 2021, Ambode revalidated his membership of the All Progressives Congress (APC) at Epe ward — his first public appearance since the 2019 elections. In May, 2021, he was appointed as the deputy chairman of the south-west subcommittee of the contact and strategy committee of the APC.
