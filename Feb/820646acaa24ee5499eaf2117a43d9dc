The Economic and Financial Crimes Commission (EFCC) says it has released Osita Okechukwu, director-general, Voice of Nigeria (VON), who was detained over fraud allegations. Okechukwu arrived at the EFCC headquarters in Abuja on January 29 around 1:30 pm following an invitation regarding a case bordering on alleged conspiracy, abuse of office, and misappropriation of public funds. He was reportedly questioned for allegedly embezzling N1.3 billion. On Saturday, Wilson Uwujaren, EFCC spokesperson, told TheCable that Okechukwu has been released. “He was released on Monday,” Uwujaren said, adding that investigations continue. The VON DG has been relatively outspoken about national issues in recent months. He contributed to the discourse on the electoral bill and recently asked the federal government to release Nnamdi Kanu, leader of the proscribed Indigenous People of Biafra (IPOB) who is currently in the custody of the Department of State Services (DSS).
