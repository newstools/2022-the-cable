Some members of the All Progressives Congress (APC) in Osun state have alleged removal of their names from the party’s register in the ongoing governorship primary of the party. The aggrieved APC members, who are loyal to Moshood Adeoti, an aspirant, expressed displeasure at ward 15, Oyan, Odo-Otin LGA of the state, on Saturday. The Osun APC has been divided into two major factions — a development that has created disharmony in the party. A faction of the party known as the Ileri Oluwa group is loyal to Gboyega Oyetola, the incumbent governor of Osun, who is also contesting for a second term ticket. The other faction — TOP — is loyal to Rauf Aregbesola, minister of interior and a former governor of the state, supporting Adeoti, a former secretary to the state government. The party members claimed that despite having the party’s membership cards, their names were missing on the register at the wards for the primary election. Reacting to the development, Adesola Adegbite, a party member, said the move disenfranchised them. “This morning, our people gathered here at CMS ground in Oyan town. We were very excited and waiting to cast our votes. After some minutes, we observed that they (referring to voting officials) brought out some papers, and they pasted them on the walls,” she said. “We were told that the papers contain names of APC registered members. When we went to check the list, we did not see our names. Our names have been removed, despite that, we are with our membership cards. This is why we are protesting that the primary should be free and fair.” Another APC member who identified herself as Afolabi Adenike alleged that party members loyal to The Osun Progressives (TOP) faction did not find their names on the membership list.
