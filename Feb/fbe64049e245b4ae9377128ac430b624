Emirates Airline, the flag carrier of the United Arab Emirates (UAE), says it will resume passenger flight operations between Dubai and Nigeria on Saturday, February 5, 2022. The development comes a day after the federal government approved the resumption of flights between the two countries. In a statement on Wednesday, the airline said travellers coming from Nigeria must hold a negative COVID-19 polymerase chain reaction (PCR) certificate for a test taken no more than 48 hours before departure. With this, TheCable understands that passengers from Nigeria will need to take the COVID-19 PCR test within two days before departure. Before now, the airline had requested a negative COVID-19 PCR certificate for a test taken no more than 72 hours before departure. It said that the test certificate must be obtained from an approved facility and also contain a QR code, adding that its validity would be calculated from the time the sample was collected. Upon arrival in Dubai, passengers will also undergo an additional COVID-19 PCR test and remain in self-quarantine until the results of the test are received. ‘Emirates will restart flights from Dubai to Nigeria from February 5, 2022.  The airline will operate to and from Abuja and Lagos with daily flights, providing more choice, comfort and enhanced connectivity for travellers connecting to Dubai and over 120 destinations,” the statement reads. “Emirates will operate to Abuja with EK 785 and 786.
