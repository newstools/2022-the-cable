The All Progressives Congress (APC) has notified the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) of its zonal congresses billed for March 26. In a letter addressed to Mahmood Yakubu, INEC chairman, Mai Mala Buni, national chairman of the APC caretaker committee, and John Akpanudoedehe, the national secretary, said the notice for the zonal congresses “supersedes” the letter notifying the commission of the party’s convention. The ruling party has not officially communicated any development about the convention billed for February 26. Insiders have told TheCable that with congresses now on the front burner, the convention may not take place as scheduled. Zonal officers, referred to as vice-chairpersons, will be elected during the congresses. In the letter dated February 21, Buni and Akpanudoedehe said the notice is in line with section 85 of the electoral act and section 12:6 of the APC constitution. “This notice supersedes our earlier notice for the National Convention referenced APC/NHDQ/INEC/019/22/14 this is predicated on the evaluation of our Party Constitution,” the notice reads. “In furtherance to Article 85 of the Electoral Act, 2010 (as amended) and compliance with Section 12:6 of our Party Constitution we hereby write to notify the Commission that our great Party, the All Progressives Congress (APC) has scheduled to hold its Zonal Congresses on Saturday 26th March, 2022. “Kindly arrange for your officials to monitor the exercise accordingly. While hoping to receive your cooperation, please accept the assurances of our highest esteem.”
