BudgIT, a civic tech non-profit organisation, and Connected Development (CODE), a civil society organisation, have entered into a partnership to track COVID intervention funds in 10 African countries. This is the second phase of the COVID-19 Transparency and Accountability Project (CTAP). In the first phase, BudgIT and CODE used their respective platforms — ‘Tracka’ and ‘Follow The Money (FTM)’ — to address “deeply rooted systemic profiteering culture” associated with ineffective feedback mechanisms for tracking COVID fund disbursements. A statement issued on Wednesday quoted Oluseun Onigbinde, BudgIT’s global director, as saying the partnership seeks to identify issues that have to do with procurement plans and vaccine distribution. “We will not only collaborate with governments in focus countries to institute proper and sustainable accountability systems, we will also enhance the COVID-19 Accountability Platform (covidfund.africa) with a digital dashboard that tracks health sector resourcing and accountability approaches,” Onigbinde said. On his part, Hamzat Lawal, founder of CODE, said both organisations will mobilise at least 1.7 million Africans digitally and offline to monitor emergency funds and demand health sector accountability. “We will also facilitate dialogue sessions between 36 CSOs and the government to create opportunities for engagement between both parties on improved funding and health sector accountability,” Lawal said. “The COVID-19 transparency and accountability project has been instrumental in strengthening COVID-19 fund accountability frameworks and devising strategies that enhance citizen-led advocacy for reforms. “We believe that this second phase will leverage existing partnerships with relevant stakeholders, the OGP and Global Health Organisations working on fiscal issues related to COVID-19 fund management and health sector accountability.”
