The All Progressives Congress (APC) has set up committees that will oversee its zonal congresses scheduled for March 12. In a statement on Thursday, John Akpanudoedehe, national secretary of the APC caretaker committee, said meetings of stakeholders will be held in the various geo-political zones. ”The APC has appointed committees for the Saturday 12th March, 2022 zonal congresses,” Akpanudoedehe said. “The chairmen of the committees are all members of the CECPC, while secretaries are selected from amongst the deputy governors from their respective geo-political zones. “Meetings of zonal stakeholders will be held on Saturday, 26 February, 2022 at the respective geo-political zones.” While Ken Nnamani, former senate president, will head the party’s committee in the south-east, David Lyon, sacked governor of Bayelsa, will chair that of the south-south.
