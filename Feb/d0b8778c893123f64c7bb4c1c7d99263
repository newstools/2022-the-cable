Dana Airlines Limited says its flight inbound Lagos from Abuja made an air return to Abuja due to bad weather. Kingsley Ezenwa, the airline’s spokesman, said this in a statement on Wednesday. Ezenwa said the passengers on board were later transferred to another aircraft. Airlines operating in Nigeria have recently made headlines over flight delays and cancellations. While bad weather condition has been highlighted as one of the major challenges, stakeholders have said that the rising cost of jet fuel and lack of parking spaces at the airports caused delays and cancellations of flights. The situation has also forced operators to increase airfares. “Our flight 9J 336 from Abuja to Lagos on 23rd February 2022 had an air return due to bad weather at the destination,” he said. The statement added that passengers on board were transferred to another aircraft operated by the company. “The passengers on the aircraft were advised to disembark and board another of our aircraft on the ground, so the aircraft that had the air return could refuel for another flight,” he said. “At Dana Air, the safety of our crew and passengers will remain at the centre of everything we do, and this commitment won’t change anytime soon.”
