Nigeria’s democracy and the role of civil society organisations (CSOs) will be the focus of the discussions at the upcoming edition of #ThursdayTalks, a monthly conversation on national issues. The virtual conference, powered by BudgIT and EIE Nigeria, is billed to hold via Zoom on February 24 by 5:30pm. ‘CSOs and The Future of Democratic Governance in Nigeria’ is the theme for this month’s session. Speakers and panellists for the event include Ene Obi, country director, ActionAid Nigeria; Udo Jude Ilo, Nigerian representative, Open Society Initiative for West Africa (OSIWA); and Abiola Akiyode-Afolabi, executive director, Women Advocates Research and Documentation Center (WARDC). “This month’s edition will spotlight Nigeria’s democratic journey, analyse key issues on elections, and probe the role of CSOs in promoting and sustaining Nigeria’s democracy,” a statement by EIE Nigeria reads. “This has become necessary following the frequent coup d’états across the West African sub-region in recent months, alongside the nation’s continual inability after over 60 years of independence to evolve democracy to the level of its guiding tenets and sustainability.” To join the conversation, register here.
