Emmanuel Udom, Akwa Ibom governor, says his preferred successor will guarantee economic prosperity in the state. On Sunday, Udom was said to have presented Umo Eno, a cleric and current commissioner for lands and water resources in the state, before stakeholders of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) as his preferred successor. The governor’s decision was said to have caused disaffection among some members of the state executive council and the party. Speaking on Tuesday at an interactive session with key party members in Uyo, the state capital, Udom described Eno as an epitome of humility “who is blessed with the common touch”. The governor added that Eno’s compelling story of growing up in the police barracks and navigating his way through a dint of hard work and dedication to his present status will resonate with the people. “Not only will his can-do spirit inspire our youths. He is a man of peace that will ensure that the peace and security of life that we have enjoyed in the last six years will be maintained,” the governor said. “He is a successful entrepreneur who has employed our people, lifted thousands from poverty to prosperity. He will be coming to the office of governor with an economic blueprint that will further guarantee employment, development, and economic prosperity for our people.” On his part, Eno said he was humbled by the decision of stakeholders in the state to back him as the next governor, while he asked party members to embrace peace. The commissioner also assured party members that he is in the gubernatorial race to take the state and its people to greater heights. Eno noted that he has begun consultation with all levels of the party structure to ensure PDP presents a united and formidable force during and after the primaries.
