The Peoples Redemption Party (PRP) has dismissed reports by a group claiming the party will hold its national convention on Saturday. In a statement on Friday, Kabiru Gwangwazo, acting national publicity secretary of PRP, said a group claiming to be members of the party had announced a national convention in Abuja. Gwangwazo described the purported convention as fake, adding that those behind the announcements are not recognised in the party. “The national elections and political parties regulator, INEC as well as all relevant agencies of State, the Police and others have been officially informed and will surely deal decisively with those involved with this illegality,” he said. “It is only with formal recognition of a political party and its registered leadership as certified by INEC and the Law that permits any claimant to canvass membership, to operate bank accounts, to solicit subscriptions or sell party cards and sell candidate nomination forms for elections at all levels. And indeed more fundamentally for election into party offices. “Those alleged to be planning the illegal convention of the 19th February don’t have any of these basic prerequisites to support their claim. “The PRP has always been the hope of the teeming underprivileged Nigerian people. Since its registration was reclaimed and a National Delegates Conference (NDC) held in September 2018 in which Malam Falalu Bello, OFR, was elected under the leadership of the Party’s National Leader and BOT Chairman Late Alhaji Abdulkadir Balarabe Musa, the party has been working on establishing solid structures across the States.” Gwangwazo said the agenda for a constituted national convention will be unveiled by the party in a few weeks.
