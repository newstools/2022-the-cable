Hakeem Muri-Okunola, head of service of Lagos, says he does not have any plan to replace Babajide Sanwo-Olu as governor of the state. The top Lagos official was reacting to reports alleging that he is interested in the state’s governorship election in 2023. In a statement on Sunday, Muri-Okunola said he supports Sanwo-Olu and his administration’s plan to develop good policies and infrastructure in Lagos. The head of service said those behind the publications are working to “plant a seed of discord between Governor Babajide Sanwo-Olu and me”. “My attention has been drawn to several publications linking me with a fictitious race for Lagos State Governor and plots to stop Governor Babajide Sanwo-Olu’s second term bid,” Muri-Okunola said. “I hereby dissociate myself from all publications and innuendoes conveying such plots. I reiterate my support for Governor Babajide Sanwo-Olu and his administration’s THEMES Agenda – the six-pillar development plan that is the compass for his projects and policies. “Contrary to the statements being published by mischief makers, who are also trying to play the religion card, I am fully focused on carrying out my duties as head of service of the Lagos state government and taking the Public Service to greater heights.”
