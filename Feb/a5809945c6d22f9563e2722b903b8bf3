Justin Trudeau, prime minister of Canada, has condemned the ongoing anti-vaccine trucker protest in the country, saying it “has to stop”. The prime minister condemned the protest in a tweet on his verified Twitter account on Tuesday. The demonstration tagged “Freedom Convoy” began on January 9 over a new rule stipulating that all truckers must be vaccinated to cross the US-Canada border. However, the protests have spiralled into a broader challenge of the country’s COVID health restrictions. The protesters have since gathered in downtown Ottawa near Parliament Hill, and their demands have grown to include ending all such mandates nationwide and opposing Trudeau’s government. On Sunday, Jim Watson, mayor of Ottawa, announced a state of emergency in the capital, declaring the protests “out of control”. In reaction, Trudeau, in the tweet, confirmed the deployment of “hundreds of Royal Canadian Mounted Police (RCMP) officers” to help local law enforcement agencies “to further strengthen our response” to the protest. He then promised to provide “whatever resources are needed to get the situation under control”. “Canadians have the right to protest, to disagree with their government, and to make their voices heard. We’ll always protect that right. But let’s be clear: They don’t have the right to blockade our economy, or our democracy, or our fellow citizens’ daily lives. It has to stop,” the tweet reads. “So far, hundreds of RCMP officers have been mobilized to support the Ottawa Police Services. We’re also working with municipal partners to further strengthen our response, and we’ll continue to be there with whatever resources are needed to get the situation under control.”
