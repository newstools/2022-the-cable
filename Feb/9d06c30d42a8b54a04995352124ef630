The federal government has disowned a viral statement purportedly from the ministry of foreign affairs warning Nigerians from travelling to Russia’s neighbouring countries. The six Eastern European countries mentioned in the statement were Belarus, Poland, Slovakia, Hungary, Romania and Moldova. In the statement purportedly signed by one Esther Sunsuwa, spokesperson of the ministry, the federal government was quoted to have said the embassies of the countries had stopped the issuance of their visas as a result of “the war alert from world powers” concerning Russia and Ukraine. The statement has been shared on different social media platforms and instant messaging apps, particularly Whatsapp. “The ministry of foreign affairs hereby advised, that all intending Nigeria nationals wishing to travel to Belarus, Poland, Slovakia, Hungary, Romania, and Moldova should be on hold until the month ending May 2022 as their embassy and the consulate have stopped issuance of visa with immediate effect,” the statement reads. “Necessary to abide to the above is the war alert from the world power to its citizen to leave those countries within 48 hours. “The fact is due to the unhealthy war alert that the world powers have given which may likely break out unforeseen war without further notice. “Also, Nigerians proceeding/intending to enter the above neighbouring named countries, between Russia and Ukraine should avoid such unbearable risk.” The foreign affairs ministry, via his Twitter handle, dismissed the statement as fake. Due to the escalating tension between Russia and Ukraine, the federal government of Nigeria, earlier in the month, had asked its citizens living in Ukraine to be security conscious. Nigerians in Ukraine were also advised to carry requisite identification at all times — and avoid unnecessary travel within the country.
