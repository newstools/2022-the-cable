Sadiya Umar Farouq, minister of humanitarian affairs, says the ministry has developed a national flood emergency preparedness and response plan. The minister spoke on Thursday during a briefing with state house correspondents. She said the plan, which has been validated by stakeholders, will be forwarded to the federal executive council (FEC) for approval. She added that the plan was necessitated by the need to address flooding, which she described as a “devastating natural disaster”. “Floods are without doubt among the most devastating natural disasters that occur in most parts of the country each year,” she said. “It was therefore understandable when Mr. President directed the ministry to work with all relevant stakeholders to develop a ‘National Flood Emergency Preparedness and Response Plan (NFEPRP)’ for Nigeria. “The plan sets all conditions to mitigate the consequences of flood, prepare for its occurrence, respond to it when it happens, and recover from it after it happens. In essence, the plan compels all stakeholders to manage floods in Nigeria. “The need for an integrated flood risk management system that would leverage on technology and new innovations such as flood mapping, flood early warning systems, etc., cannot be overemphasised. “The plan is to provide strategic guidance in a systematic and sequential manner for managing floods anywhere in Nigeria in a coordinated way, as well as getting stakeholders’ commitment and participation in the governance of flood risk reduction at all levels. “This will therefore improve local capacities for the identification, mitigation, prevention, response, assessment and monitoring of flood risks. “The plan has been developed and validated by stakeholders and it will be going to FEC for approval in the next few weeks.”
