Adedibu Ojerinde, former registrar of the Joint Admission and Matriculation Board (JAMB), has told a federal high court in Abuja that he is exploring the option of a plea bargain with the Independent Corrupt Practices and Other Related Offences Commission (ICPC). The ICPC arraigned Ojerinde on July 6, 2021, in a suit marked: FHC/ABJ/CR/97/2021, on an 18-count charge bordering on misappropriation of funds to the tune of N900 million. The commission alleged that the former registrar committed multiple frauds while heading JAMB and the National Examination Council (NECO). Ojerinde pleaded not guilty to the allegations and was granted bail in the sum of N200 million. At the court session on Tuesday, Ojerinde through his counsel, Ibrahim Ishyaku, prayed the court for an adjournment to enable him to finalise the plea bargain with the ICPC. Ishyaku said the trial can commence if, after 24 hours, the matter is not resolved. “My Lord, our plea is that we be given 24 hours to explore the possibility of a plea bargain to resolve this matter and we ask that the trial be adjourned for the period to enable us come up with our terms of settlement,” he said. Ebenezer Sogunle, ICPC lawyer, did not object to the adjournment. He, however, insisted that the trial will proceed if the plea bargain fails. Obiora Egwuatu, the judge, fixed February 9 for a report on the plea bargain to be presented.
