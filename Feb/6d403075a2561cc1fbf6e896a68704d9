The Independent Corrupt Practices and Other Related Offences Commission (ICPC) has arraigned Amaechi Akawo, former secretary-general of the Athletic Federation of Nigeria (AFN), over his alleged involvement in a $150,000 fraud. According to a statement by Azuka Ogugwa, ICPC spokesperson, Akawo was arraigned on a 10-count charge bordering on money laundering and fraudulent diversion of public funds before Inyang Ekwo, a federal high court judge on Friday. The commission accused the former secretary-general of diverting money released by the International Association of Athletics Federation (IAAF) for the successful hosting of the CAA Grand Prix Competition in Delta State, popularly known as the 2017 Warri Relay Competition. The ICPC said Akawo committed the offence on multiple occasions in July and August 2017, when he fraudulently diverted funds from the federal ministry of youth and sports development for his personal use. “His actions violated Sections 1 (a) and 16 (1) (d) of the Money Laundering Prohibition Act, 2011 and are punishable under relevant sections of the same act,” the statement read. Akawo entered a not guilty plea when the charge was read to him. Emmanuel Aghedo, defendant’s counsel, moved an application praying the court to grant bail to his client on liberal terms. Although Mashkur Salisu, counsel to the ICPC, did not object to the bail application, he urged the court to grant the defendant stringent bail conditions in order to ensure that he makes himself available to stand trial. Ruling on the bail application, Ekwo admitted Akawo to bail in the sum of N15 million, with one surety in like sum. The judge ordered that the surety must have landed property within the federal capital territory (FCT), and that the accused must deposit his international passport with the court registry. The matter was then adjourned till May 16, 17 and 18 for hearing.
