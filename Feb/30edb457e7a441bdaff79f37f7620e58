Mediahangountng, a media supportive initiative set up by the MHNG network, has entered into a partnership with the United States Mission in Nigeria on effective coverage of the 2023 general election. At a media parley held in Lagos on Wednesday with the theme, ‘The Media and Stakeholders Synergy towards 2023 Elections’, the group said the initiative is to identify ways journalists and other concerned parties can work together during the elections. In a statement issued after the event, the group said the roundtable will look into issues of violence against journalists, as well as the commitment of the police to supporting effective reportage. The group also said the discussion would highlight the need for the federal government “to sensitise the public on the power of voting, voting process, zero violence during election, among others, before, during and after the election through effective media campaigns, and give the Nigerian media unlimited access to information”. The meeting also focused on “how corporate organisations can play a role in sensitising the public on the power to vote and how the international community can ensure elections are free and fair”. Among those present at the event were: Laolu Akande, spokesperson to the vice-president; Arukaino Mukoro; Gboyega Akosile, chief press secretary to Lagos governor; Simon Kolawole, chief executive officer (CEO) of Cable Newspaper Limited; Kolapo Olapoju, editor of TheCable; Dan Ikpoyi of BBC; Rufai Oseni and Ohi Odia of Arise News; and David Ajikobi of Africa Check.
