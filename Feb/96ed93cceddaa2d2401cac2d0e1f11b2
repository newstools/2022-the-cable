The speakers of the 36 houses of assembly in the country say they will support gender parity in the amendment of the country’s constitution. Speaking at an event in Abuja, Abubakar Suleiman, chairman of the conference of speakers of state parliament, said there is an urgent need to put women in decision making at different levels of government. Suleiman who is the speaker of the Bauchi state house of assembly said states that have domesticated the violence against persons prohibition (VAPP) law must ensure that it is implemented. “Very critical is the issue of constitution amendment, we are aware of the urgent need to support women’s representation in decision making. To this end, we pledge to support gender alterations in constitution amendment,” he said. “Violence against women remains one of the most widespread, prevalent, and largely unpunished violations of human rights in the world today. “Legislators at the national and state level are key stakeholders in the elimination of gender-based violence in all its forms and are strategically placed to drive the national changes required to achieve this aim. “We have both individual and collective responsibility to not only enact strong legislation but also to monitor the implementation of these policies and hold the executive arm of government accountable for making this legislation more effective. “We, therefore, commit to continuous partnership with civil society organisations particularly women rights organisations to support state action plans on ending gender-based violence through oversight roles.” On her part, Joy Ezeilo, chairperson of the Network of Sexual Assault Referral Centres in Nigeria, said 10 percent of ministerial appointments should be given to women. The professor said the eight states that are yet domesticate the VAPP law should do so to curb gender-based violence. Twenty-eight out of the 36 states have domesticated the VAPP law.
