Samuel Ortom, governor of Benue, says former vice-president Atiku Abubakar abandoned the people of the state during their trying times. Ortom spoke on Sunday when he received Atiku and his campaign team at the Benue government house. The Atiku Abubakar presidential campaign technical committee headed by Raymond Dokpesi, former chairman of Daar Communications, has been mobilising support for the presidential ambition of the former vice-president. Abubakar has however not announced if he will contest the 2023 presidential election. Speaking during the visit, Ortom said Abubakar should have visited the state when residents were under repeated attacks. The governor said the visit of the former vice-president — who holds the highest chieftaincy title in the state — is “long overdue”. “Your visit to Benue as the ‘Zege Mule U Tiv’ is long overdue. But it’s better late than never. You are in your home and we are happy to receive you,” the governor said. “But let me say here that our people were not happy that you didn’t visit when terrorist groups were attacking and killing the people in Benue.” Ortom alleged that the federal government is treating the killing of Benue residents by suspected herders with levity. He expressed optimism that the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) will salvage the country in 2023. On his part, the former vice-president said he was unable to visit the state earlier because he was out of the country for further education. Before leaving the state, Atiku donated the sum of N50 million for the welfare of internally displaced persons (IDPs).
