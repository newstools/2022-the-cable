The senate has confirmed Rhoda Gumus as a national commissioner (south-south) of the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC). Gumus, a nominee from Bayelsa state, is said to be a member of the All Progressives Congress (APC). Human Rights Writers Association of Nigeria (HURIWA), a civil society organisation (CSO), had petitioned Senate President Ahmad Lawan against her nomination. In the petition dated January 26 and acknowledged by the office of the senate president, Emmanuel Onwubiko, HURIWA national coordinator, said the CSO found documents proving that Gumus is a card-carrying member of the ruling party. The documents were said to have been attached to the petition. However, while presenting a report on the floor of the senate on Wednesday, Kabir Gaya, chairman of the INEC committee, said no petition against Gumus was received. “The nominees were asked questions and they answered soundly. Mr President, we only received one petition in regard to Major-General Alkali,” Gaya said. “But through the media, after we had submitted our report, we were hearing news about a different person (Gumus) again. The committee received a petition from Taraba elders against Alkali over incontinence.” Gaya said the elders wanted the north-east position to go to Taraba state. He, however, said the committee members dismissed the petition because the president has the prerogative to pick a nominee from any state in the north-east. Other nominees confirmed as national commissioners for INEC are Mohammed Haruna (north-central), May Agbamuche-Mbu (south-south), Ukeagu Nnamdi (south-east), and Sam Olumekum (south-west).
