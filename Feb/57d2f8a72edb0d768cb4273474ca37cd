Abdullahi Ganduje, Kano governor, has asked aggrieved members of the All Progressives Congress (APC) in the state to work together to move the party forward. The governor said this in reaction to the judgment of the appeal court which set aside a verdict of a lower court recognising the loyalists of Ibrahim Shekarau, a serving senator, as the authentic faction of the APC in Kano. Factions loyal to Ganduje and Shekarau have been at loggerheads over the leadership of the party in the state. The rift worsened when the party conducted ward, LGA and state congresses across the country. In Kano, different leaders emerged from the exercise — the Shekerau faction has Haruna Danzago as chairman, while Abdullahi Abbas is the leader of the Ganduje faction. In November 2021, the Shekarau faction secured an order from a federal capital territory (FCT) high court, nullifying the congress that produced Abbas. The ruling was, however, overturned at the Abuja court of appeal on Thursday. Speaking on Sunday at a stakeholder meeting, Ganduje called on the Shekarau faction to join hands with the APC leadership to move the party forward. “You can’t separate democracy from the crisis in developing countries, especially a state like Kano. But, the APC crisis in Kano is a fight between siblings which must be reconciled,” he said “Therefore, I called on the other faction to come and sheath their swords to join the train in order to take APC and Kano to the promised land. “This is not time to sleep and not the time to relax in the struggle to strengthen and move APC forward. “This will not also stop us from continuing with discharging our constitutional duty of executing developmental projects for the people of Kano.”
