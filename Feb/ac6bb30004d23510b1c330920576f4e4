Funmilayo Ogun, a former commissioner for works in Ekiti, has rejected her nomination as the deputy governorship candidate of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) in the state. According to NAN, Ogun disclosed her decision on Thursday in a letter addressed to Iyorchia Ayu, PDP national chairman. Ogun, who is also the secretary of the PDP in Ekiti, said despite the decision to reject the nomination, she remains supportive of the party. The former commissioner was reportedly nominated by party stakeholders to run with Bisi Kolawole, the governorship candidate who has the backing of Ayo Fayose, former Ekiti governor. “This is to formally inform you that I am not unaware of my nomination by Ekiti stakeholders for the position of the Deputy Governorship Candidate in the June 18 2022 gubernatorial election,” the letter reads. “Notwithstanding their good intentions, I formally write to reject the nomination for personal reasons. “However, I appreciate the uncommon recognition and I assure the party that no effort will be spared at ensuring our victory at the election.’’ Kolawole, a former chairman of the PDP in the state, was declared winner of the Ekiti PDP governorship primary held on January 26. The former Ekiti PDP chairman edged out Segun Oni, a former governor, and Kolapi Olusola, a former deputy governor, to clinch the party’s governorship ticket.
