Binta Nyako, a federal high court judge, has warned the Department of the State Services (DSS) against blocking the court premises and nearby roads ahead of the trial of Nnamdi Kanu, leader of the Indigenous People of Biafra. Kanu — who was rearraigned on a 15-count charge of treasonable felony– is due back in court on Wednesday. When the charges were read to him on January 19, 2022, the IPOB leader pleaded not guilty. In recent proceedings, operatives of the DSS, the Nigerian Army and officers of the Nigeria Police Force (NPF) had manned the entrance of the court and the streets leading to the court building. Journalists whose names failed to appear on a prepared list were not allowed near the premises while the staff of the court were searched before gaining entrance. In the same vein, lawyers whose cases were not found on the cause list were refused entry until the hearing is concluded. Addressing the situation, Nyako said security operatives should not take over the court’s security arrangement until 12 noon on Wednesday ahead of Kanu’s trial scheduled for 1pm. She said due to the massive security presence and blocking off roads leading to the court, hearings in other cases are cancelled or forced to endure “needless” adjournments each time Kanu’s trial is held. To allow for other matters to be heard before Kanu’s case, the judge fixed the trial for 1pm on Wednesday. She also directed the DSS director of legal services to convey the court’s decision to the highest authority of the service for implementation.
