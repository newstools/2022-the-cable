Vice-President Yemi Osinbajo, on Tuesday, paid a condolence visit to the parents of Hanifa, the five-year-old girl that was found murdered in Kano. Hanifa had been declared missing in December 2021, but in January, Abdulmalik Tanko, the proprietor of the school she attended, confessed to killing her with rat poison after keeping her in captivity her for weeks. According to Tanko, he kidnapped the girl on her way from school and demanded the sum of N6 million from her parents as ransom. He said of the N6 million demanded as ransom, he had collected N100,000 before Hanifa was killed, adding that “I used N71,000 to pay the staff members of the other branch”. Osinbajo visited Hanifa’s family after attending the 53rd conference of the National Association of Law Teachers, held in Kano. According to a statement by Laolu Akande, spokesperson to the vice-president, Osinbajo expressed condolences to the family on behalf of himself and President Muhammadu Buhari. On his part, Abubakar Abdulsalam, father of the slain schoolgirl, expressed appreciation to the vice-president for the visit. “I am rather speechless. I don’t have enough words to quantify my joy and gratitude over the visit of the vice-president to my family to condole me,” he was quoted as saying. “As I told him, it should be the other way round. The vice-president is our father. We are supposed to go and pay him a visit, not him coming to us. However, I am grateful; I am sincerely honoured. The only thing I will say is to pray for him and the entire nation that peace will reign.” See photos below. <img class="alignnone wp-image-660390" src="https://f5p3e9e4.stackpathcdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/WhatsApp-Image-2022-02-08-at-8.51.34-PM.jpeg" alt="" width="550" height="277" srcset="https://f5p3e9e4.stackpathcdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/WhatsApp-Image-2022-02-08-at-8.51.34-PM.jpeg 720w, https://f5p3e9e4.stackpathcdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/WhatsApp-Image-2022-02-08-at-8.51.34-PM-300x151.jpeg 300w, https://f5p3e9e4.stackpathcdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/WhatsApp-Image-2022-02-08-at-8.51.34-PM-24x12.jpeg 24w, https://f5p3e9e4.stackpathcdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/WhatsApp-Image-2022-02-08-at-8.51.34-PM-36x18.jpeg 36w, https://f5p3e9e4.stackpathcdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/WhatsApp-Image-2022-02-08-at-8.51.34-PM-48x24.jpeg 48w" sizes="(max-width: 550px) 100vw, 550px" /> <img class="wp-image-660358 alignnone" src="https://f5p3e9e4.stackpathcdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/WhatsApp-Image-2022-02-08-at-7.58.23-PM-1024x473.jpeg" alt="" width="550" height="254" srcset="https://f5p3e9e4.stackpathcdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/WhatsApp-Image-2022-02-08-at-7.58.23-PM-1024x473.jpeg 1024w, https://f5p3e9e4.stackpathcdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/WhatsApp-Image-2022-02-08-at-7.58.23-PM-300x139.jpeg 300w, https://f5p3e9e4.stackpathcdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/WhatsApp-Image-2022-02-08-at-7.58.23-PM-768x355.jpeg 768w, https://f5p3e9e4.stackpathcdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/WhatsApp-Image-2022-02-08-at-7.58.23-PM-24x11.jpeg 24w, https://f5p3e9e4.stackpathcdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/WhatsApp-Image-2022-02-08-at-7.58.23-PM-36x17.jpeg 36w, https://f5p3e9e4.stackpathcdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/WhatsApp-Image-2022-02-08-at-7.58.23-PM-48x22.jpeg 48w, https://f5p3e9e4.stackpathcdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/WhatsApp-Image-2022-02-08-at-7.58.23-PM.jpeg 1080w" sizes="(max-width: 550px) 100vw, 550px" />
