The Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) has nominated Shuaibu Isa Lau, senator representing Taraba north, as the deputy minority leader of the senate. Lau will replace Emmanuel Bwacha, senator representing Taraba south, who defected to the All Progressives Congress (APC) last week. President Muhammadu Buhari formally received Bwacha into the ruling party at a brief ceremony in the presidential villa. The senator’s letter formally announcing his defection to his colleagues was read on the floor of the upper legislative chamber on Tuesday. In a letter addressed to Senate President Ahmad Lawan, Iyorcha Ayu, national chairman of the PDP, said the party nominated Lau because the position is zoned to the north-east. Ayu said the Taraba north senator would be an asset to the leadership of the senate. “Following the defection of Senator Emmanuel Bwacha to the ruling APC, the PDP Senate caucus has nominated as his replacement, Senator Shuaibu Isa Lau,” he said. “Senator Lau is from Taraba state, the north-east geo-political zone of the country, where the position has been zoned. “The PDP senate caucus has duly informed the national headquarters of the party, in view of which we so communicate to you. “We believe that Senator Lau will be an asset to the leadership of the senate. Thank you and accept the assurances of our highest regards.”
