The federal government has made good its promise to support Usheoritse Itsekiri and Enoch Adegoke, two athletes who got injured while representing the country at the Tokyo 2020 Olympics. Itsekiri and Adegoke had suffered hamstring injuries while competing in the semifinals and final of the 100m men’s respectively last year. On Wednesday, Sunday Dare, minister of youths and sports development, presented the duo with the sum of N2,170,000 each in Abuja. According to him, the amount is for their medical bills and rehabilitation as earlier promised by the government. In their reaction, both athletes commended the minister for fulfilling his promise. They also said the gesture would boost their preparations for the new season. Adegoke was accelerating among the top four when he suddenly halted his canter while holding his stiffening right hamstring and was unable to end the race. He also became the first Nigerian man in 25 years to qualify for the final of the 100 meters at the Olympics. The Tokyo Olympics took place between July 23 and August 8, 2021. Nigeria’s participation at the last Olympics was trailed by several controversies believed to be responsible for the country’s unimpressive stint at the summer games.
