Nyesom Wike, governor of Rivers, says former Vice-President Atiku Abubakar is taking members of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) for granted on the issue of securing the presidential ticket. According to a statement by Kelvin Ebiri, Wike’s spokesman, the governor said this on Sunday in reaction to a comment made by Abubakar on winning the party’s presidential ticket. After a visit to former President Olusegun Obasanjo on Saturday, Abubakar had expressed confidence that he would win the PDP ticket. Speaking on the development, Wike said the former vice-president went too far with his comment. The governor, however, said he is committed to doing anything that will ensure PDP returns to power in 2023, and also urged party members to resist making “divisive utterances”. “I didn’t expect him frankly speaking to say that he will always take the ticket of the party. That is going too far and taking the delegates for granted,” he said. “People should watch. There will be shock as far as PDP convention is concerned. People should watch what is going to happen. People like to underrate so many persons and it is not good in politics.” Speaking on the timetable released by the Independent National Electoral Committee (INEC), Wike said the national executive committee (NEC) of the PDP will ensure the party abides by the guidelines issued by the electoral body. “We are a law-abiding party. The party will soon meet. The NEC will meet and find the way forward on how we will put our house in order and make sure we religiously follow the timetable of INEC without violating any provision of the law and guidelines that INEC may have produced,” he said. Wike also commended the PDP leadership in Plateau, Cross River, and Ondo states for the party’s performance in Saturday’s by-elections.
