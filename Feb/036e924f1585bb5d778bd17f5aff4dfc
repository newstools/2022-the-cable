Kylian Mbappe scored a last-minute winner to help Paris Saint-Germain (PSG) defeat Real Madrid 1-0 in the first leg of their UEFA Champions League (UCL) round of 16 encounter at the Parc des Princes Stadium in Paris on Tuesday night. Lionel Messi, the former Barcelona stalwart, who is playing against Real Madrid for the first time since leaving Spain last summer, also saw his spot-kick saved in the feisty encounter before Mbappe put the 13-time UCL winners to the sword with his last kick of the match. It was the free-flowing attack of PSG against a resolute Real Madrid defensive set-up in the first half while Angel Di Maria wasted the Paris club’s best chance, blazing wide from six yards with the goal gaping. Madrid, however, succeeded in limiting PSG to pot shots, with Messi, Nuno Mendes and Mbappe all trying their luck on goal towards the end of first half. The second period started in similar fashion as the first with PSG going close to scoring on several occasions through Mbappe, Messi and Di Maria. PSG’s efforts later earned a penalty as Dani Carvajal brought down Mbappe in the penalty area but Messi’s well struck penalty was excellently saved by Thibaut Courtois, Real Madrid goalkeeper. Undeterred, PSG continued to press for the winner with opportunities and Mbappe had the final word with an individual effort that saw him dribble past two defenders before slotting beyond Courtois’ legs for the winner. Real Madrid will have the opportunity to turn around the encounter in the second leg set for Spain in two weeks. In the other match of the night, Manchester City began their knockout stage journey with a 5-0 thrashing of Sporting Lisbon of Portugal at the Jose Alvalade Stadium in Lisbon. Bernardo Silva (brace), Riyad Mahrez, Phil Foden and Raheem Sterling all scored as the Pep Guardiola’s side battered the hapless Portuguese side. RESULTS
