Rotimi Adeleye, commanding officer, zone 12, Federal Road Safety Corps (FRSC), has warned officials against chasing erring motorists. The zonal commander said this on Saturday at a special walk to mark the FRSC’s 34th anniversary in Bauchi. He added that defaulters would face sanction. “This is a national directive of the corps. When found guilty of the action, the team involved in the chase may lose their jobs as it is not part of the operational ethics of the corps,” Adeleye said. “We have all what it takes to apprehend a vehicle and it is just a matter of identifying the vehicle with its number. “We can easily go to our database, get the details of the driver, the owner of the vehicle and quietly apprehend the vehicle.” He also listed some of the achievements of the corps since its establishment in 1988, adding that the FRSC is looking into improving efforts aimed at preventing road crashes and gridlock. “It could have been better for the corps if we could monitor traffic with ease, especially gridlock [using] helicopters,” he said. “We are also thinking of deploying drones during the yuletide. There are sophisticated drones that can travel miles or kilometres to get to the source of a problem. “The challenges are there but with the rate at which the corps is moving, we are living above it.”
