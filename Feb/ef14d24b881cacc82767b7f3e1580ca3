The sports ministry and the Nigeria Institute of International Affairs (NIIA) have partnered for the launch of ‘Conversations’, a series seeking to combine sports and diplomacy to drive Nigeria’s foreign policy agenda for Africa. In a statement, the ministry said the initiative was pioneered by Sunday Dare, sports minister, and Edosa Osaghae, director-general of the NIIA. According to Dare, the partnership — which is the first of its kind — is aimed at exploring the potentials of sports as a powerful tool for development. “This partnership, which is the first of its kind, will explore and extend the frontiers of sports as a powerful tool for development in line with our ministry’s National Sports Industry Policy projections,” he said. The series is expected to feature contributions from several experts including Idorenyin Uyoe, the sports scholar and seasoned marketer based in the United States. Also contributing is Ron Freeman, the 1968 Olympics double medalist who doubles as a diplomat, humanitarian and peace activist. The series will also feature Ikaweba Bunting, director of the department of unity for the Mwalimu Nyerere Foundation in Tanzania. The ‘Conversations’ is scheduled to hold on Thursday at the NIIA headquarters in Victoria Island, Lagos state.
