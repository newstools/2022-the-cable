Egypt overcame Cameroon 3-1 on penalties in their pulsating semi-final encounter at the Olembe Stadium in Yaounde to book a place in the final of the African Cup of Nations (AFCON). Following a nerve-wracking 0-0 draw after regulation and extra time, it was the Pharaohs that ruled over their expectant hosts, silencing the crowd with their impeccable penalty kicks to eliminate the Lions of Cameroon. Egypt have now triumphed in four of its past five matches against Cameroon, progressing to their eighth AFCON final. It was also revenge on Cameroon who won the 2017 AFCON at the expense of the Pharaohs. Cameroon, however, have lost a fourth semi-final encounter in their sixth appearance at the last-four stage of AFCON. During tonight’s encounter, it was Cameroon that came out flying from the start and had the better openings, hitting the post in both halves as they searched for a way through the tricky Egyptians who stoutly defended. Mohamed Salah and Mostafa Mohamed both went close but could not beat Andre Onana, the Cameroon goalkeeper. The North Africans nearly won it in extra time but could not connect with a gilt-edged opportunity before stunning the shell-shocked hosts during the shootout. Harold Moukoudi and Jean Onana saw their penalties saved by Mohamed Abou Gabal, while Clint Njie missed the target as Egypt converted all three of their kicks to eliminate the hosts. Carlos Queiroz’s Egypt will play Senegal in the AFCON final, with Salah and Sadio Mane, Liverpool players, facing each other in the showpiece set for Sunday, February 6.
