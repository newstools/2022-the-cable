Kayode Fayemi, governor of Ekiti, has launched his book titled, ‘Unfinished Greatness: Envisioning a New Nigeria’. The public presentation of the book took place on Thursday at the NAF conference centre in Abuja. The book presentation ceremony was chaired by Yakubu Gowon, former head of state. Some of those present at the book launch included three governors — Babajide Sanwo-Olu of Lagos, Abdullahi Ganduje of Kano, and Dapo Abiodun of Ogun — as well as Ibrahim Gambari, chief of staff to the president, who represented President Muhammadu Buhari. Presenting a chapter-by-chapter review of the book, Joe Abah, a former director-general of the Bureau of Public Service Reforms (BPSR), said the book makes a compelling argument for the need to restructure Nigeria. “It also highlights the imperative of intelligent, people-focused leadership anchored on personal example. It is unapologetically optimistic about the future of Nigeria as a coherent entity founded on unity, freedom, justice and equity,” he said. “The book is a useful contribution to the debate about the future of Nigeria at a time when many Nigerians and lovers of Nigeria are wondering whether and when Nigeria would ever fulfil its undoubted potential. “Unlike many publications that focus only on setting out the problems, Fayemi’s book goes further to outline practical suggestions for tackling some of the thorniest issues in our polity today. I have enjoyed reading the book ‘Unfinished Greatness’ and would recommend it to all.” Speaking at the event, Gambari said it is Buhari’s view that the more people of vision write, the better for the society because they will leave books to chart a course for the society. “We need more books and articles on the future of our country. It is important that this book should be read, practicalised,” he said. The event also featured a panel session with Waziri Adio, former executive secretary of the Nigeria Extractive Industries Transparency Initiative (NEITI); Yemi Adamolekun, executive director of Enough is Enough (EiE); Ndi Kato, executive director of Dinidari Africa; and Hamzat Lawal, founder of Connected Development (CODE), as panelists. Speaking during the session, Adio said the country has not properly managed its diversity, which is one of its strengths. He, however, said there is so much to be hopeful for as the country “has a lot of potential”. On her part, Kato spoke on the need for women participation for the country to achieve greatness. “It’ll be foolhardy to say this nation is going somewhere when half of the population is being left behind,” she said. On his part, Lawal said everyone can participate in making Nigeria great, and urged leaders to reach out to people at the grassroots, regardless of differences. “I believe the solution must be homegrown. The solution must be local and I believe we need to talk to ourselves more,” he said.
