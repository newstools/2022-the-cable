Sunday Dare, minister of youth and sports development, has paid his tribute to Emmanuel Sunny Ojeagbase, founder and executive chairman of Complete Communications Limited, publisher of Complete Sports and Success Digest. Ojeagbase passed on in Atlanta, USA on February 26 after a brief illness. He was aged 71 at the time of his death. He was one of the nation’s foremost sports writers with impactful career working in established media organisations like Daily Times, The Guardian and Concord before launching into private publication business in 1984 with popular and widely read titles Complete Football, Sports Souvenir, International Soccer Review (ISR) and a motivational journal, Success Digest. Dare, in a statement on Monday, prayed that God should comfort the late publisher’s family, friends and colleagues and give them the fortitude to bear the huge loss which he described as “monumental”.
