Volodymyr Zelenskyy, Ukraine’s president, says the country will give weapons to anyone who wants to defend the country. Zelenskyy made the declaration via his Twitter handle on Thursday. Vladimir Putin, Russia president, had ordered a special military operation in Ukraine’s Donbas region on Thursday morning and asked Ukrainian troops to put down their arms. But Zelenskyy countered Putin’s order, saying Ukraine will not give up its freedom but will defend itself “no matter what Moscow thinks”. “We will give weapons to anyone who wants to defend the country. Be ready to support Ukraine in the squares of our cities,” Zelenskyy tweeted. “Russia treacherously attacked our state in the morning, as Nazi Germany did in world war II years. “As of today, our countries are on different sides of world history. Russia has embarked on a path of evil, but Ukraine is defending itself & won’t give up its freedom no matter what Moscow thinks.” The BBC reported Zelenskyy as saying he had sought talks with Putin, but got no response. He said his country was ready for a Russian attack, vowing that Ukraine will not shy away from the war but face it upfront. “I initiated a telephone call with the president of the Russian federation. Result: silence,” Zelensky said. “If they [Russia] attack, if they try to take our county – our freedom, our lives, the lives of our children – we will be defending ourselves. “As you attack, it will be our faces you see, not our backs.”
