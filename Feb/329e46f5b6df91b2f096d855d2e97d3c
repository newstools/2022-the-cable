The federal government has asked the authorities in the United Arab Emirates (UAE) to approve the request by Air Peace for the resumption of passenger flights. The FG said this in a letter addressed to Saif Mohammed Al Suwaid, director-general (DG) of the UAE’s General Civil Aviation Authority (GCAA). The letter, dated February 1, was signed by Musa Nuhu, DG of the Nigerian Civil Aviation Authority (NCAA). According to the letter, Nuhu said Emirates Airline, the flag carrier of the UAE, can resume scheduled flights to Nigeria whenever it likes. “I wish to inform you that the Safety Decision Issue 24 has been accepted by Nigeria Authorities after a review by relevant parties,” the letter reads. “Consequently, Emirates Airlines can resume scheduled passenger flight operations to Nigeria at its convenience. “I wish to bring to the notice of HE that the Nigerian Operator Air Peace Airlines has submitted its request to UAE Authorities for resumption of scheduled passenger flights between the two countries effective 01 March 2022. “Nigerian Civil Aviation Authority re-affirms its assurances of the highest esteem to General Civil Aviation Authority of United Arab Emirates.” Air Peace had requested a slot of three weekly flights from Nigeria to Sharjah Airport in UAE, but only one was granted. The UAE’s GCAA blamed the airline for pulling out of Sharjah Airport and “so should not expect to retain its flight frequency there” — a claim Air Peace has denied. In retaliation to the UAE’s treatment of Air Peace, the federal government cut Emirate’s slots from 21 to just one, causing Emirates to pull out of the Nigerian route indefinitely. Following the concession of six slots to Air Peace, both at the Dubai and Sharjah airports, the federal government had, in December, reinstated Emirates’ flight schedule to Nigeria.
