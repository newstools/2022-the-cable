The International Centre for Investigative Reporting (ICIR) has announced the appointment of Ajibola Amzat as its new managing editor. Before his elevation, Amzat was the editor of the ICIR’s news website, www.icirnigeria.org. Victoria Bamas, who was the editor/team lead of FactCheckHub, ICIR’s fact-checking operation, is now ICIR’s new editor. The centre also announced the appointment of Temitayo Odunlami as ICIR’s regional editor, south-west. Other announcements made include the elevation of Odinaka Anudu, former news editor, to deputy editor, and Opeyemi Kehinde moved from head of digital content unit/deputy lead, FactCheckHub to become editor of FactCheckHub. Ihuoma Chidozie, the former political editor, moved to the position of news editor while Gbenga Adanikin of the FactCheckHub now becomes the head of ICIR’s investigative desk. Stanley Olaleke also becomes head of the centre’s ICT unit. Adeolu Kilanko was named programmes manager at the programmes department, while Gloria Agema is the new deputy programmes manager. Rosemary Igbeka was also elevated to the finance manager position of the non-profit organisation. The appointments, according to Dayo Aiyetan, executive director of ICIR, were made to reposition ICIR as a key player in Nigeria’s media industry. He said that in adapting to the realities of the times, ICIR would be exploring new economic sustainability models to secure the future of the media organisation, including launching its online newspaper before the end of the year. He said the launch will coincide with the centre’s 10th anniversary celebration, which is scheduled for later this year. The anniversary celebrations, according to Aiyetan, would be an ideal time to establish the organisation’s New York office.
