The house of representatives committee on public account has summoned Godwin Emefiele, governor of the Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN), over non-disclosure of recovered funds. The committee also summoned Osagie Ehanire, minister of health; Isa Pantami, minister of communication and digital economy; Babatunde Fashola, minister of works and housing; Rauf Aregbesola, minister of interior. Fashola and Aregbesola are to appear before the lawmakers with their permanent secretaries and directors of finance. Oluwole Oke, chairman of the committee, issued the summon on Tuesday. The committee is investigating the alleged non-disclosure of $40.52 million recovered funds between 2016-2019 raised by the office of the auditor-general of the federation. Oke said the committee issued the summons due to the reluctance of the public officials to honour previous invitations of the committee. “We have invited the ministry of works, and over five times they have written us to ask for more times, we cannot continue like this,” Oke said. “For the last time, even though the permanent secretary is the chief account of the ministry pursuant to section 20 of Procurement Act, do (clerk) a letter to the minister. “Copy the chief of staff to the president and the secretary-general of the federation and the attorney-general of the federation. “That the minister should bring the permanent secretary, director of finance to appear before this committee within seven days. “Similarly, this ruling applies to the ministry of interior, the minister should bring the permanent secretary, the CG immigration, the CG fire service and CG civil defence. “Same applies to the federal ministry of health, the Primary Healthcare Development Agency and the ministry of communication and digital economy.” The committee asked the CBN to avail the lawmakers with account statements of all foreign reserve accounts.
