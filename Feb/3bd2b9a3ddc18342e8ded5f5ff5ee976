National Drug Law Enforcement Agency (NDLEA) says it has arrested Abdulmumini Maikasuwa, a 52-year-old man, for attempting to circulate fake $4,760,000. Femi Babafemi, the NDLEA spokesperson, disclosed this in a statement issued on Sunday. Babafemi said operatives of the agency intercepted the money sent from Lagos to Abuja at the Abaji area of the federal capital territory (FCT) last Friday. According to him, Maikasuwa was arrested after a controlled delivery of the parcelled counterfeit US dollars totalling $4,760,000. The seizure, according to Babafemi, was prompted by intelligence acquired by the agency’s FCT command, which detailed the movement of the cash. The spokesperson said Buba Marwa, chairman of the agency, has directed that the cash and the suspect in NDLEA custody be transferred to EFCC for further investigation. Meanwhile, the NDLEA said it also arrested one Rashidat Adebayo, a 38-year-old nursing mother, with drugs such as Tramadol, Swinol, Diazepam and Pentazocine injection ampules in Offa, Kwara state. Babafemi said that her arrest came barely three weeks after she was granted administrative bail following an earlier arrest for dealing in illicit drugs. “Before her latest arrest on Thursday, February 17, the nursing mother had been arrested and granted bail on January 24 for dealing in similar drugs,” he said. Similarly, NDLEA said two other suspects, Sani Isa (aka Bilaz) and Bala Yerima, have been arrested in Hong, Adamawa state, with 239 blocks of cannabis sativa weighing 209kg. Babafemi said NDLEA operatives, Bauchi command, also intercepted a truck marked FFF 422 XB going from Lagos to Maiduguri at Azare, Bauchi. “A total of 164.8kg of Cannabis Sativa concealed in peak milk cartons was recovered from the truck,” Babafemi said.
