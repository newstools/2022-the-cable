Isa Pantami, the minister of communication and digital economy, has formally handed over the spectrum of the fifth-generation (5G) network to the Nigeria Communications Commission (NCC). Pantami said this in Abuja while giving a keynote address during the public workshop on national policy on 5G networks and spectrum allocation for deployment on Thursday. The minister said the allocation of bulk spectrum to the NCC is based on its regulatory roles. “We are here today to officially allocate the 3.5GHz frequency band, specifically the 3.52GHz to 3.90GHz (or 380 MHz), to the Nigerian Communications Commission (NCC) for onward assignment to the winners of the 5G auctioning process. The initial allocation is done under the auspices of the National Frequency Management Council (NFMC),” Pantami said. The minister said 148 spectrum allocations had been made since 2019. “5G networks offer major advantages over technologies that preceded it. These advantages include much lower latency, higher bandwidth, greater device density, longer battery life for nodes and greater network flexibility,” he added. “According to the GSMA, as at the end of December 2021, 200 mobile operators in 78 countries/territories have announced 3GPP compatible 5G service launches (either mobile or fixed wireless access), including about 9 countries in Africa. With our population and market size, we are on course to become the country with the largest 5G deployment in Africa.” In December 2021, after 11 rounds of bidding that lasted for eight hours, Mafab Communication and MTN Nigeria emerged as the two successful winners of the 3,5gigahertz (GHz) spectrum auction for the deployment of 5G technology in Nigeria.
