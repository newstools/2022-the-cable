Raheem Sterling scored a hat-trick as Manchester City defeated Norwich City 4-0 in their English Premier League (EPL) encounter at Carrow Road on Saturday evening. Phil Foden was also on target as the EPL champions scored in both halves to move twelve points ahead of Liverpool at the top of the league table, while also ending Norwich’s three-match unbeaten league run. Sterling scored the breakthrough goal on 31 minutes, profiting from Kyle Walker’s cross to curl a shot into the top corner. Foden then latched on to a poor clearance to hook a shot over the line early in the second half before Sterling added a third with a header into an empty net. Sterling also scored a penalty on 90 minutes to complete his hat-trick. The victory is Man City’s 14th league win in 15 matches as Pep Guardiola’s team has accumulated 63 points from 25 matches. In earlier matches, Man United, City’s neighbour, faltered in the race for a top-four position, dropping points as they were held to a 1-1 draw by Southampton at Old Trafford. Jadon Sancho gave the Red Devils the lead on 21 minutes but Southampton equalized through Che Adams three minutes into the second half and held on for a point. Ralf Rangnick’s side remain in fifth position with 40 points but have played two or more games than Arsenal and Tottenham who are one and four points respectively behind Man United. Frank Lampard enjoyed his first win as Everton manager, as his side overcame Leeds United 3-0 to keep the Toffees further away from relegation trouble. RESULTS
