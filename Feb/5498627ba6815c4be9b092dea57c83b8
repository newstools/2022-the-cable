Atedo Peterside, the founder of Stanbic IBTC Bank Plc and Anap Foundation, has commended President Muhammadu Buhari for signing the electoral act amendment bill into law. The president signed the bill on Friday at a ceremony held at the federal executive council (FEC) chamber in the presidential villa in Abuja. Senate President Ahmad Lawan, Femi Gbajabiamila, speaker of the house of representatives, and Kayode Fayemi, chairman of the Nigeria Governors Forum (NGF), were among the dignitaries present at the ceremony. In a post on his official Twitter page, Peterside thanked Buhari for approving the electoral bill, which he said “constitutes a significant improvement over previous legislation”. “The #GoNigeria movement wishes to thank Mr President, our Legislators, Civil Society etc. for this team effort,” he added.

The president said the provision “violates the spirit of democracy”. However, the national assembly reviewed the bill to provide for indirect, direct as well as consensus methods for selecting candidates. Meanwhile, another approved recommendation in the electoral act is the electronic transmission of election results.
