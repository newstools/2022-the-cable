Power generation dropped by 630 megawatts (MW) following a fire outbreak at the Egbin Power Plant in Ikorodu, Lagos state. The development has led to the shutdown of power generation by the company, coupled with the load reduction mechanism adopted by the Transmission Company of Nigeria (TCN) to prevent system collapse. In a statement issued on Friday, the company said the fire incident occurred at its power plant on Wednesday at about 4.20pm, leading to a blackout in Lagos state. The fire outbreak was said to have been contained by a team of firefighters in collaboration with firefighters from the Nigeria Gas Company (NGC) in Egbin. The company said it has set out a process to determine the cause of the fire incident. Speaking on the implications, Ndidi Mba, TCN’s spokesperson, told ThisDay that the fire incident led to the removal of 630MW from the national grid. “We know that there was a fire outbreak and the total generation of 630MW was removed from the grid because of that,” Mba said. “You know, when a fire outbreak happens, even if it doesn’t affect the entire units, the tendency is that to protect the other ones, you shut them down. “So, as I said, 630mw was removed from the grid on that day (Wednesday).” Meanwhile, electricity consumers in the state and its environs have been witnessing irregular power outages for days — affecting Ikeja Electric (IE) and Eko Electricity Distribution Company (EKEDC).
