Wale Okediran, former member of the house of representatives, says Bola Ige, former attorney-general of the federation, was a respected mentor who did not portray himself as a political godfather. Ige, who was the attorney-general of the federation under the administration of former President Olusegun Obasanjo, was killed on December 23, 2001. Speaking in an interview on ‘Parrot Xtra/Ayekooto’, a programme on Splash 105.5FM, Okediran said the late attorney-general groomed his mentees without harassment and threats. The former lawmaker said he started out as a personal physician to Ige before he was persuaded by him to join partisan politics. “Bola Ige was a mentor and he never behaved, conducted or portrayed himself as a godfather. He was my mentor and he was well respected by me. He was the one who persuaded me and the likes of Professor Sola Adeyeye to join politics,” he said. “He was a respected politician and once he had groomed you, he would not harass or torment his mentees to bring him proceeds or threaten them with second term. He was a leader of leaders. “I met Chief Bola Ige at his home during one of the meetings of our Association of Nigerian Authors (ANA). He was one of us because he had books he wrote and published. “One day, he interviewed me to know more about me and I told him that I am a medical practitioner. He was thrilled. He then declared that he was appointing me as his personal physician. “I accepted and along the line, I started to follow him to political meetings and campaigns. Their meetings used to amuse me and I used to laugh. “He noticed and asked me what I felt about joining politics. He then encouraged me saying we professionals should not keep away from partisan politics. I will say here that I have also been encouraging fellow professionals to join too.”
