As minister of agriculture, I turned to the power of technology, mobile phones, to provide 15 million farmers with access to improved seeds and fertilizers, end corruption in the sector. It was revolutionary –the first, not only in Africa, but in the world. It helped Nigeria to produce a record additional 21 million metric tons of food. It boosted food security and expanded wealth for farmers, from the north east, north west, north central, southwest, east, and south-south of the country. It brought transparency and accountability in use of public funds.” While congratulating the graduates, Adesina said the AfDB is working towards creating more jobs and preparing the youths to become leaders of the new digital economy. Adesina with Abdulsalami  “The African Development Bank is preparing the youth of Africa to lead in the new digital economy. We have just provided $ 170 million to Nigeria to help drive its I-DICE initiative that will help expand the digital industry and grow jobs in the creative industries,” he added. “You have been shaped in Minna, for export to other parts of Nigeria, Africa, and the world. Build a new Nigeria, a smart Nigeria, a dynamic Nigeria and a  globally competitive Nigeria. It is in your hands. Now go and make it happen! I wish you good success and God’s richest blessings. Congratulations!”
