Two groups known as the Higher Nigeria Movement (HNM) and The Progressive Project (TPP) say the youth will be mobilised to massively participate in the 2023 general election. In a statement on Wednesday after holding a meeting in Abuja, the groups said mobilising the votes of youths is key to winning the presidency for Vice-President Yemi Osinbajo. They also said concerned non-partisan Nigerians will back the vice-president’s bid. “More than before, youth votes will matter much and make a big difference in 2023,” Usman Aliyu Usman, TPP national coordinator, said at the meeting. On his part, Adeniyi Ibrahim, HNM national coordinator, said his organisation commenced a road show in Kwara state on Tuesday to call on Nigerians to vote for Osinbajo if he declares his intention to run. “We have had several meetings and appointed leaders in all the nation’s thirty-six states and the federal capital territory, we had our flag-off in Kwara state on Tuesday while the Nasarawa state rally took place on Wednesday,” Ibrahim said. “On Thursday, we shall be having that of Abuja and next week, it will be the turn of about six successive states, including Kaduna where we have scheduled a programme on February 9. “Right from the first rally in Kwara, the response has been massive and we are seeing great positive possibilities in our effort to rally support for the 2023 presidential candidature of Professor Yemi Osinbajo.”
