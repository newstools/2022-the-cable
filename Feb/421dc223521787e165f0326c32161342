The national caretaker committee of the All Progressives Congress (APC), on Thursday, inaugurated party chairpersons for 34 states and the federal capital territory (FCT). TheCable had reported that the party members had converged on the headquarters of the APC in Abuja for the inauguration amid heavy security. Mai Mala Buni, chairman of the caretaker/extraordinary convention planning committee (CECPC) — represented by John Akpanudoedehe, secretary of the committee — inaugurated the state chairpersons, excluding those of Kano and Sokoto. The development comes weeks before the party’s national convention scheduled for February 26. The party didn’t state exact reasons for excluding Sokoto and Kano. However, while there is an ongoing court case involving the APC in Kano, party crisis in Sokoto had resulted in parallel congresses.
