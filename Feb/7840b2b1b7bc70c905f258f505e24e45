The Federal Airports Authority of Nigeria (FAAN) says it is conducting a “routine maintenance” of conveyor belts at the Lagos airport. In a statement on Wednesday, Henrietta Yakubu, general manager, corporate affairs of FAAN, dismissed reports suggesting a breakdown in the airport’s baggage handling system. She said the maintenance is part of FAAN’s efforts to ensure optimal performance of facilities at the Lagos airport. Yakubu appealed to passengers and other aviation stakeholders to exercise patience with the agency as regards the maintenance work. “Contrary to misinformation presently making the rounds online as depicted by some pictures posted suggesting a breakdown in the baggage processing system at the Murtala Muhammed International Airport, Lagos, the Federal Airport Authority of Nigeria wishes to inform passengers and the general public that what is going on is routine maintenance of the conveyor belts,” the statement reads. “The process is in line with our facilities maintenance program, aimed at ensuring optimal performance of the airport’s facilities. “We, therefore, appeal to our highly esteemed stakeholders to please bear with us, as the maintenance work will soon be completed.” Last week, FAAN unveiled its plan to expand the General Aviation Terminal (GAT) of the Lagos airport. It, however, warned that the project would hamper passenger facilitation at the terminal.
