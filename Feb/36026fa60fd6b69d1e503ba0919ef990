Three kinsmen of Samuel Ortom, governor of Benue, have been reportedly killed by suspected herdsmen. The gunmen were said to have attacked on Saturday at 5 pm when they blocked the Lordye-Gbajimba road in Guma LGA of Benue state. Nathaniel Ikyur, chief press secretary to Ortom, in a statement, said the victims — two males and females — were on a motorcycle when they were ambushed and shot dead by the gunmen. “The victims were riding on a motorcycle when they were ambushed and shot dead by the killer herdsmen who have taken over parts of the local government bordering Nasarawa state,” the statement reads. “Security agencies who recovered the bodies said those shot died on the spot from gunshot wounds while the other was brutally macheted to death. “Soldiers attached to operation whirl stroke recovered the bodies and deposited the corpses at Gbajimba general hospital. “This has been the plight of Benue indigenes in the hands of fulani herdsmen who have invaded the state in a bid to take over our ancestral lands.” Over the past few years, Benue has experienced a spate of violent attacks perpetrated by gunmen, which led to the destruction of properties and the killings of residents. In April 2021, Ortom asked President Muhammadu Buhari to declare a state of emergency over Nigeria’s deteriorating security situation. The Benue governor made the call after suspected herdsmen killed seven persons during an attack on an internally displaced persons (IDP) camp in the Abagena community.
