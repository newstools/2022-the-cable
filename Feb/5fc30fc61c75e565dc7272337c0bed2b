Omoyele Sowore, Sahara Reporters publisher, has alleged that there was an attempt to assassinate him and some of his associates by “sponsored thugs”. Sowore said the incident took place on Thursday in Abuja. He alleged that they were attacked while heading to the appeal court to attend the hearing of a suit challenging the declaration of Leonard Nzenwa as the acting chairman of the African Action Congress (AAC). Sowore had filed an appeal challenging the judgement of the federal high court recognising Nzenwa as acting AAC chairman. The publisher said some activists and members of the AAC were assaulted and their phones taken, when the vehicle conveying them was stopped by gunmen. He bemoaned what he described as the tactics of using security agents dressed as vigilantes to attack activists. Today again, the @mbuhari/@ProfOsinbajo regime sent assassins to trail us on our way to the Court of Appeal, they cut off the rear vehicle conveying our comrades and @aacparty members. They were brutally assaulted and all their phones taken away! #WeCantcintinueLikeThis pic.twitter.com/I8uDgDuprn — Omoyele Sowore (@YeleSowore) February 24, 2022  The @mbuhari regime has consistently sent the same set of people to attack me during Court appearances of @MaziNnamdiKanu and also used the police and DSS to carry out these attacks. We are aware that the attacks are coordinated by the DSS and rogue @policeng officers in the FCT — Omoyele Sowore (@YeleSowore) February 24, 2022  These latest tactic of using security agents dressed as vigilante/hunters have become persistent but we are unwavering in our commitment to see to it that the regime is disgraced so that our people could have a new lease of life. #RevolutionNow #WeCantContinueLikeThis — Omoyele Sowore (@YeleSowore) February 24, 2022  In January 2022, Sowore had alleged that there was an assassination attempt on his life during the trial of Nnamdi Kanu, leader of the Indigenous People of Biafra, at the federal high court.
