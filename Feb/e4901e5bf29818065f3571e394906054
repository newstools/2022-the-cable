Aliko Dangote, Nigerian billionaire businessman, says he will continue to support government’s efforts to develop sports in the country. He spoke on Thursday when visited the recently renovated Moshood Abiola National Stadium pitch adopted by him under the adopt-a-pitch initiative of Sunday Dare, sports minister. The entrepreneur, whose company, Dangote Industries Group, sponsored the rehabilitation of the pitch, expressed satisfaction with the job done as he toured the sprawling facility. “Rest assured of our continued support and you can always knock on our doors. Nigerians have very strong love for sports, so I think we need to complement government’s efforts to ensure that everything works,” he said. On his part, Dare commended Dangote for supporting the development of sports, adding that he is the first person to embrace the stadium-adoption policy. “I want to thank you for investing in the development of our sports and the fruit of that partnership has blossomed into what we see here today,” he said. “I would like to inform you that we have just received CAF certification of this stadium for international matches, which means that the World Cup qualifiers next month will be played here. This wouldn’t have been possible without your support.” The revamped stadium is already completed with nursery beds, two digital score boards, 24 sprinklers and two-year maintenance. The project is part of the contract reached with Dangote Industries under the public-private-partnership initiative of the sports ministry. Daura Stadium in Katsina has also been completed, while the National Stadium in Lagos is expected to be completed in May this year.
