More than 20 residents have been reported missing following an attack by gunmen in Ruwan Godiya village in Faskari LGA of Katsina state. The gunmen were said to have invaded the village on motorcycles on Sunday night, shooting sporadically into the air. Gambo Isah, police public relations officer of the state, confirmed the incident to TheCable. Gambo, however, said contrary to reports, 29 residents of the village are missing. He said the police command is trying to investigate if the missing persons were kidnapped or if they ran away from the village to safety. “Yes, there was an attack on Ruwan Godiya village. Report from the DPO of the area said the whereabouts of about 29 persons are unknown,” Isah said. “We can’t say if the villagers ran away for their lives to escape being attacked or the bandits kidnapped them. That is what we are trying to investigate. “Already, there is a deployment of military in the area to restore calm.” Last Thursday, about 12 persons were feared killed when gunmen attacked Illela village in Safana LGA of the state. The gunmen reportedly came to attack a “repentant bandit, Mani Turwa”, who was said to be protecting the community. The gunmen were said to have engaged in a gun duel with Turwa’s team but they were repelled. The development was said to have resulted in a reprisal attack, which led to the killing of residents, while houses were set ablaze.
