The Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) says it will hold a meeting on Saturday over the implementation of the electoral bill 2022. On Friday, President Muhammadu Buhari finally signed the electoral act amendment bill into law. Buhari had initially rejected the bill after the national assembly made direct primary compulsory for political parties in the country. The president said the provision “violates the spirit of democracy”. Consequently, the senate and house of representatives reworked the bill to provide for indirect and direct primary, as well as consensus candidates. In a statement issued by Festus Okoye, national commissioner and chairman, information and voter education committee, INEC said the signing of the bill is historic. “It contains many progressive provisions that will facilitate the conduct of free, fair and credible elections in Nigeria,” the statement reads. “The nation now has the Electoral Act 2022 which replaces the Electoral Act 2010 (as amended). Together with the 1999 Constitution (as amended), the new Act constitutes the principal law to govern the conduct of future elections, including the 2023 General Election.” INEC said given the tight timelines contained in the new law, it fully appreciates the importance of proceeding with their implementation in earnest. “Consequently, an extraordinary meeting of the Commission is scheduled for tomorrow Saturday 26th February 2022. Thereafter, a statement will be issued on the way forward,” the statement reads. In the newly signed electoral bill, parties are now at liberty to use indirect, direct primary, as well as the consensus option to elect their candidates for any election that will be organised by INEC. Electronic transmission of election results is also part of the new provisions in the bill.
