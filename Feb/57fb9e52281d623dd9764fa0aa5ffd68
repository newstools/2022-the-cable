The Bauchi house of assembly has called for the conversion of a secondary school in the state into a health facility. The development comes after Danlami Kawule, member representing Zungur/Galambi constituency, presented a motion calling for the conversion at plenary on Tuesday. Kawule said the Government Secondary School, Baban Takko, located in Gwallameji area, had turned into a criminal hideout. He said the institution, which is now allegedly a hideout for criminals and persons involved in the consumption of illicit drugs, is becoming a threat to residents of the area. According to NAN, Kawule appealed to the house to seek the assistance of relevant agencies to convert the school into health centre or any government facility that would be helpful to the community. Speaking on the development, Abubakar Sulaiman, speaker of the house, said the house committee on security should liaise with the office of the secretary to the state government to look into the situation. On his part, Tijjani Aliyu, member representing Azare/Madangala constituency, advised that the house committee on security work with the security agencies to address the situation before it becomes a national issue.
