Super Falcons qualified for the 2022 Africa Women’s Cup of Nations (AWCON) following a slim victory over Cote d’Ivoire at the Stade Robert Champroux on Wednesday. The Super Falcons needed a positive result to qualify for the tournament after enjoying a 2-0 win over the Lady Elephants in the first leg. A brace from Ifeoma Onumonu, the US–based forward, last Friday had helped  the nine-time African champions secured the win against the Ivorians in the first leg fixture at the Moshood Abiola Stadium in Abuja. In the same vein, the Randy Waldrum girls won the return leg 1-0, thanks to Esther Okoronkwo’s late strike in Abidjan. Francisca Ordega, Rasheedat Ajibade, Onumonu, Rita Chikwelu, Regina Otu and Chiamaka Nnadozie were named in the Super Falcons starting XI by the coach. In the thrilling encounter, the Ivorians were all over their Nigerian foes and bombarded them. Cote d’Ivoire should have raced in front but the heroics of Nnadozie denied them the curtain raiser. The Paris FC keeper made a crucial save from the penalty spot after the half hour. It was 0-0 at the break in the capital of Cote d’Ivoire. In the second half, the two sides continued to fight for the ball with both teams hoping to snatch the victory. With a few minutes left on the clock, Esther Okoronkwo, Saint Etienne striker, silenced the home team with the all important goal for Nigeria.
