Still caught in the middle of a police probe that has lasted over five months and possible extradition to the US over his alleged involvement with Hushpuppi, a self-confessed internet fraudster, Abba Kyari, the suspended deputy commissioner of police (DCP), is in the news again. Kyari may not have foreseen his recent arrest over alleged links to a “cocaine deal”. Less than three weeks ago, he was in high spirits while attending the wedding ceremony of the son of the inspector-general of police (IGP) in Borno. On Monday, the National Drug Law Enforcement Agency (NDLEA) declared the super cop wanted “over his involvement in a 25kg cocaine deal”. Hours later, the police announced his arrest and subsequent transfer to the NDLEA’s custody. The developments have been coming in rapidly — and these are what the police and the NDLEA have so far revealed about the case. According to the IGP, the investigation carried out by the police revealed that “the international narcotics cartel involved in the case has strong ties with some NDLEA officers who are on their payroll”. Meanwhile, Kyari was arrested alongside four other officers — Sunday Ubuah, Bawa James, Simon Agrigba and John Nuhu. One John Umoru, identified as an assistant superintendent of police (ASP), is said to be at large.
