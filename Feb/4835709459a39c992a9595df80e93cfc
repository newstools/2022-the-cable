Bola Tinubu, a chieftain of the All Progressives Congress (APC), has informed Nigerian youths that they will become presidents of the country after him. There has been clamour for youths to occupy top political positions in the country, which gave birth to the #NotTooYoungToRun movement. Speaking on Sunday when he visited Lamidi Adeyemi, the Alaafin of Oyo, at the palace, Tinubu asked the youths to create room for elderly people. “You won’t allow the elderly ones to pass and you haven’t become president. What if you become president, will you chase us out of town?” Tinubu asked. “You will grow old and become president. But I will become the president first.” In January, Tinubu visited President Muhammadu Buhari during which he announced his intention to contest the presidency in 2023. The former Lagos governor has been travelling across the country to consult with stakeholders over his presidential ambition. In January, Tinubu visited Oyo state over the deaths of Jimoh Oyewumi, the Soun of Ogbomoso; Saliu Adetunji, the Olubadan of Ibadanland, and Alao-Akala, former governor of Oyo. He also met with Seyi Makinde, the state governor, in Ibadan. On January 20, he also paid a visit to Minna, Niger state capital, to consult Ibrahim Badamasi Babangida (IBB), former military head of state, and “receive his prayers”.
