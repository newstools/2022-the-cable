Lucky Irabor, chief of defence staff (CDS), on Friday, held a meeting with governors of oil-producing states to discuss security challenges affecting their jurisdictions. In recent times, there have been attacks on some communities in oil-producing states. According to Irabor, the meeting was scheduled at the instance of President Muhammadu Buhari, who is concerned over the state of the growing insecurity in the affected states. Oil is the mainstay of the country’s economy. Speaking on the security challenges, the CDS said the country’s economy is “bleeding” and there is a need to reverse the trend. “Given that the issues demand quick action, as mandated by Mr President, we have come to engage with you and the requirement would involve the whole of society,” NAN quoted him as saying. “As critical stakeholders in the Niger Delta, we believe that our framework would address the current issues. You will be playing a critical part. “It is for this reason that we have chosen to engage with you, as directed by Mr President.” On his part, Ifeanyi Okowa, governor of Delta, said if they are able to produce more oil, the country will earn more revenue. “I do think that this collaboration is a very welcome idea and that it will give us the room for even greater collaboration because it requires a stakeholders’ approach to this very challenging issue,” Okowa said. “As for us, the more oil and gas we are able to produce, the better for our states, because to a very large extent, it will improve the revenues that we have from federal allocation. “And beyond that too, we do believe that if we are able to put a stop to what is going on in our environment, it will be a lot cleaner than what it is. “This is because outside the economic challenge, we also do realise that the issues that are currently going on are actually those that affect the health of our people.”
