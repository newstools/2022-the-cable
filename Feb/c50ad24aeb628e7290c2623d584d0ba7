Gunmen suspected to be thugs have attacked the campaign office of Rauf Aregbesola, minister of interior and former governor of Osun. The campaign office is referred to as Oranmiyan House and is located in Osogbo, the Osun capital. TheCable understands that the gunmen invaded the Oranmiyan House on Thursday afternoon, minutes after some party members ended their meeting at the building. It was learnt that the gunmen started shooting sporadically after they invaded the building. The gunmen destroyed some sections of the building, while those present at the premises during the shooting scampered for safety. When Yemisi Opalola, Osun police spokesperson, was contacted for comments, she said the command is yet to get details of the “true picture” of what happened at the Oranmiyan House. Opalola, however, said police officers have been deployed to the area to find out what happened. This is not the first time the campaign office will be attacked by gunmen. In November 2021, the building was attacked by thugs during a meeting of The Osun Progressives (TOP), a group loyal to Aregbesola. In recent times, the political atmosphere in Osun has become heated due to the conflict between loyalists of Gboyega Oyetola, governor of Osun, and Aregbesola’s supporters. On Tuesday, hoodlums attacked the Aregbesola faction of the All Progressives Congress (APC) in Ikirun where they were holding a meeting beside the Ifelodun LGA council secretariat. Meanwhile, on July 16, voters in the state will go to the polls to elect the candidate that will lead Osun for the next four years.
