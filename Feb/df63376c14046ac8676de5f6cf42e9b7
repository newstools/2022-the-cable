Seyi Makinde, Oyo state governor, has approved the appointment of Lekan Balogun as the 42nd Olubadan of Ibadanland. The approval, which was announced on Monday, comes in the wake of a recommendation from the Olubadan-in-Council. Taiwo Adisa, chief press secretary to Makinde, quoted the governor as saying: “I am pleased to announce the appointment of the Otun Olubadan of Ibadanland, High Chief Lekan Balogun as the 42nd Olubadan of Ibadanland.” The governor was also quoted as wishing the newly confirmed Olubadan a “peaceful and eventful reign”. “The appointment is in line with the Olubadan of Ibadan Chieftaincy Declaration, as well as the unique and time-tested tradition of our people,” he added. “On behalf of the government and good people of Oyo State, I wish the newly confirmed Olubadan a successful reign blessed with peace and unprecedented progress.” The governor also approved the revocation of the amended Ibadan Chieftaincy Declaration, which regulates the selection to the Olubadan of Ibadan chieftaincy stool. According to the statement, the governor made the revocation order, dated February 11, 2022, “in line with the powers conferred on him by the Constitution of the Federal Republic of Nigeria, 1999 (as amended), in view of the Judgements of the Oyo State High Court on February 1 and 10 as well as Sections 7, 20,26 and 30 of the Chiefs Law of Oyo State 2000”.
