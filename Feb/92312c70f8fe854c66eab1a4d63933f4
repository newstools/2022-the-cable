Cameroon survived a three-goal deficit to force 3-3 in regulation time before finishing off Burkina Faso 5-3 on penalties to claim the bronze medal in the 2022 African Cup of Nations (AFCON). The hosts recovered from going three goals down to stage a remarkable comeback with 20 minutes left to play, turning despair into celebrations for the host nation’s supporters. Two first-half goals — including an Andre Onana own goal — and a further strike in the second period had seemingly consigned Cameroon to a second defeat at the tournament but Vincent Aboubakar’s brace sealed the comeback before the Indomitable Lions finished off the tie on penalties. Cameroon claim third place at AFCON for only the second time in the tournament’s history, while Burkina Faso could not match their third-place finish at AFCON 2017, finishing fourth for only the second time ever. Issa Kabore, Burkina Faso’s left-back, was central to the team’s two-goal lead at halftime, finding Steeve Yagbo his opposite fullback for the opener on 25 minutes, before providing a cross which was fumbled into the net by Onana, the Cameroonian goalkeeper. Djibril Ouattara added the third goal four minutes into the second half, his powerful header sailing beyond Onana for a commanding lead against the shell-shocked hosts. Cameroon however staged a comeback in the final 20 minutes as Burkina Faso went into self-destruct mode, conceding three soft goals. Stephane Bahoken converted a poorly cleared corner kick in the 71st minute before Vincent Aboubakar, a substitute, scored twice to take his AFCON tally to eight goals. The Cameroon captain’s header from another corner further reduced the deficit on 85 minutes before converting into an empty net two minutes later to complete the turnaround. Onana saved Blati Toure’s spot-kick during the shootout before Oyongo Bitolo won it for the hosts who started and ended their AFCON 2021 tournament with victories over Burkina Faso.
