Umar Farouq, Emir of Daura, says Rotimi Amaechi, minister of transportation, deserves the chieftaincy title bestowed on him by the Daura Emirate Council. Farouq spoke on Saturday during the turbaning ceremony held in Daura, Katsina. TheCable had reported that Amaechi was to be conferred with the title of Ɗan Amanar Daura’ which means ‘The Trustworthy Son Of Daura’. The emirate had said the recognition was for the numerous achievements recorded by the minister in the transport sector in Nigeria Farouq said the emirate does not give traditional titles indiscriminately or for the sake of money. “We thank Almighty Allah, all praises be to Allah for sparing our lives to witness this important occasion where Daura Emirate is giving title to minister of transportation, Rotimi Amaechi,” he said. “I am indeed grateful to the federal government as well as traditional and religious leaders including the Oba of Lagos for supporting the Daura emirate. “On a more serious note, Daura emirate does not give title anyhow but to people who deserve its title like Amaechi.” According to the emirate, Amaechi’s title is also to reciprocate the hand of fellowship extended to Katsina and the north in general through several projects.
