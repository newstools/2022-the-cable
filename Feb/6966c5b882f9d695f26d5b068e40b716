Seun Awogbenle, Nigerian youth advocate and author, says the country is closer to achieving more credible elections. Awogbenle said this on Sunday when he featured on The Morning Show, a programme on ARISE TV. He said the new electoral act would contribute towards making the country’s elections more transparent, as well as inspire voters’ confidence. He described the electronic transmission of election results as the most significant gain in the new electoral act, adding that it will reduce electoral malpractice. “The increasing decline in voters’ participation in the preceding elections is because voters believe that votes do not count and the choices on the ballot do not inspire general confidence,” he said. “With clauses that INEC would now have access to money for the preparation of elections early, to early commencement of primary elections by political parties and the electronic transmission of results, there is an assurance that we are a step towards achieving more credible elections in the country.” Awogbenle asked political parties to conduct credible primary elections to elect quality candidates for the upcoming polls. He also advised youths to join political parties to drive change in society. TheCable had reported that President Muhammadu Buhari signed the revised electoral act on Friday, at a ceremony held at the federal executive council (FEC) chamber in the presidential villa in Abuja.
