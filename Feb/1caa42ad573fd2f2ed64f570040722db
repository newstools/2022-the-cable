Willie Obiano, Anambra governor, says Ebelechukwu, his wife, will be contesting for the Anambra north senatorial district in the 2023 general election. According to NAN, Obiano said this while addressing journalists in Aguleri, Anambra East LGA, after a tour of the Awka International Convention Centre and Anambra cargo and passenger airport on Saturday. He said he would not be contesting for any political office in 2023. In January, Okonkwo Ikechukwu, the national president of the united Ogbunike youths association, had urged the governor’s wife to run for senate. Ikechukwu said the reason for their quest is for the governor’s wife “to continue in the good work she is doing and also attract more development to Anambra north constituency”. “Mrs Obiano empowered many of our youths in Ogbunike. She has placed some in various lofty positions. Youths of Anambra north are beckoning on her to declare interest in the senate race,” Ikechukwu was quoted as saying. Meanwhile, Obiano, who took journalists on an infrastructural tour, said his administration had completed 133 roads across the 181 communities in the state and that international flight would commence in Anambra airport in two weeks. He said the state would be inaugurated on March 9.
