Vice-President Yemi Osinbajo says Nigeria needs to leverage digital technology to maximise access to education and healthcare. In a statement issued on Saturday by Laolu Akande, his spokesman, Osinbajo said this on Friday evening at the United Bank for Africa (UBA) group chairman’s forum for 2022, held in Abuja. According to the vice-president, through digital technology, more people can have proper education and access quality healthcare services. “Beyond all of the successes that we are seeing, we need to educate a large number of people, and train teachers; that’s going to be a major issue in all of this, especially in states where we have a large number of out-of-school children,” he was quoted as saying. “Providing more access to education and healthcare services to a larger number of the population has to be technology-driven to ensure maximum impact. “While Nigeria has experienced significant growth in the use of digital technology and number of tech companies, there is still much room for much improvement, especially on how to effectively use digital technology for mass education and healthcare. “So, we have a robust health system. But the issue is that there are just several millions of people out there in the nook and crannies. And technology must play a role; technology must play an increasing part in our abilities to be able to reach our population everywhere they may be.”
