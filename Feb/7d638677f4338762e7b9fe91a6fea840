The Independent National Electoral Commission says it has identified 186 staff members for immediate redeployment to ensure efficient and optimal performance. According to a statement issued on Thursday by Festus Okoye, chairman, information and voter education committee, INEC, those to be redeployed include head of departments and elections officials. The redeployment exercise will extend to other categories of staff in the commission’s headquarters, state and local government offices nationwide. “The affected staff are either serving in their states of origin or have served for between 10 and 32 years in the same state. The Commission considers this development as unhealthy for the sensitive responsibilities they discharge,” the statement reads. “In line with the Commission’s existing posting policy, henceforth, no Head of Department (HoD) or Electoral Officer (EO) shall serve in his/her state of origin. Furthermore, no staff shall serve for more than two electoral cycles in the same duty post. “Consequently, the Commission has identified 186 staff for immediate redeployment. Among them are 46 HoDs who are either serving in their states of origin or served for more than two electoral cycles in the same state as well as 140 EOs serving in their states of origin or served for more than two electoral cycles in the same state. “The redeployed staff are to complete the handing and taking over not later than Wednesday, 9th March 2022.”
