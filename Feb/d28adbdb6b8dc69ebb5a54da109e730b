A federal high court in Abuja has ordered the federal government to pay N200,000 to four individuals who were previously standing trial with Nnamdi Kanu, leader of the Indigenous People of Biafra (IPOB). Binta Nyako, the presiding judge, ordered the office of the attorney-general of the federation (AGF) to pay N50,000 each to Bright Chimezie, Chidiebere Onwudike, Benjamin Maduagwu and David Nwaurusi for stalling proceedings in the case. The defendants were being tried alongside Kanu for alleged treason, but the IPOB leader’s absence in previous court sittings prompted the federal government to file separate charges against them. They are now facing trial on a three-count charge bordering on treasonable felony. At the court session on Wednesday, there was no legal representation for the federal government at the time the matter was called. The defendants, through their lawyers, complained that they were being subjected to unnecessary hardship of raising funds to attend court from their base outside Abuja. However, shortly before the judge adjourned the matter, one Adewumi Aluko came in and identified herself as a counsel from the AGF’s office. While apologising, she notified the court that Labaran Magaji, the lead prosecutor, was out of the country. She said the prosecution has two witnesses in court but would not want to proceed in Magaji’s absence, and prayed for an adjournment. Nyako frowned at the prosecution’s conduct and counselled it to be more diligent in handling the case. She equally extended similar advice to the defence to stop using frivolous applications to delay proceedings in the case that commenced in 2015. The judge then adjourned till March 17, 2022.
