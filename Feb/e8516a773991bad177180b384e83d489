Trinitas Africa Foundation, a non-governmental organisation (NGO), on Monday, celebrated Valentine’s Day with widows in communities across Lagos. The Valentine’s Day outreach was organised as part of the NGO’s ongoing widows’ empowerment programme to improve the welfare of women who have lost their husbands, by providing them with resources to support their livelihoods. To celebrate the 2022 Valentine’s Day, the foundation surprised the widows with food items, toiletries, flowers, and cakes. Speaking on their experiences, the widows narrated how they have been managing since losing their spouses and highlighted ways in which they would like to receive more support, including education for their children and capital for businesses. Speaking at the outreach, Ade George, chief executive officer (CEO) of Trinitas Foundation, called on individuals and corporate organisations to contribute more towards alleviating the plight of widows. “Losing a spouse is hard but shouldn’t mean a death sentence. Unfortunately, this is the reality for most of these women. We need to do more as a society to support these women and to give them and their children a chance,” he said.
