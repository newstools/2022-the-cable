Security operatives, on Friday, foiled an attack on the divisional police station in Uli, Ihiala LGA of Anambra. According to NAN, the gunmen had earlier attacked the community on Thursday but were repelled by a combined team of police officers and vigilante operatives. A source was quoted as saying the gunmen later regrouped and attacked the police station. Tochukwu Ikenga, Anambra police public relations officer (PPRO), confirmed the attack on the station, but said it was a failed attempt by the gunmen. Ikenga said there was no loss of personnel, adding that one of the operational vehicles, a Lexus 330, which was used by the assailants, was recovered at the scene. “The station is in good condition and no personnel or arms were lost,” the police spokesman said. “Due to the superior fire power of the police operatives, the attackers abandoned one of their operational vehicles, a Lexus 330, black colour, and fled the scene. “Meanwhile, the area has since been fortified by the operatives of the command and operations are ongoing.” He added that Echeng Echeng, the Anambra commissioner of police, commended the officers for their efforts. Ikenga also assured the residents of the command’s readiness to improve security in the state.
