The Nigerian Midstream and Downstream Petroleum Regulatory Authority (NMDPRA) says petrol, with methanol quantities above Nigeria’s specification, was discovered in the supply chain. NMDPRA said this in a statement issued on Tuesday confirming concerns by Nigerians and other stakeholders over the importation of crude above Nigeria’s grade to the market. “Methanol is a regular additive in petrol and is usually blended in an acceptable quantity,” the statement reads. The regulator added that the limited quantity of the impacted product had been isolated and withdrawn from the market, including the loaded trucks in transit to ensure vehicular and equipment safety. The development caused long queues across Lagos and Abuja as many filling stations shut down services. In a now-viral video online, a petrol attendant in Lagos complained how adulterated petrol supplied to the station damaged motorists’ cars and motorcycle engines. “Our technical team, in conjunction with NNPC Ltd and other industry stakeholders, will continue to monitor and ensure quality petroleum products are adequately supplied and distributed nationwide,” the statement adds. “The source supplier has been identified and further commercial and appropriate actions shall be taken by the Authority and NNPC Ltd. “NNPC Ltd and all Oil Marketing Companies have been directed to sustain sufficient distribution of petrol in all retail outlets nationwide. “Meanwhile, NNPC has intensified efforts at increasing the supply of Petrol into the market in order to bridge any unforeseen supply gap.”
