Sunday Dare, minister of youth and sports development, on Sunday, congratulated the national women basketball team D’Tigress for picking a ticket to the 2022 FIBA Women’s World Cup. The Nigerian ladies, who are three-time Afrobasketball champions, beat their Malian opponents 73-69 to qualify as Africa’s sole representatives. They had earlier beaten France, the highly rated world number five, 67-65 after losing their opening game to China. Dare, who commended the ladies for making Nigeria proud with their determination in all the games, tasked them not to rest on their oars until they win the world title. “I have always believed in your abilities to excel in whatever odds and I want to urge you to do us proud again,” he told the players. The 2022 FIBA Women’s Basketball World Cup will take place in Sydney, Australia in September.
