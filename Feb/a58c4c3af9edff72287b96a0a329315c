Harry Kane was the star of the show as Tottenham inflicted a 3-2 defeat on Manchester City at the Etihad Stadium on Saturday. The England striker scored twice, including the winner at the death, to hand City to their first loss in 14 league matches, and a first home defeat in eight games. Dejan Kulusevski gave Tottenham the lead in the fourth minute of the enthralling encounter, slotting home Heung-Min Son’s square pass for 1-0 on his first start for the London club. Man City responded with the equaliser 30 minutes later. Illkay Gundogan, City captain, capitalised on a mistake by Hugo Lloris, Tottenham goalkeeper, to slot the ball into the net despite the presence of two defenders on the line. After Kane regained the lead for Spurs on 59 minutes, Anthony Taylor, the referee, awarded a penalty for handball, and Riyad Mahrez levelled the game with a well-taken kick. Tottenham had the last word as Kane’s header sailed beyond Ederson Moraes for an unlikely winner to end the game with a 3-2 scoreline. Pep Guardiola’s remain on 63 points from 26 matches, with their lead cut to six points by Liverpool who defeated Norwich City 3-1 and have played a game less. Earlier in the day, Emmanuel Dennis, Super Eagles striker, ended his bad patch of form with the only goal in Watford’s 1-0 win at Aston Villa to boost the Hornets’ survival. The 24-year-old’s powerful header from Ismaila Sarr’s cross was enough to hand Watford a first win in 13 league matches. The goal was Dennis’ first in the league since December 2021.
