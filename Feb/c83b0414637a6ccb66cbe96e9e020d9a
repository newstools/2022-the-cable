Mason Greenwood, Manchester United forward, has been released on bail pending further investigation. The English international was arrested on January 30, on the suspicion of sexual assault. This was after Harriet Robson, his girlfriend, accused him of rape and physical abuse. The 20-year-old, who is regarded as one of England’s most talented young footballers, was released from custody on bail on Wednesday pending further inquiries. “A 20-year-old man arrested (on Sunday 30 January 2022) on suspicion of the rape and assault of a woman has been released on bail pending further investigation,” a statement by the Greater Manchester police read. Robson had earlier shared video clips, pictures, and voice notes — which were deleted shortly afterwards — to support her claim of assault by Greenwood. In the audio clip, a man appeared to be threatening to attack her while the images showed her bloodied face and body covered in bruises. “To everyone who wants to know what Mason Greenwood actually does to me,” she captioned the images. The allegations prompted Manchester United to suspend the striker from playing or training until further notice. Greenwood made his senior debut for Manchester United in 2019 and has scored 35 goals in 129 appearances for the club. He made his senior England debut in 2020.
