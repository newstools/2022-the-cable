Solomon Musa, a reporter with Metro Times, has been attacked by hoodlums in Isu Aniocha LGA of Anambra state. The journalist was attacked on February 5 during a trip to the community to deliver a documentary tape. Narrating his ordeal, Musa said the hoodlums emerged from different directions with weapons and started shooting in the air. He said one of them threatened him with a pistol and manhandled him, while another confiscated his media equipment, seized his phone and shattered it on the floor. Musa said his vehicle was also vandalised by the gunmen as he pleaded with them not to kill him. He said the gunmen seized several valuable items from him, including his laptops, international passports, car battery, and bank ATM cards. The reporter, who sustained injuries from the attack, was later rushed to the hospital for treatment. TheCable understands that 48 hours after the incident, a youth leader in the area took Musa to the hideout of the gunmen to plead on his behalf. The youth leader was said to have helped Musa to recover some of his stolen property including his laptops and bank ATM cards. Meanwhile, troops of the Nigerian army, led by Philip Onibon, a captain, were said to have later helped the reporter to recover his car.
