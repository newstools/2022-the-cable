Nigeria’s D’Tigress came from behind to beat France 67-65 in their second game at the FIBA Women’s World Cup qualifiers in Belgrade, Serbia, on Friday. The Otis Hugley-led girls came into the match off a disappointing first game — 90-76 — defeat to China on Thursday, and appeared to allow the struggle from the previous match to follow them into the clash with the French side. The Nigerians suffered early jitters against the team ranked the fifth-best in the world, as they lost the first quarter by 28-11. D’Tigress, however, woke up from the slumber with the realisation that another loss will further complicate their fight for a place in the World Cup. Nigeria kept their hopes of qualifying for #Sydney2022 alive by overcoming a 20-point deficit against France in an all-timer #FIBAWWC x @DtigressNG pic.twitter.com/El9HTspUvx — FIBA Women's Basketball World Cup (@FIBAWWC) February 11, 2022  In the second quarter, they began overrunning the French team, reducing the deficit to 38-27 by halftime. The Nigerians began the third quarter with the same intent, as they breezed past their opponents with relative ease and further reduced the deficit to 52-48. The comeback was completed in the final quarter as the D’Tigress won the game with a two-point margin. Victoria Macaulay led the game for the Nigerians with 19 points as the team led in 2 and 3 pointers 51%-44% and 35%-32%, respectively. The victory means the Nigerian team now has one foot at the World Cup in Australia. Three teams are expected to qualify from the group to the tournament that holds later this year. D’Tigress will play Mali in their final group game on Sunday.
