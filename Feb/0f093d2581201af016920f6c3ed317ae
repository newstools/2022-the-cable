Sunday Dare, minister of youth and sports development, has urged recipients of the 2021 National Youth Service Corps (NYSC) presidential honours not to rest on their oars yet. On Wednesday, the minister hosted the 110 awardees, represented by 10 of their colleagues on a courtesy visit at his Abuja office. During the visit, the ex-corps members honoured the minister with an award over his role in facilitating the presidential recognition. In his remark, Dare said President Muhammadu Buhari deserves credit for sustaining the annual recognition aimed at celebrating outstanding corps members. He also said the initiative is an evidence that there is reward for excellence in public service. “I think the appreciation should first go to President Muhammadu Buhari for keeping the Awards alive and also expanding the opportunities they confer. There is reward for excellence in public service,” he said. “It may not be in financial terms or material gains but in recognition, commendation, satisfaction and the experience gained that would help you in other areas of your lives.” The minister also enjoined the awardees to make optimal use of the opportunity given to them and contribute positively to the socio-economic development of the country. “Continue to break new grounds and develop innovative ideas that will positively impact the places where you work,” he added. On their part, the awardees promised to continue to serve with distinction and partner the government using their positive energy and enthusiasm for national growth and development.
