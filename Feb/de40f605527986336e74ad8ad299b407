Malam Dauda, director of operations, Kaduna Geographic Information Service (KADGIS), has been killed by gunmen. The gunmen, said to be about five in number, invaded Dauda’s residence at Barakallahu, Igabi LGA of the state in the early hours of Friday. The gunmen reportedly killed the victim and left his residence without taking any items. Muhammad Abdullahi, district head of Barkallahu community, confirmed the incident. Abdullahi said the divisional police officers (DPOs) of Rigachikun and Barnawa have visited the crime scene for an on-the-spot assessment of the incident. “This is a case of assassination as the gunmen only went to the victim’s house, killed him, and left the community without taking anything neither did they attack the guard,” Abdullahi said. He added that a neighbouring community was also attacked by the gunmen but there was no casualty. “We feel they just attacked the community to make it look like an attack,” he said. “We have been facing various security breaches in the community informed by the vast ungoverned land taken over by the Nigerian air force (NAF).
