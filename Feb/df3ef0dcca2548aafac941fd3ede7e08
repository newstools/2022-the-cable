The All Progressives Congress (APC) says Babajide Sanwo-Olu, governor of the state, does not need the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) to get re-elected for a second term in office in 2023. The APC said this in reaction to comments credited to Ganiu Taofik, a PDP chieftain in Lagos state. Taofik had said the party is ready to receive the governor if he wants to get re-elected. In a statement on Friday, Seye Oladejo, Lagos APC spokesman, described PDP’s gubernatorial ticket as “worthless”. Oladejo said the PDP should desist from its attempts to destabilise the ruling party through the “deliberate promotion of falsehood”. “While the thought of desperately offering its worthless electoral tickets to every passerby is laughable, the extent of the level of degradation, degeneration and comatose state of Lagos state PDP should not be lost on all and sundry,” he said. “The platform that initially elected Governor Babajide Olusola Sanwoolu, having acknowledged his glowing performance across various sectors in his first term, is certainly still available to recontest for another term. “While we sympathize with Lagos state PDP over its several years of political misfortunes and misadventures, good wisdom dictates that it puts its house in order to have a semblance of relevance. “It’s pitiable that PDP could only think of fishing in the pool of capable talents in the APC while looking for people to offer its worthless electoral tickets. “This underscores the lack of attraction in the PDP and an admittance of its usual waterloo in the forthcoming elections. “Governor Babajide Sanwo-Olu hereby unequivocally rejects this Greek gift and hereby states that APC remains his party of choice in making his next political move, which will be made known in due course to all Lagosians.”
