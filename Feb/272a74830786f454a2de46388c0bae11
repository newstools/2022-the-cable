The All Progressives Congress (APC) has officially informed the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) of its decision to hold a national convention on February 26. In a letter dated February 2 and addressed to Mahmood Yakubu, INEC chairman, Mai Mala Buni, chairman of the Caretaker Extraordinary Convention Planning Committee (CECPC), and John Akpanudoedehe, national secretary, asked the electoral commission to deploy for its officials to monitor the exercise. The party said it is notifying the commission in line with section 85 of the electoral act which provides that political parties should give INEC at least a 21-day notice before conducting the exercise. “Follow up to our letter referenced APC/NHDQ/INEC/19/021/40 dated 11th July, 2021 on the notice for the conduct of national convention,” a copy of the letter seen by TheCable read. “This is to inform the commission that our great party has scheduled to hold its national convention on Saturday, 26th February, 2022. “This serves as a formal notification pursuant to the provisions of section 85 of the electoral act (2010) as amended. Kindly arrange for your officials to monitor the exercise accordingly.” The letter did not state where the convention will be held. However, the exercise would likely be held at the Eagle Square in Abuja.
