Kunle Olajide, secretary-general of Yoruba Council of Elders, has asked Abubakar Malami, attorney-general of the federation, to state the offences of Sunday Adeyemo, the Yoruba nation agitator better known as Sunday Igboho. He said this will enable Nigerians to understand why the federal government is demanding that Igboho stands trial in the country. On Tuesday, Malami said the federal government may prosecute the separatist activist after he is released by Benin Republic authorities. Reacting to Malami’s statement, Olajide told TheCable that it will be a “double trial” if the government goes ahead to prosecute Igboho after his ordeal abroad. Olajide said considering the invasion of Igboho’s home by federal security operatives, where some people living in the house were killed, he fled Nigeria because his life was in danger. He said: “That is double trial, nobody does that because it is double jeopardy. Which law did Igboho break? Malami should have given details so that those who are not in the law profession can understand clearly. “That statement lacks enough details especially with regards to the fact that Igboho’s house was vandalised with people killed in the dead of the night. “The first reaction to that invasion by anybody is to protect your life. There is clear evidence that Igboho’s life is being hunted. So which law has Igboho broken after his house was invaded? Malami should state it clearly to Nigerians.” While agreeing that a political solution is possible, Olajide however said that Malami’s idea of a solution may be different from what President Muhammadu Buhari has in mind. “On the political solution he mentioned, it all depends on the president,” he said. “The president might see it differently from his opinion. What he said on political solution is personal to him. But yes, there can be a political solution.”
