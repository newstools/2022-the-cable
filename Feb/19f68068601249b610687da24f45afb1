Pelumi Olajengbesi, a lawyer, says Sunday Adeyemo, the Yoruba nation agitator better known as Sunday Igboho, will soon regain his freedom. Olajengbesi had in January announced his resignation from the legal team of Igboho. Igboho has been in detention in Benin Republic since he was arrested at an airport in Cotonou by the country’s security forces while he was trying to flee to Germany in July 2020. He fled Nigeria for Benin Republic after the Nigerian government declared him wanted. A Beninise court blocked the extradition of Igboho to Nigeria while ruling that the activist be remanded in prison pending further hearing. Writing on his Facebook page on Saturday, Olajengbesi described Igboho as a courageous man, claiming that he has it on good authority that the Yoruba nation agitator will soon be freed. He wrote: “Chief Sunday Igboho will be out very soon and there will be massive jubilation across the entire Yoruba land. “He is no doubt a courageous man. This is very authoritative, just that our Yoruba leaders should stop being selfish and allow good to prevail.”
