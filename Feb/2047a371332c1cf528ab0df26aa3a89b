Mohammed Bello, minister of the federal capital territory (FCT), says the COVID-19 deaths recorded in Abuja in the last few weeks were from unvaccinated persons. Bello, who has received his COVID booster shot, shared a message with residents of the FCT on Sunday. The minister encouraged residents to get fully vaccinated and urged eligible persons to take the booster shot. “I tell you, from the figures I get from our public health department, 100 percent of the deaths that we experienced in the FCT during the last few weeks as a result of COVID-19 were from those who were not vaccinated,” he said. “So, the thing is that for those that are vaccinated, chances are that their cases will be mild, like my own case. “My message to us is let us all get vaccinated. For those who have been vaccinated for the first and second dose, I advise them to go for the booster.” The minister, who recently contracted the virus, said it was the vaccination that saved his life. “I thank God Almighty that I took the first and second doses of the COVID vaccine, because on December 31, 2021, I was tested positive for COVID-19 and even though I was told it was mild, I know what I experienced,” he said. “Although I was not hospitalised, I was quarantined in my residence for three weeks. This is because subsequently, even after taking the medication, I tested positive twice. It was the third time that I got a negative result. “If I had not taken the first and second doses, probably what has happened to many of my dear ones would have happened to me. I will take all the recommended shots because I don’t want to go through what I went through again.”
