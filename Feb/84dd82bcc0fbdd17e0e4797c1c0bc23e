A section of the Asokoro District Hospital in the federal capital territory (FCT) has been gutted by fire. The fire is said to have started on Thursday afternoon. Speaking with TheCable, one of the firefighters who identified himself as Arome, said the cause of the fire is yet to be ascertained, adding that there were no casualties. “We’re yet to know the cause of the fire. We have a particular department for that so when we come back from extinguishing a fire, we’ll report to them where we went to so they can go there and investigate the cause of the fire,” he said. “There were no casualties and nobody was injured. There was nobody in the building affected. The fire was not that big. It took us about 30 to 40 minutes to extinguish the fire.” There have been a few fire incidents in Abuja in recent times.
