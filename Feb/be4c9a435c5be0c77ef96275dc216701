Yekini Nabena, a chieftain of the All Progressives Congress (APC), says leaders of the party should trust Mai Mala Buni, chairman of the national caretaker committee. In a statement issued on Monday, Nabena said some leaders of the party are sponsoring a “campaign of calumny” in the media against Buni and his committee over the party’s convention scheduled for February 26. The politician advised the unnamed leaders against putting the party in bad light, adding that “there is no specific time the party must hold the said national convention”. He said the APC under Mai Mala Buni “cannot be stampeded” to take any action that will serve the interest of some persons but will “eventually work against the chances of the party in near future”. “I appeal to our leaders at all levels to trust the CECPC leadership and eschew every form of action that will portray APC in bad light,” he said. “Those sponsoring fifth columnists against the APC chairman and the party leadership are like political vultures who feed on dead meat but presently there is no dead meat for them to eat. “The party leadership knows them and at the appropriate time, actions will be taken against them according to the APC constitution.” Although the convention is scheduled for February 26, sub-committees that should be in place have not been set up or inaugurated.
