Nnamdi Kanu, leader of the Indigenous People of Biafra (IPOB), has asked the International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC) to intervene so he can have access to an independent medical examination. The IPOB leader spoke through his lawyer, Aloy Ejimakor, in a letter addressed to Yann Bonzon, ICRC head of delegation in Nigeria. Kanu alleged that he has been subjected to a series of torture that has taken a toll on his health. He asked the ICRC to implore the federal government to allow him to seek medical treatment. “His said serious health problems require the urgent and constant attention of specialist doctors and medications that are not being given to him in the detention facility,” Ejimakor said. “In this circumstance, he is daily facing the grim and imminent risk of losing his life in detention and the risk increases each passing day. “In view of the foregoing, we mostly respectfully request that you bring your good offices to bear on the government of Nigeria to grant our client the opportunity of an independent medical examination and care within the shortest possible time henceforth. “We trust that you will determine our humble request to be consistent with ICRC’s policy of promoting international humanitarian law in Nigeria and securing humane treatment and conditions of detention for all detainees, regardless of the reasons for their arrest and detention. “While thanking you for the opportunity of submitting this urgent appeal and your expeditious consideration of it, please be assured of our highest esteems for you and your good offices.” Kanu is standing trial on an amended 15-count charge bordering on treasonable felony.
