Former President Olusegun Obasanjo says Nigeria needs “more rebels” who can speak uncomfortable truths. The former president spoke on Saturday in Abeokuta, Ogun state, while unveiling the autobiography of Tayo Sowunmi, titled ‘Footprints of a Rebel’. Obasanjo commended Sowunmi for living “an exemplary life” worthy of emulation by the younger generation. “Looking at the title of the book, I ask myself, why would someone call himself a rebel, but it is good. The truth is that if you have to live a life of honesty and integrity, you have to become a rebel,” he said. “There would be some time you would be asked to do something, but you would say no, this is not right. And when you say that you will become a rebel. You may even become a persona non grata. “Our country —Nigeria — needs more of rebels. Those who will look at things straight in the face and say this is not right. This is spot on. This, I will not be part of. This is not good for Nigeria.” In his speech, Tunde Bakare, the serving overseer of the Citadel Global Community Church, said “dysfunctional homes produce dysfunctional nation,” adding that drug traffickers, corrupt politicians and kidnappers are products of families. Bakare added that a value-driven society can only be achieved when parents transfer values to their families. The cleric said Nigeria must revive the aspects of the African culture that foster community spirit and nation-building.
