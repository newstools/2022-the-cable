Enough is Enough! (EiE), a civil society organisation, has launched a campaign tagged #MakeNaijaWork to encourage Nigerians to register to vote. The organisation said the campaign kicked off on February 2 under its ‘register, select, vote-not-fight, protect’ (#RSVP) flagship initiative, with a series of media engagements, including a Twitter spaces conversation. It said the 13-month campaign is a clarion call to Nigerians to seize the opportunity to elect credible leaders and choose candidates based on courage, compassion, competence, capacity, and character. “Launched in the month of love, #MakeNaijaWork asks that we show love to our country by engaging in the process to make her work for the benefit of all. If we love Nigeria, we should do all that we can to make her work, which includes registering to vote, voting wisely and holding our public servants accountable,” the organisation said in a statement issued on Tuesday. Speaking on the core objective of the campaign, ‘Yemi Adamolekun, EiE executive director, said citizens are yet to make socio-political progress because “we are yet to strategically occupy our office of the citizen”. “We are yet to understand that this is the highest office in Nigeria because elected and appointed public servants serve us. They are called public servants for a reason – to serve the public! Elections provide an opportunity to determine our servants,” Adamolekun added.
