The case file of Olisa Metuh, a former national publicity secretary of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP), has been reassigned to a new judge of an Abuja federal high court. The Economic and Financial Crimes Commission (EFCC) had, in 2016, arraigned Metuh on seven counts of money laundering bordering on him allegedly receiving N400 million from the office of the national security adviser. Okon Abang, a federal high court judge, had on February 25, 2020, pronounced Metuh guilty on all counts of money laundering and sentenced him to seven years in prison. Dissatisfied with the court’s decision, Metuh, through his counsel, filed an appeal in March 2020. As part of the 10 issues raised for determination by the appellate court, Metuh argued that he was not given a fair trial. He submitted that the trial judge was biased, citing some of the remarks made during the trial. Delivering judgment on December 16, 2020, a three-member panel of justices agreed that the trial judge showed bias against the appellant. Consequently, he was released from prison on December 24, 2020. The new case was scheduled to come up on October 14, 2021, before Obiora Egwatu, a judge. However, due to the absence of the judge, it was adjourned till February 15, 2022. But on Tuesday, the case was not listed on the cause list before Egwatu. According to NAN, the case has been reassigned to Emeka Nwite, a new judge who was recently transferred to the Abuja division after the retirement of Anwuli Chikere. No date has been fixed for the trial to commence.
