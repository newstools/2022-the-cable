The United States attorney’s office at the central district of California has postponed the sentencing of Ramon Abbas, the self-confessed fraudster better known as Hushpuppi. The court had initially scheduled the sentencing for February 14 — but it has now been moved to July 11. According to PUNCH, Thom Mrozek, the court’s director of media relations, confirmed the new date. “The sentencing hearing that was scheduled for later this month has been delayed,” Mrozek said. Otis Wright, a judge in Los Angeles, was said to have granted the order for postponement after Hushpuppi’s lawyers led by Louis Shapiro applied for a deferment. Hushpuppi, who is known for his luxury life, was arrested in the UAE back in June 2020 alongside 11 of his associates over allegations bordering on hacking, impersonation, scamming, banking fraud, and identity theft. He was extradited to the US after the UAE police had detailed his arrest in a special operation dubbed ‘Fox Hunt 2’, where he was accused of defrauding 1.9 million victims to the tune of N168 billion. The socialite would later plead guilty to money laundering, putting him at the risk of 20 years imprisonment. Hushpuppi was also in the news in July 2021 after he claimed to have bribed Abba Kyari, the deputy commissioner of police (DCP), to arrest Chibuzo, his co-fraudster and rival. Although Kyari dismissed the allegations, an investigation by the FBI claimed the detective collaborated with Hushpuppi to facilitate the arrest of Chibuzo.
