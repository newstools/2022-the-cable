The National Association of Nigeria Students (NANS) has threatened to block all federal roads and protest at two federal ministries. Sunday Asefon, NANS president, said the protest will take place if the industrial action by the Academic Staff Union of Universities (ASUU) is not resolved by the weekend. He spoke on Wednesday on Sunrise Daily, a Channels Television programme. “If we do not see a concrete decision between the federal government and ASUU or if they fail to address this issue by Saturday or Sunday, or if there is no press statement from ASUU telling students to go back to school, then our ultimatum stands,” the NANS president said. “We would have no choice but to tell Nigeria students to block all federal roads and the office of the minister of education and office of the minister of labour should also be blocked. “We are resolute and it’s high time the government takes our lives and education in this country seriously. The Nigerian government should do something to stop bastardising our educational sector. “Students are angry and disappointed at this moment that after the 2020 ASUU strike that lasted for nine months, a lot has been lost.” Asefon said the strike is a necessity because it is for the benefit of the students, adding that the government needs to be honest in its decisions. “If we look at it, 30 percent to 40 percent of ASUU’s agitation is for the benefit of the Nigerian students,” he added. “We are calling on the government to go into action and implement the agreement so all these industrial actions can be put aside. “All of these actions affect the students because even if the ASUU goes on strike for two years, their salaries will still be paid as well as the ministers, nothing will happen to them.”
