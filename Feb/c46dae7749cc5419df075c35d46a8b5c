Abdullahi Gaya, chairman, house of representatives committee on petroleum (downstream), says the companies responsible for importing methanol-blended premium motor spirit (PMS) will be dealt with. The committee chairman spoke on Wednesday during a meeting with the Nigerian National Petroleum Company (NNPC) on the current fuel situation in the country. Garba Muhammad, group general manager, Nigerian National Petroleum Company(NNPC), released a statement to this effect. TheCable had reported that methanol-blended PMS was imported from Antwerp, Belgium, by four direct sales direct purchase (DSDP) suppliers, namely MRS, Oando, Emadeb Consortium, and Duke Oil, a subsidiary of NNPC. While addressing the committee, Mele Kyari, NNPC general managing director, said: “We are a law-abiding company. There is no way we could have known about the methanol presence. “The only way we could have known about it is if our suppliers, in good faith, made the disclosure to us. “In this particular instance, the discovery was made by our inspection agents who noticed the emulsification at the filling stations and brought it to our attention. “Subsequent investigation revealed that the four cargoes which are all from the same source also contained methanol-blended PMS.” Kyari added that NNPC is working hard to reduce queues across the country. He expressed sympathy with Nigerians on the current situation and assured them that adequate measures have been put in place to maintain supply sufficiency and prevent future occurrences.
