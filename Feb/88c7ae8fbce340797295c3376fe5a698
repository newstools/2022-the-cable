Emmanuel Bwacha, deputy minority leader of the senate, has defected to the All Progressives Congress (APC) from the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP). President Muhammadu Buhari received Bwacha, senator representing Taraba south, at the Aso Rock villa on Thursday. Bwacha was accompanied to the villa by Mai Mala Buni, chairman of the APC caretaker extraordinary convention planning committee (CECPC). Ibrahim Gambari, chief of staff to the president, was also present when Buhari received the senator into the APC fold. Bwacha joins the list of high profile persons who have defected to the party in recent months. In November 2020, David Umahi, governor of Ebonyi, defected to the APC from the PDP. Umahi had said he defected to the APC because of the alleged injustice done to the south-east by PDP. “I offered this movement as a protest to the injustice being done to the south-east by the PDP since 1998 till date,” the governor had said. In June 2021, Bello Matawalle, governor of Zamfara, defected to the APC from the PDP, adding that he took the decision because he wanted to bring peace to his state. “I believe we will get more troops to come and flush out the criminals. I assure you that you’ll see a lot of changes, because we will get more improvement on each facility that we have,” he had said.
