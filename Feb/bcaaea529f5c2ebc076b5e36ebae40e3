President Muhammadu Buhari says Kayode Fayemi, governor of Ekiti, has done well to bring sustainable development to Ekiti state. Buhari said this on Wednesday in a message to congratulate the Ekiti governor on his 57th birthday. Fayemi, who is also chairman of the Nigeria Governors’ Forum (NGF), clocked 57 on Wednesday. According to a statement issued by Garba Shehu, presidential spokesman, Buhari described the Ekiti governor as “a good friend and an active party member”. “Ekiti is lucky to have a leader like Governor Fayemi. In his last and final year as second term governor, he has brought the State back to its glory, culture and values,” Buhari was quoted as saying. The president also wished the Ekiti governor “more years in the service of his community and the nation”. In a similar development, the president congratulated Kemi Nelson, woman leader of the All Progressives Congress (APC) in the south-west zone, who clocked 66 on Wednesday. According to Buhari, the efforts of women in politics like Kemi Nelson deserve commendation. “Nigeria takes pride in the many accomplishments of the women of our nation. It is our party’s honour to have leaders such as Kemi Nelson in our midst,” he said.
