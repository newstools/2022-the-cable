The UK Health Security Agency (UKHSA) says three cases of Lassa fever have been recorded in the country. Lassa fever is an acute viral haemorrhagic illness caused by the Lassa virus. People usually become infected with the Lassa virus through exposure to food or household items contaminated with urine or faeces of infected rodents – present in a number of West African countries where the disease is endemic. The virus can also be spread through infected bodily fluids. Most people with Lassa fever will make a full recovery, however severe illness can occur in some individuals. In a statement earlier this week, the agency had announced that two people had been diagnosed with the disease in the country. It had said a probable case of Lassa fever was under investigation. The agency also added that the cases were within the same family and are “linked to recent travel to West Africa”. “One of the cases has recovered, while the other will receive specialist care at the Royal Free London NHS Foundation Trust,” the statement reads. “The probable case is receiving care at Bedfordshire Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust. The High Consequence Infectious Disease Network is engaged with their ongoing care.” But in a statement on Friday, the UKHSA said the probable case of Lassa fever under investigation is now confirmed and that the individual has died. “We are contacting the individuals who have had close contact with the cases prior to confirmation of their infection, to provide appropriate assessment, support and advice. The risk to the general public remains very low,” the statement reads. According to the agency, prior to these cases, there have been eight cases of Lassa fever imported to the UK since 1980 — with the last two cases in 2009. In Nigeria, there have been 211 cases of Lassa fever and 40 deaths in 2022 — according to the Nigeria Centre for Disease Control (NCDC).
