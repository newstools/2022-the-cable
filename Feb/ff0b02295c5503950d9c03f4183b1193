The investment bank grew into a giant in the industry. By 2003, he listed the same on the Nigerian Stock Exchange. In 2004, IBTC merged with Chartered Bank in what became IBTC Chartered Bank, following a recapitalisation of Nigerian banks under Charles Soludo, governor of CBN at the time. He was CEO from 1989 to 2007. And in his usual style, he sent a mail to all members of staff announcing his resignation as the leader of the executive team, after a successful merger and acquisition process with Standard Bank of South Africa. Peterside still holds the position of non-executive director on the boards of Standard Bank Group Ltd and The Standard Bank Of South Africa Ltd.
