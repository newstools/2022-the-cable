The All Progressives Congress (APC) has fixed March 26 for its national convention. The development comes weeks after the party announced that the national convention would hold on February 26. Speaking on Monday at a media briefing in Abuja, John Akpanudoedehe, national secretary of the APC caretaker committee, said zonal congresses would now be held on March 12. The zonal congresses would be held alongside preparations for the party’s convention. “After deliberations and agreement with the national caretaker committee, we have agreed and approved that the activities of the national convention commence from the 24th of February and terminate on the 26th of March,” Akpanudoedehe said. “The convention activities will commence on February 24 and terminate at Eagle Square on 26th of March. In between the convention, we have agreed to have zonal congresses.” The development comes days after Hope Uzodimma, governor of Imo, had said although there were no plans by the APC to postpone the convention, the date wasn’t sacrosanct. “That is the decision of the party and there is nothing wrong even if it doesn’t hold. What is important is that we must have our convention,” he had said. “We have said it’s 26th. If for any reason tomorrow, it’s not doable in the opinion of the party, we will move. But that does not mean that there is any intention to move.”
