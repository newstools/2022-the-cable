Seyi Makinde, the Oyo governor, says the new Olubadan of Ibadanland will be announced on Monday. Makinde said this on Saturday during the final burial rites for Saliu Adetunji, the Olubadan of Ibadanland, who died on January 2, 2022. At the event, which was held at the Obafemi Awolowo stadium in Ibadan, Makinde said the emergence of a new Olubadan is in line with tradition. “I must sincerely thank God for a day like this because what we really hoped for is exactly what is happening here today. The last respect we are paying for our late father today shows that Baba lived a good life,” he said. “When the crisis of the obaship in Ibadanland started, I was right here at the Liberty stadium (Obafemi Awolowo stadium) and said that if there is any division or faction in the land, I will pitch my tent with the king. “Today, I am also happy that the crisis we have been witnessing on the issue of the Olubadan stool has been settled. God has really taken control of everything. “I have received a letter from the olubadan-in-council and by the grace of God, on Monday, I will make the official announcement of the new Olubadan of Ibadanland. “This is another victory for Ibadan traditional institution. The process and the system were never broken. So, there is nothing to fix.” Present at the ceremony were traditional rulers, members of the Central Council of Ibadan Indigenes (CCII), religious leaders, and political office holders.
