Some delegates to the national convention of the All Progressives Congress (APC) have thrown their weight behind Saliu Mustapha, former deputy national chairman of the defunct Congress for Progressive Change (CPC), for the party’s chairmanship position. In a statement on Tuesday, Dapo Okubanjo, media aide to Mustapha, said the delegates, serving and former house of assembly members, pledged their support when they visited the aspirant at his campaign headquarters in Abuja. Speaking on behalf of the delegation, Umar Yapak, lawmaker representing Verre constituency in Adamawa, said they decided to back the aspirant because he is a “unifier”. “We have heard about how, as deputy national chairman of the defunct Congress for Progressive Change (CPC), you were fair to all in terms of choice of party candidates,” Yapak said. “We also know that you will use your experience in party administration and your age to act as a bridge between the older generation of APC members and the younger ones amongst us. “But we are asking that you ensure that the party has a better reward system in order to calm the nerves of aggrieved party members. “We would also be looking at speaking to some of our colleagues in the neighbouring states of Gombe and Taraba who we collaborate with on several issues of mutual interest.” On his part, Mustapha said if elected chairman of the APC, there would be regular consultation on issues about the party. “I won’t take this gesture, from you distinguished personalities, for granted especially as you counted me worthy for endorsement among the strong list of contenders for the position,” the aspirant said. “Let me assure you that on my watch, the party leadership will ensure that consultations are done on a regular basis with stakeholders across board. “This will go a long way to manage any possible crisis even before it becomes a major problem. “As for Adamawa we all know it is an APC state and we will ensure that we get it back in 2023.”
