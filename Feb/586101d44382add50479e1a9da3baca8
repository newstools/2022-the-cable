A federal high court in Abuja has fixed April 8 to rule on an application seeking to quash the charges against Nnamdi Kanu, leader of the Indigenous People of Biafra (IPOB). Kanu is standing trial on an amended 15-count charge bordering on treasonable felony. At the resumed court session on Wednesday, Mike Ozekhome, Kanu’s lead counsel, describe the charges as “defective and baseless”. He said his application seeks the “quashing, striking out and dismissing of the 15-count amended charge” for being “incompetent and denying the court of jurisdiction to entertain the suit”. The application, premised on 34 grounds and supported by a 36-paragraph affidavit, is also seeking an order acquitting and discharging Kanu. “You are accusing Kanu of making some broadcast. You didn’t say where these broadcasts were made. Were they made in the spirit world, made in the air or under the ground?” Ozekhome asked. He also said according to the provisions of the federal high court act, a prosecutor is expected to give exact details of a location where an offence is committed. Ozekhome adopted his application and asked the court to strike out the entire charge. However, Shuaibu Labaran, the prosecution counsel, asked the court to dismiss the defendant’s application. Binta Nyako, the presiding judge, thereafter, fixed April 8 to deliver ruling on the application.
