Bola Tinubu, a chieftain of the All Progressives Congress, has commiserated with the family of Hassan Danbaba, the Magajin Garin Sokoto (head of the kingmakers of Sokoto Caliphate), over the death of the traditional ruler. The Magajin Garin Sokoto died on Saturday. Speaking on Monday when he visited Sa’ad Abubakar, the Sultan of Sokoto, and the family of the Magajin Garin Sokoto, Tinubu expressed condolences to them over the death of the traditional ruler. The APC leader was received in Sokoto by Aliyu Wamakko, former governor of the state, who led Tinubu’s delegation to the family house of the late traditional ruler, where prayers were offered for the repose of his soul. The late Magajin Garin was the grandson of Ahmadu Bello, the late premier of the northern region. “We can’t question Allah. He gives and takes. We pray that Almighty Allah recognises the many good deeds of the Magajin Garin for Sokoto Caliphate, Nigeria and humanity and grant him Aljanna Firdaus,” the APC chieftain said. At the sultan’s palace, Tinubu presented a condolence letter and spoke about his personal relationship with the late Magajin Garin, as well as his contributions to the Caliphate and the country. “Losing Magajin Garin at such a tender age can be painful indeed. It is even more hurtful that this passing came barely a year after we lost his mother, Hajiya A’ishatu, the eldest daughter of the late premier of northern Nigeria, sir Ahmadu Bello,” he said. “I understand your pain and I share in it. Magajin Garin was a fine gentleman and a devout Muslim who related well with all those who encountered him. “He contributed immensely to the development of not only the Sokoto Caliphate but also in the entire country. He also played a leading role in the propagation of Islam in Nigeria and beyond. “Your highness, I would also like, through you, to extend by commiseration to governor Aminu Waziri Tambuwal, the immediate family of the deceased and indeed to the entire Saudana Family. “My prayer is that Allah Subuhanan Watahala comforts his family and all those he left behind. May He also grant his soul Aljanna Firdaus. Amin.” Below are photos. <img class="alignnone wp-image-663285" src="https://f5p3e9e4.stackpathcdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/PHOTO-2022-02-14-19-11-43.jpg" alt="" width="550" height="367" srcset="https://f5p3e9e4.stackpathcdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/PHOTO-2022-02-14-19-11-43.jpg 1086w, https://f5p3e9e4.stackpathcdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/PHOTO-2022-02-14-19-11-43-300x200.jpg 300w, https://f5p3e9e4.stackpathcdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/PHOTO-2022-02-14-19-11-43-1024x683.jpg 1024w, https://f5p3e9e4.stackpathcdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/PHOTO-2022-02-14-19-11-43-768x512.jpg 768w, https://f5p3e9e4.stackpathcdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/PHOTO-2022-02-14-19-11-43-24x16.jpg 24w, https://f5p3e9e4.stackpathcdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/PHOTO-2022-02-14-19-11-43-36x24.jpg 36w, https://f5p3e9e4.stackpathcdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/PHOTO-2022-02-14-19-11-43-48x32.jpg 48w" sizes="(max-width: 550px) 100vw, 550px" /> <img class="alignnone wp-image-663284" src="https://f5p3e9e4.stackpathcdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/PHOTO-2022-02-14-19-12-05.jpg" alt="" width="550" height="367" srcset="https://f5p3e9e4.stackpathcdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/PHOTO-2022-02-14-19-12-05.jpg 1086w, https://f5p3e9e4.stackpathcdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/PHOTO-2022-02-14-19-12-05-300x200.jpg 300w, https://f5p3e9e4.stackpathcdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/PHOTO-2022-02-14-19-12-05-1024x683.jpg 1024w, https://f5p3e9e4.stackpathcdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/PHOTO-2022-02-14-19-12-05-768x512.jpg 768w, https://f5p3e9e4.stackpathcdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/PHOTO-2022-02-14-19-12-05-24x16.jpg 24w, https://f5p3e9e4.stackpathcdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/PHOTO-2022-02-14-19-12-05-36x24.jpg 36w, https://f5p3e9e4.stackpathcdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/PHOTO-2022-02-14-19-12-05-48x32.jpg 48w" sizes="(max-width: 550px) 100vw, 550px" /> <img class="alignnone wp-image-663286" src="https://f5p3e9e4.stackpathcdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/PHOTO-2022-02-14-19-11-38.jpg" alt="" width="550" height="367" srcset="https://f5p3e9e4.stackpathcdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/PHOTO-2022-02-14-19-11-38.jpg 1086w, https://f5p3e9e4.stackpathcdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/PHOTO-2022-02-14-19-11-38-300x200.jpg 300w, https://f5p3e9e4.stackpathcdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/PHOTO-2022-02-14-19-11-38-1024x683.jpg 1024w, https://f5p3e9e4.stackpathcdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/PHOTO-2022-02-14-19-11-38-768x512.jpg 768w, https://f5p3e9e4.stackpathcdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/PHOTO-2022-02-14-19-11-38-24x16.jpg 24w, https://f5p3e9e4.stackpathcdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/PHOTO-2022-02-14-19-11-38-36x24.jpg 36w, https://f5p3e9e4.stackpathcdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/PHOTO-2022-02-14-19-11-38-48x32.jpg 48w" sizes="(max-width: 550px) 100vw, 550px" /> <img class="alignnone wp-image-663287" src="https://f5p3e9e4.stackpathcdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/PHOTO-2022-02-14-19-06-56.jpg" alt="" width="550" height="367" srcset="https://f5p3e9e4.stackpathcdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/PHOTO-2022-02-14-19-06-56.jpg 1086w, https://f5p3e9e4.stackpathcdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/PHOTO-2022-02-14-19-06-56-300x200.jpg 300w, https://f5p3e9e4.stackpathcdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/PHOTO-2022-02-14-19-06-56-1024x683.jpg 1024w, https://f5p3e9e4.stackpathcdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/PHOTO-2022-02-14-19-06-56-768x512.jpg 768w, https://f5p3e9e4.stackpathcdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/PHOTO-2022-02-14-19-06-56-24x16.jpg 24w, https://f5p3e9e4.stackpathcdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/PHOTO-2022-02-14-19-06-56-36x24.jpg 36w, https://f5p3e9e4.stackpathcdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/PHOTO-2022-02-14-19-06-56-48x32.jpg 48w" sizes="(max-width: 550px) 100vw, 550px" />
