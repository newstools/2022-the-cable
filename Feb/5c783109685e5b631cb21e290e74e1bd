Members of the resident doctors association at the University of Medical Sciences Teaching Hospital (UNIMEDTH), Ondo state, have suspended their two-day warning strike. According to NAN, the decision to suspend the strike was contained in a statement issued on Thursday by John Matthew, president of the association. The resident doctors had, on Wednesday, embarked on a warning strike after a doctor was allegedly assaulted by the relative of a patient. According to the statement, the strike was suspended after the intervention of Francis Faduyile, the special adviser to the governor on health. “This is to inform you that the two-day warning strike embarked upon by members of our association yesterday, February 9, has been suspended and our members are back to work at 8am today,” the statement reads. “This decision is borne out of the assurances of the special adviser to the governor on health to, among other things, address the immediate and remote cause of the barbaric act of assault against doctors and other healthcare workers in our institution. “The congress, while appreciating efforts of the management at apprehending and prosecuting the accused person, demands that all measures must be put in place to protect healthcare workers in the course of their duties and also see to it that other issues raised are promptly treated in the interest of all.” The association also assured the hospital management of their continued support and commitment to the peace and growth of the institution.
