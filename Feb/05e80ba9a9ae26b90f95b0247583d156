Nathaniel Ikyur, chief press secretary to Samuel Ortom, governor of Benue, says his principal does not hate President Muhammadu Buhari. Speaking on Friday at a media briefing held in Abuja, Ikyur said Ortom wants to help Buhari leave a good legacy. Ortom has been quite critical of Buhari’s style of governance, especially on security challenges affecting communities across the country, and especially his state. Speaking on the Benue governor’s comments, the chief press secretary said Ortom is not expected to keep quiet over attacks on communities in Benue. “I want to reiterate the fact that my principal, governor Samuel Ortom, doesn’t hate President Buhari. His comments on the state of the nation and the leadership style of the president do not mean he hates him,” he said. “No sane person will keep mum while his people are being killed on a daily basis. I am sure you are aware of the killings that have been going on in Logo, Guma, Agatu and other parts of Benue state by herdsmen. “Do you expect the governor to keep quiet? He will continue to speak and stand for his people.” Ikyur added that there has been a clamour for Ortom to contest for a seat on the senate, but said he is still consulting with God on the way forward. “Governor Ortom is aware of the clamour in many quarters for him to contest for senate in 2023, but in his usual character, he is still consulting with God and will make his intention known in due course,” Ikyur said.
