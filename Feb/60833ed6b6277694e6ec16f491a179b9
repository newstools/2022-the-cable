The management of Ibadan Electricity Distribution Company (IBEDC) says the states under its franchise are experiencing prolonged power outage due to low weekly power allocation to its network by the Transmission Company of Nigeria (TCN). Kikelomo Owoeye, IBEDC’s senior communication officer, disclosed this in a statement issued on Sunday in Osogbo, the Osun capital. Ogun, Ibadan, Oyo, Osun and Kwara are the areas affected by the power outage. Residents have, in the past weeks, complained about “terrible” power supply, with some getting less than 10 hours of power supply in a week. Businesses have also recorded losses as people dealing in perishables complained of goods getting spoilt — a situation that was further worsened by the recent fuel scarcity. According to Owoeye, the weekly power allocation to IBEDC network by TCN dropped from 692.5 megawatts to 368.5 megawatts. “This has led to massive load shedding across our franchise in Ogun, Oyo, Ibadan, Osun and Kwara region,” the statement reads. “Kindly bear with us, as we work with stakeholders in the electricity value chain on sustainable resolution.” Owoeye, however, did not say how long the power outage will last.
