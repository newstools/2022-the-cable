Novak Djokovic, the Serbian tennis player, says he won’t take the COVID-19 vaccine even if the decision rules him out of future competitions and trophies. The world’s number one men’s tennis player spoke in a chat with BBC on Tuesday. The Serbian has been at the centre of the vaccine controversy after he was prevented from participating in the 2022 Australian Open over his refusal to take the COVID-19 jab. The situation forced Djokovic to watch, as a spectator, how Rafael Nadal defeated Daniil Medvedev in the tournament’s final and overtook him and Roger Federer in the all-time men’s standings for grand slam victories. Following the Serbian row with the Australian government, France had announced that “there’s no exemption” for unvaccinated athletes at the upcoming Roland Garros. Daniel Muksch, the biographer of Djokovic, had also claimed that 34-year-old would take the vaccine in order not to miss out on winning more grand slams. But in the latest interview, the 20-time grand slam winner also said he is not associated with the anti-vax movement, adding that he believes in the individual’s right to choose. “I was never against vaccination,” he said. “I understand that globally, everyone is trying to put a big effort into handling this virus and seeing, hopefully, an end soon to this virus. “Vaccination is probably the biggest effort. I fully respect that. But I’ve always supported the freedom to choose what you put into your body. For me that is the essential, it’s really the principle of understanding what is right and what is wrong for you. “Me as an elite professional athlete, I’ve always carefully reviewed, assessed everything that comes in from supplements, food, water, anything that comes into my body as a fuel. Based on all the information that I got I decided against the vaccine. “I understand the consequences of my decision. One of the consequences of my decision was not going to Australia, I was prepared not to go.
