The Edo police command says security operatives have recovered N34.5 million following a recent robbery on some banks in the state. Seven persons, including two police officers, were confirmed dead following an attack by gunmen on four banks and a police station on Thursday. Bello Kontongs, Edo police spokesman, had told TheCable that the armed robbers used dynamite during the attack. “There are four banks that were attacked. We lost two police officers including one from the division that was attacked — a female constable and then a sergeant that is from Auchi,” he said. “So, the total casualties of human beings are seven — two police personnel and five civilians — including a mad man.” Giving an update on the incident in an interview with TheCable on Saturday, Kontongs said the police recovered N34,510,000. He also said the recovery was made possible with the support of vigilante operatives and the chief of the area. Five cars suspected to have been used by the robbers were also said to have been recovered during the joint operation involving police operatives. Meanwhile Phillip Shaibu, Edo deputy governor, paid an assessment visit to the area on Friday.
