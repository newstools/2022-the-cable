Samuel Ortom, governor of Benue, says he was denied access to the Nigerian Air Force (NAF) base in Makurdi, the state capital, on Saturday. According to a statement by Nathaniel Ikyur, his chief press secretary, Ortom said he was stopped at the main entrance of the NAF base on his way to receive Vice-President Yemi Osinbajo. According to the governor, he had received a letter from the state house that Osinbajo would transit through Makurdi on his way to Taraba state for the convocation of the Federal University, Wukari. Ortom said he had planned to attend the burial of Ignatius Ayua, a professor, but had to delegate his deputy to represent him at the funeral, so that he could receive Osinbajo. He said on getting to the main gate of the NAF base, security personnel at the entrance said the governor’s convoy would not be allowed in because they were not informed about the visit to the base to receive the vice-president. He described the action of the security operatives as “politics taken too far”. “Unfortunately, on getting to the main gate of the air force, security personnel at the entrance said the governor’s convoy won’t be allowed in because according to them, they were not informed about the governor’s visit to the base to receive the vice president,” the statement reads. “The Governor wondered why he should be treated like that by the air force personnel in the state where he is the Chief Security Officer of the state. “He vowed to report the matter to the Vice President for necessary action, stressing that there should be a clear difference between politics and governance.”
