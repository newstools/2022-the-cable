The Zamfara state house of assembly has confirmed Muhammad Hassan Nasiha, an All Progressives Congress (APC) senator, as the new deputy governor. Earlier on Wednesday, the state lawmakers impeached Mahdi Aliyu Gusau, the former deputy governor who is a member of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP). The impeachment came shortly after the house had received the report of the seven-member committee set up by Kulu Aliyu, chief judge of the state, to investigate the allegations against Gusau. Following the impeachment of Gusau, the assembly went on a short break. At the resumption of plenary, Nasiru Magarya, speaker of the assembly, read a letter from Bello Matawalle, governor of the state, wherein Nasiha, the senator representing Zamfara central, was nominated. The Zamfara senator was also presented at the plenary and confirmed by the assembly. On February 7, Shamsudeen Basko, chairman of the house standing committee on information, announced the service of an impeachment notice on Gusau. Basko had said the allegations against Gusau include “insubordination, abuse of office, and criminal self-enrichment”. On June 29, 2021, Matawalle defected from the PDP to the All Progressives Congress (APC) after months of denials and speculations. Following Matawalle’s defection, the impeached deputy governor refused to leave PDP, pledging his loyalty to the opposition party.
