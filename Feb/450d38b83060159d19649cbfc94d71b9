Moussa Faki Mahamat, the outgoing chairperson of the African Union (AU) Commission, has expressed concern over the security situation on the continent. According to NAN, Mahamat spoke while addressing the 35th Ordinary Session of the AU Assembly in Addis Ababa on Saturday. He said, “the security situation in the continent today is deeply marked by terrorism and the dangerous resurgence of unconstitutional changes of governments.” Mahamat added that terrorism and violent extremism was Africa’s security challenge in 2021, with international terror links embedded in various regions of the continent.

The chairperson further said financing the continent’s development through an energetic fight against illicit capital flows and the establishment of African financial institutions remained a challenge. In 2022, the continent has witnessed two coup attempts — a successful one in Burkina Faso and a failed plot in Guinea Bissau. On Saturday, President Muhammadu Buhari reiterated that Nigeria will continue to pursue peace and progress in Africa and other parts of the world. According to Femi Adesina, presidential spokesman, Buhari said Nigeria remains unwavering in supporting democracy, development and good governance, particularly in ensuring the rights of individuals and institutions.
