Timipre Sylva, minister of state for petroleum resources, says he is confident that the country will convert about 200,000 petrol-powered vehicles to autogas in one year. Sylvia spoke on Tuesday when he featured as a guest on ‘Good Morning Nigeria’, a programme on the Nigerian Television Authority (NTA). TheCable had earlier reported the federal government’s plans to commence the conversion from March 2021. According to Sylva, many countries have declared interest in partially funding the autogas project, adding that the country will also finance part of it. “We can do very confidently, 200,000 vehicles in a year. After a while, other people will also take it up,” he said. “A lot of countries have shown interest. We have engaged the countries and finally, Mr President has agreed for us to take it to the council so that we can come up with the frameworks for disbursing some of the funding. “Some countries have already agreed to fund us halfway, and of course, we are also going to fund halfway. This funds will support the development of the infrastructure.” The minister expressed concern over quack vulcanizers who might emerge as conversion experts with cheap services, adding that it could hinder the progress of the autogas project. “What we are being very careful about as far this conversion process is concerned is the Nigerian factor. A lot of quacks will come in, all kinds of vulcanizers along the road will now become conversion experts and then because they are cheaper, Nigerians can go and convert their cars, and you know what that means for the country,” he added.
