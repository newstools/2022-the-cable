Noah’s Ark Communication, Finland‘s Mandag and Kenya’s 5ive Africa have launched Committed Collective, a cross-continental impact marketing network. The initiative, launched on February 14, 2022, was described as “a growing group of independent creative agencies devoted to helping clients focus on the things that matter and impact society”. The group aims to harness the combined forces of its current and future members to solve sustainability challenges facing businesses across the globe. Speaking on the launch, Lanre Adisa, chief executive officer of Noah’s Ark, said the network will prioritise the creation of value. “We’ve entered a new phase in business. We call it the impact era. It is a profound shift in how companies define their reason for being and how they create new value,” he said. Jonah Otieno, chief executive officer of 5ive Africa, said the group is committed to assisting companies in thriving, considering the different challenges confronting businesses in today’s world. “In a world plagued by climate disasters, health crises, social emergencies, and extinction events, companies have a new role to play. Purpose, sustainability, and positive impact are the only ways you can be meaningful for consumers, customers, citizens, employees, and investors alike,” he said. “With our unique network, we provide you with the best creative talent for accelerating sustainability and real positive impact, both locally and globally.” Arto Sivonen, creative director of Måndag, said members would collaborate with private companies and governments by deploying creative talents to understand the challenges and opportunities available to drive sustainable changes and impact. He added that the group would take the lead in creating content that would make a significant difference in society and help move businesses forward.
