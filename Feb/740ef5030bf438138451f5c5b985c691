Sharon Ikeazor, minister of state for environment, says Nigeria will launch a national strategy plan that will enable it to combat illegal wildlife crime in the country. Ikeazor said this in Abuja on Monday during the ministerial press briefing on the environment sector. She said the strategic plan set to be launched on March 3 will help facilitate the implementation of policies aimed at protecting, restoring and promoting sustainable biodiversity use. She said the country will begin implementation of the 2022-2026 national biosecurity policy and action plan to minimise biological threats to humans and the environment. “Nigeria recently developed the national strategy plan on combating illegal wildlife and forest crime in Nigeria in collaboration with the UNODC, this is due to be launched on the 3rd of March,” she said. “This strategy document will not only facilitate the implementation of our policies and initiative aimed at protecting, restoring and promoting the sustainable use of our biodiversity. “The National Park Services has been in collaboration with NESREA and other relevant agencies like the Nigerian Customs Service to check illegal trafficking and trade in endangered species of wildlife in Nigeria and have made considerable success with seizures. Sensitization campaigns against illegal wildlife are being carried out across the country. “We are commencing the Implementation of the National Biosecurity Policy and Action Plan 2022-2026, to guarantee a functional biosecurity system using the one-health approach to minimizing the risks of biological threats to biodiversity and to humans.”
