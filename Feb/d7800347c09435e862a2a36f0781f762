The Federal Airports Authority of Nigeria (FAAN) says Nigerians will still fly regardless of hike in aviation fares. FAAN explained that the rise in airfares was due to a hike in aviation fuel and the country’s exchange rate. Kunle Akinbode, head of corporate communications, Port Harcourt International Airport, said this in an interview with NAN on Monday. Nigerian airlines recently increased the cost of economy flight tickets for domestic routes from about N35,000 to a base fare of N50,000. On how the new rate is affecting passengers, Akinbode noted that patronage was considerably good irrespective of the high flight rate. “Nigerians will still fly irrespective of the cost because speed and security is a major advantage of air transportation over the road,” he said. Akinbode blamed the recent hike in airfare on the increased cost of aviation fuel and exchange rate. According to him, aviation fuel, which sold for about N250 per litre, now sells for more than N400 per litre. “FAAN and other regulatory agencies in the aviation industry are conscious of the plight of airport users, especially in respect to increased airfare by the various airlines,” he said. “Currently, aviation fuel is selling for over N400 per litre, all aircraft components/parts required for operations are imported, so this has invariably affected airfare.”
