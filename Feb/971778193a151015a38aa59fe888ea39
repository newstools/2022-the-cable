The management of Egbin Power Plc says its facility in Ikorodu, Lagos state, has resumed operations following the recent fire incident at the plant. A fire incident at the power plant on Wednesday had led to a significant drop in power generation and subsequent a blackout in Lagos state. The development led to the shutdown of power generation by the company, coupled with the load reduction mechanism adopted by the Transmission Company of Nigeria (TCN) to prevent system collapse. In a statement on Saturday, the company announced that the plants have resumed electricity generation. “Unit (STO5) was put back in service and synchronised to the national grid at 7:57 p.m. on Feb. 4 and is back on stream generating 220MW,” the company said. “The technical team at the plant is working tirelessly to ensure that an additional 660MW is added to the grid before the weekend runs out. “Egbin continues to work with the regulatory authorities and other stakeholders to achieve full restoration in line with global health, safety, and environmental standards.” The company reiterated its commitment to bringing energy to life responsibly through safe, innovative and sustainable power generation. Egbin is Nigeria’s largest power generating station.
