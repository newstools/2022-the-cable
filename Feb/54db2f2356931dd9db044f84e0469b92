President Muhammadu Buhari has conferred the Nigerian National Order of Merit Award on three scholars. Recipients of the award are Oluyinka Olutoye, a surgeon; the late Charles Chidume, a professor of mathematics; and Godwin Ekhaguere, a professor of mathematical physics. Olutoye was named winner in medicine (2020), Charles Chidume got the award in science (2020), while Godwin Ekhaguere emerged winner in science (2021). Olutoye, an alumnus of Obafemi Awolowo University (OAU), was selected for the award for his role in the groundbreaking surgery that saved a 23-week old foetus from a life-threatening tumour. Chidume, a professor of mathematics at the African University of Science and Technology, Abuja, was selected for the award for introducing a new and powerful interactive algorithm. The algorithm is the only one in the literature that does not involve the resolvent for approximating a zero of the maximal monotone map. Ekhaguere, a mathematician, was selected for creating new directions in mathematics and deploying the outcomes to solve outstanding problems in a branch of mathematical physics called axiomatic quantum field theory. The event took place at the presidential villa, Abuja.
