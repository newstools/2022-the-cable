Explosions were reportedly heard in Kyiv, Kharkiv, Kramatorsk and other parts of Ukraine. On Tuesday, Boris Johnson, Prime minister of the United Kingdom, said Russia and Vladimir Putin had now “plainly” violated Ukrainian sovereignty and “completely torn up international law”. The European Union and the United States have also vowed to impose significant sanctions against those involved in the invasion. Joe Biden, the United States President, condemned the attacks, describing them as unprovoked. Biden said the US and its allies — members of the North Atlantic Treaty Organisation (NATO) — would deliver a decisive response.
