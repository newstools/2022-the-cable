Bashir Magashi, minister of defence, has directed graduates of the Nigerian Defence Academy (NDA) to set new records of gallantry while carrying out their duties. Magashi spoke on Saturday as the reviewing officer at the passing-out parade of the cadets in Kaduna. A total of 295 cadets, who just completed the short service course 47, were commissioned into the Nigerian Army. The defence minister charged the new officers to serve with honesty and as good ambassadors to the country. “As you graduate today, you will be joining the corps of gallant Nigerian Army officers leading soldiers in various theatres of operations across the country,” NAN quoted him as saying. “They would support you in building on the foundation laid by the academy. “From today onwards, the army is your tribe and the armed forces your constituency. We expect you to set new records of gallantry in the defence of our country. “Former cadets of this academy did same during the Nigerian civil war — in Chad, Bakassi and ECOMOG operations and more recently, in all the ongoing operations across the country, especially in the northeast. You must remain good ambassadors of Nigeria. “To the two officers from Liberia, note the invaluable role Nigeria played in restoring and stabilising your country. “The sacrifice and gallantry of the Nigerian army during the ECOMOG operations remains a reference point in the region and in the world at large. “Most of the serving and retired generals in the Nigerian Army, including myself and the chief of army staff, remain very proud of our service in Liberia and cherish the friendly relations that exist between our countries. “Therefore, you must serve your country with honour and loyalty.” He said the armed forces and other security agencies will continue to rely on the support of the citizens to collectively tackle issues threatening the security of the country.
