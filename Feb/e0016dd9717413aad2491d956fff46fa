The Nigerian Football Federation (NFF) has confirmed that Ademola Lookman, former England youth player, has finally gotten approval to switch his allegiance to the Super Eagles. In a tweet on his verified Twitter account on Thursday, Amaju Pinnick, NFF president, said Lookman has now been cleared by FIFA, the world football’s governing body, to wear the Nigerian jersey. The NFF boss added that he can’t wait for the 24-year-old to make his debut for the Super Eagles in the nearest future. “I’m also glad to announce that the work we’ve put in has ensured that on-loan Leicester City winger, Ademola Lookman’s application to change his nationality and represent Nigeria has been approved by FIFA,” he tweeted. “Lookman was part of England’s title win at the 2017 U-20 World Cup & brings a winning mentality to our team. I can’t wait to see him make our Super Eagles that more formidable.” Lookman was born in Peckham, London, to his Nigerian parents in 1997. Although he represented England serially across all age-grade, he is yet to make an appearance for the Three Lions. Lookman is also on loan at the King Power Stadium from RB Leipzig, having previously represented Everton and Charlton Athletic. He might get his debut when the Super Eagles of Nigeria face Ghana at Qatar 2022 World Cup qualification play-off billed for next month. Lookman had earlier indicated his interest to represent Nigeria.
