Nigeria’s D’Tigress beat Mali 73-69 on Sunday afternoon to qualify for the 2022 FIBA Women’s World Cup slated for Sydney, Australia later in the year.

The three-time African defending champions, who will be flying the continent’s flag in Sydney, lost their first set 20-22. Just like they did against France on Friday, the Otis Hugley girls did just enough to rally back from a 2-point deficit in the first quarter to snatch a win and book their second consecutive World Cup ticket.
