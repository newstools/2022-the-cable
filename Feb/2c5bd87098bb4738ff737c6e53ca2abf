The Lagos government has pledged to support and partner with Junior Chamber International Nigeria (JCI), Nigeria, in empowering the youths and preparing them for qualitative leadership. Addressing the national delegates of JCI in his office following a recent courtesy visit, Olusegun Dawodu, the commissioner for youth and social development, commended the leadership of the organisation for impacting and adding value to the lives of the youth across the country. “The Ministry of Youth and Social Development is ready to partner with JCI Nigeria organisation in moving the state forward when it comes to youths’ affairs, we cannot do it alone and working together would make things better for our youths,” he said. He said the ministry is open to working on innovative ideas from the youth-centred organisation to ensure the implementation of initiative projects. He further assured the delegates that the ministry would be collaborating with the NGO on its skill-up initiative. “We are currently looking at how we can organise skills related programmes for young people, it will involve various forms of skills and also educating people to enhance youth productivity,” he said. In his remark, Olawale Bakare, JCI national president, appreciated the commissioner for his warm reception of the delegates and assured that the organisation would continue to contribute its quota to national development by grooming young people to be enterprising young leaders. The commissioner endorsed JCI’s newly launched #GetYourPVC campaign aimed at sensitising young people of voting age on the importance of getting their Permanent Voter’s Card (PVC) to exercise their civic responsibility during the coming elections. Oluwatoyin Atanda, the national executive vice-president for South-west, said the campaign has been launched in over 15 local chapters across Lagos and nationwide. Present at the meeting were presidents of the JCI local chapters across Lagos state.
