The Enugu police command, on Monday, said an unidentified male traveller was killed after gunmen attacked a Sienna vehicle in the state. Daniel Ndukwe, spokesperson of the Enugu police command, confirmed the development to NAN. The traveller was said to have boarded the vehicle at the Holy Ghost roundabout axis of Enugu metropolis. The vehicle was reportedly heading to Onitsha in Anambra in the early hours of Monday when the incident occurred. “Yet-to-be identified miscreants, operating in a mini-bus, shot an unidentified male traveller and in the process torched a Sienna vehicle around Holy Ghost Roundabout axis in the early hours of today,” Ndukwe said. “The victim was immediately moved to the hospital for treatment by police operatives, who responded to a distress call on the incident. “He, however, was later confirmed dead by doctors on duty and deposited in the mortuary for preservation and autopsy. “The said area, including other parts of the state, remains relatively peaceful.” The spokesman added that a manhunt for the assailants had been launched. There have been several attacks across states in the south-east in recent months, leading to killings and destruction of property. Although the Indigenous People of Biafra (IPOB) has been accused by security agencies of being behind the attacks — following the declaration and subsequent cancellation of a sit-at-home order in honour of Nnamdi Kanu, its leader — the group has maintained that it has no hand in the violence.
