President Muhammadu Buhari will, on April 19, hold a meeting with heads of security agencies. Abubakar Badaru, governor of Jigawa, disclosed this on Thursday while speaking with state house correspondents after the meeting of the council of state. The meeting with service chiefs, which will be the second of its kind within three weeks, comes amid attacks across the country — including the recent killing of over 100 people in Plateau and Benue states. Speaking on the scheduled meeting with the service chiefs, the Jigawa governor said the president will discuss with the agency heads on the recommendations and comments by the council of state on the worsening insecurity in the country. In recent weeks, from the destruction of public facilities to attempted jailbreaks, kidnapping, train attacks, and killings, the country has been beset by various challenges. In the north, residents remain at the mercy of Boko Haram insurgents and bandits, while in the south, security agencies and government facilities are increasingly becoming targets of attacks by gunmen. This is despite reassurances by the federal government and security agencies on the safety of Nigerians. In the latest attack which occurred on Wednesday, five students of the College of Health Science and Technology in Tsafe town, Zamfara state, were abducted by gunmen.
