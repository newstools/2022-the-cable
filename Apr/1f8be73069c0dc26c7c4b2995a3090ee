Peter Obi, former governor of Anambra state, says Nigerians do not need a consensus presidential candidate but a “problem solver’’ to govern the country. Obi, a presidential hopeful on the platform of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP), spoke on Tuesday while addressing journalists during his consultation meeting with party members in Ebonyi state. Obi said the sentiment of consensus candidates should not be brought to the front burner at this time in the nation’s political history. He said the geopolitical zone of a candidate should also not be an issue as “what Nigeria needs is to salvage the country”. Obi described himself as someone who can fix the country and make it progressive. “Nigerians want a person who will start solving the myriad of problems facing the country,” he said. “They want someone who will secure lives and property; make the country productive; pull the citizens out of poverty, among other capabilities. “This is not an issue of delegates because those with large numbers of delegates are still affected by the nation’s problems. “It is important to consider where people come from in a diverse country such as ours for equity’s sake. “The country, however, needs someone now who will start creating wealth to make the economy viable. “I can fix this country, having a record of being a trader, of operating in the corporate world, and being a governor among other antecedents.”
