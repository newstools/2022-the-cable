Abdulaziz Yari, former governor of Zamfara, and Kabiru Marafa, a former senator, have joined the Peoples Democratic Party from the All Progressives Congress (APC). Bala Mande, Zamfara PDP chairman, announced the defection of the two former APC chieftains on Sunday after a meeting in Gusau, state capital. Mande said Yari and Marafa have agreed to work for the development of the PDP in the state, adding that a date for the reception of the duo will be announced soon. The development put an end to the speculation surrounding the rumoured defection of Yari and Marafa from the APC to the PDP. The duo has been at the centre of the leadership crisis in Zamfara APC — a situation that snowballed to the disqualification of the party in the polls conducted in the state in 2015. The crisis worsened when Bello Matawalle, governor of the state, joined the APC from the PDP. Owing to Matawalle’s defection, Marafa and Yari lost their leadership grip in the Zamfara APC. In June 2021, Marafa said he would resist any attempt by the Zamfara governor to violate the terms of his defection to the APC. In November 2021, Marafa’s APC faction threatened to sue Mai Mala Buni, then APC caretaker chairman, for allegedly taking sides with the faction of Matawalle. Recently, Yari lost out of the APC national chairmanship race after key leaders of the party, including President Muhammadu Buhari, favoured the candidacy of Abdullahi Adamu.
