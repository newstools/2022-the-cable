The house of representatives has approved the sum of N369.136 billion as the budget of the Nigeria Customs Service (NCS) for the 2022 fiscal year. The lower legislative chamber approved the budget on Tuesday after lawmakers considered the report of the committee on customs and excise, chaired by Leke Abejide. The report was considered at the committee of supply chaired by Idris Wase, deputy speaker of the house. A breakdown of the budget showed that the sum of N214.29 billion is budgeted for capital expenditure, N108.85 billion for personnel costs and N45.89 billion for overhead costs. The lawmakers recommended that customs should “as a matter of urgency purchase scanners prior to the commencement of the proposed e-customs for maximum and effective examination of containers at the ports and other designated Nigeria customs service formations to ensure trade facilitation and also ease the way of doing business” in the country. The amount earmarked for the purchase of the scanners is N27.848 billion. The lawmakers also asked the NCS to “make substantial provisions for corporate social responsibility” in communities where the agency operates. “The information required and assistance to tackle smugglers would be provided by the people easily, but as it is now the NCS is seen as an outcast by these communities because they believe customs only wants to benefit from their domain at the expense of their welfare,” the lawmakers added.
