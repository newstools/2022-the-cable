Chris Ngige, minister of labour and employment, says he will soon announce his decision on whether he will contest the presidency in the 2023 general election. Ngige spoke on Saturday when he met his supporters in Awka, the Anambra capital. While addressing the supporters, the former Anambra governor said he has consulted widely and the time has come for him to reveal his decision. “I was earlier ambushed in Enugu. I didn’t know a second ambush was waiting for me here. But this one is more dangerous, because in Enugu, they can let me go to Anambra, but this one, you have said you won’t let me go back to Abuja until I speak to you and answer your request made on 31st of December,” he said. “I want to assure you that the period of lent, we ended it last night. And during this period, we communed with God; we did our fasting; we talked to God and the angels and God spoke back to us. God has spoken to me. “Resurrection morning is tomorrow. I want to assure you that I will also not disappoint you. I will speak to you in the language you will understand and the language you will like. It will be very soon — either Tuesday or Wednesday before I go back to Abuja.” He also spoke on his achievements as governor of Anambra, adding that the developmental projects which he executed in the state, no other governor has done as much.
