The European Union has called for an increased supply of Liquefied Natural Gas (LNG) from Nigeria into Europe. Samuela Isopi, European Union (EU) ambassador to Nigeria, said this on Monday when she led a delegation to the Nigerian National Petroleum Company (NNPC) Limited headquarters. Isopi said at least 40 per cent of Nigeria’s LNG was exported to Europe, stressing the need for greater cooperation between Nigeria and the EU in the aspect of a possible increase in LNG supplies. Speaking on behalf of the delegation, she said the current geopolitical situation in Europe had necessitated the strengthening of the continent’s relations with Nigeria, particularly as regards the supply of gas from Nigeria to EU countries. “Nigeria is the fourth gas supplier to Europe. At least 40 per cent of the Nigerian LNG is currently exported to Europe,” the ambassador said. “We are not only major clients for Nigeria, but we are also major partners in the oil and gas sector because some of the companies that are working with you are from Europe. So we share the same interest and objectives.” Mele Kyari, group managing director (GMD), NNPC, assured the European delegation that the company would continue to deepen its historical relationship with EU companies in Nigeria. This, he said, was to add more value to the NNPC’s business, particularly towards increasing gas supply to the global market and enhancing domestic gas utilisation. Last month, Timipre Sylva, minister of state for petroleum resources, had said Nigeria is ready to offer its services as an alternative gas supplier to Europe. The minister’s call came on the heels of the festering war between Ukraine and Russia, threatening gas supply to European countries.
