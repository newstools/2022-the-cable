Bala Mohammed, Bauchi governor and presidential hopeful on the platform of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP), has taken a shot at the All Progressives Congress (APC). Speaking on Tuesday night at an event hosted by former ministers appointed by successive PDP governments, Mohammed said the ruling party has destroyed everything. Mohammed described the Buhari government as “nepotistic”, adding that if he is elected as president he will run an inclusive administration. “The nation is in pieces. Nigeria is no longer there under APC. The country is too divided. Why is the country so divided? We must reduce the acrimony. APC has destroyed everything. It is all nepotism,” he said. “We are detribalised as democrats. We cannot be a regionalized government.” Mohammed said there is the need to reduce the country’s borrowing which has risen under the Buhari administration. “You will help make Nigeria great again by collaborating together in this effort,” he said. “We shall not take APC for granted. They are planning all sorts of intimidations but we are steadfast.” On his part, Saminu Turaki, chairman of the PDP ex-ministers forum, said Mohammed is one of the “forces” that will restore the opposition party to a pace-setter role.
