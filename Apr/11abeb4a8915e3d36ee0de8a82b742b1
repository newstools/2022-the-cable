Solomon Dalung, former minister of youth and sports, has resigned his membership of the All Progressives Congress (APC). Dalung presented his letter of resignation to the APC ward chairman in Sabin-Gida, Langtang south LGA of Plateau state. The former minister, who said his resignation from the APC is effective immediately, added that the recent developments in the party are incompatible with his values. “This is to convey my withdrawal of membership from the All Progressives Congress with effect from the date of this notice,” the letter signed on April 18 reads. “It is worthy of mention that recent developments in the party conflict with my core principles of values which define the basis of allegiance to the party. “Of note is the fact that internal democracy is critical to the survival of representative democracy without which political participation remains a mirage.” Dalung served as minister from 2015 to 2019. He took to criticising the APC after he was not reappointed by President Muhammadu Buhari. In January, the former minister said the APC failed Nigerians by not delivering on its campaign promises.
