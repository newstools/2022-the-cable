Eunice, mother of Samuel Nda-Isaiah who founded Leadership newspaper, is dead. According to Leadership newspaper, Joseph Nda-Isaiah, in a statement on behalf of the family, said she died on Friday in Abuja. Eunice’s death comes 15 months after the death of her son. Samuel Nda-Isaiah died in December 2020. He was aged 58. According to the statement, Eunice was born in 1942 in the old Kabba province of northern Nigeria, and lived in Kano, Kaduna, and Niger states. She got married in 1961 to Clement Ndanusa-Isaiah, a senior editor in New Nigerian and Triumph newspapers, and “was fondly called ‘Mama Sam’, improvised from the name of her first son and founder of Leadership, Mr. Sam Nda-Isaiah”. “We will miss Mama dearly for her sacrificial love and devotion to her family,” the statement reads. “We’re comforted that she was a woman of faith and has gone to be with the Lord, who loves her more.” The family added that burial arraignments would be announced later.
