Ibrahim Abdullahi, senator representing Sokoto south, has defected from the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) to the All Progressives Congress (APC). His notice of defection was in a letter read by Senate President Ahmad Lawan on the floor of the upper legislative chamber on Wednesday. In his letter, Abdullahi cited “crisis” as the reason for defecting to the ruling party. But Philip Aduda, minority whip and senator representing the federal capital territory, protested against the defection. Aduda said there is no crisis in the opposition party as claimed by the Sokoto senator. Responding to the minority whip’s comment, Lawan said if Abdullahi claims that there is a crisis in his place it is because he is knowledgeable about it. “If someone says in his place, this is the situation and the senator representing FCT would say no, it doesn’t exist, I think we should ask if it is you that know better or him that represents that constituency,” the senate president said.
