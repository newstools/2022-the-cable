Peter Obi, a former governor of Anambra, has asked delegates of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) to “collect money if it is offered”, but they should make informed decisions while voting to elect the party’s presidential candidate. Obi is one of the presidential hopefuls gunning for the ticket of the PDP. The former Anambra governor spoke on Tuesday at a meeting with PDP stakeholder at the party’s secretariat in Ibadan, the Oyo capital. The former Anambra governor said Nigerians need to make informed decisions about electing a president who will have the capacity to resolve the country’s problems. He promised to replicate his achievements as governor of Anambra if elected as the president of Nigeria in 2023. ‘You are delegates. People are going to give you money; people are going to give you everything. If they give you money, take it. It’s your money anyway. But when you want to vote, consider the future of your children. Pray over it,” he said. “All I have come here to do is to introduce myself. Oyo state, I have introduced myself and told you my background. “But I beg you, make informed decision such that you will be able to say that my children can live in a better society.” On the issue of consensus, the former Anambra said there is no consensus even in the north, adding that there are 12 presidential aspirants from the north. “On the issue of consensus, let me be honest with you, in the north, there is no consensus. The aspirants from the north are 12,” he added. “In America, 30 people contested the election. In the south, how many of us? We are barely about eight. “So, what is good is to listen to the eight of us, check the backgrounds of the eight of us, and decide who you are going to support.”
