The League Management Company (LMC) has commenced the 2022 Nigeria Professional Football League (NPFL) U-15 youth league at the Remo Stars stadium in Ikenne, Ogun state. The youth league, which is in partnership with La Liga, began on Friday. The tournament would be competed for by the junior teams of all the NPFL clubs. LMC also penned a partnership deal with MTN, the telecommunication giant, to support grassroots football development in Nigeria. In a Twitter thread, the league management said the deal “will ensure continuous local & international exposure for Nigerian youth football.” It also added that local coaches would have the opportunity to learn from “seasoned La Liga coaches” in a one-week seminar. “MTN Nigeria, the NPFL & LaLiga have announced a partnership to support the development of grassroots football in Nigeria, through the establishment of the NPFL/La Liga U-15 Youth League,” the tweet read. “The partnership will ensure continuous local & international exposure for Nigerian youth football, capacity building for players and coaching talents, which ultimately contribute to the advancement of developmental football in the country. “There will be a one-week coaching seminar to see seasoned LaLiga coaches interact with their local counterparts on modern youth coaching techniques ahead of the tournament. “Forty NPFL coaches, national team coaches, as well as other youth coaches across the country will benefit from the seminar.” In the tournament’s first game, Kano Pillars’ youth side defeated their Lobi Stars counterpart 3-2. The NPFL/La Liga youth league was established in 2017 and has produced a handful of talents who have been promoted into the first team of their various clubs.
