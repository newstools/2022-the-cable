Ben Ayade, governor of Cross River, has presented vehicles to newly-appointed judges in the state. Making the presentation on Wednesday, the governor also promised to make improvements on the welfare of the judges. According to a statement by the Cross River government, he described the gesture as a way of appreciating the judges for “standing with the truth”. Present at the event was Akon Ikpeme, the chief judge of the state, who received the keys to the vehicles on behalf of the recipients. “I’m here with the chief judge of Cross River state, justice Akon Ikpeme. I’m here to make a presentation to our judicial officers, the vehicles that befit their status, because I have seen that the Nigerian judiciary is a dependable arm of government, an arm of government that gives hope to the common man, an arm of government that dispenses justice,” he was quoted as saying. “I’m particularly happy and I’m using this opportunity to express my gratitude to the Nigerian judiciary for standing on the side of the law, by standing with the truth. “Against this background, the people of Cross River state want to show appreciation to the judiciary. On behalf of the government and people of Cross River state, I hereby present these jeeps and cars to you.” Meanwhile, the presentation of the vehicles comes days after a federal high court in Abuja dismissed a suit filed against the governor by the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) seeking his removal over his defection to the All Progressives Congress (APC).
