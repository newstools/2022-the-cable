Kola Abiola, son of the late MKO Abiola, has joined the Peoples Redemption Party (PRP). Kola was formally accepted into the PRP on Thursday at its national secretariat in Abuja by Falalu Bello, the national chairman of the party. He said his decision to join PRP was based on the party’s prioritised internal democracy. “I particularly picked to come back into politics through the PRP for some good reasons,” NAN quoted him as saying. “I have gone back to the history of Nigeria to look at the party that truly represents Nigeria. “I have gone back and I have found out that the oldest living party is the PRP; it still holds those ideals of what Nigeria and democratic practice should be like.” Speaking on the need for youths to take active part in politics, he said young people have the highest population but are caught outside the political system. “The first thing I want to do is to disrupt the political process, to disabuse the minds of the youth on godfatherism,” he said. “The way to do this is to give the true owners of Nigeria, that is the 18 to 36 years age group that makes up over 75 percent of the population, an opportunity for their voices to be heard and their numbers to count.” He said PRP is the only party that can give youths such an opportunity to make their numbers count.
