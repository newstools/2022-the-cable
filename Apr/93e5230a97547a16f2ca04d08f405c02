The federal government says a detailed investigation into the causes of the recurring grid collapse is ongoing. TheCable had reported that the national electricity grid suffered a system collapse on Friday — the third incident in less than one month. According to a statement on Saturday, Isa Sanusi, media spokesperson of the ministry of power, said efforts are ongoing to restore supply. Sanusi said the Nigerian Electricity Regulatory Commission (NERC), the operator of the national grid, is in the process of restoring supply. “We wish to notify the general public of the incidence of a system collapse which occurred at 1830 hrs on April 8th, 2022 resulting in power outages in many parts of the country,” the statement reads. “While a detailed investigation into the immediate and remote causes of the recurring grid failure is currently ongoing by the Nigerian Electricity Regulatory Commission and System Operator (the operator of the national grid), the process of restoring supply is ongoing with some sections of the national grid already energised and supply restored to consumers. “We wish to assure Nigerians that the Federal Government is working assiduously to deliver on the much-needed reforms and investments, including SCADA, that are critical to improving the capacity and reliability of the national grid. “This is in line with the Mr. President’s directives on closing infrastructure deficits in critical sectors of the Nigerian economy.” On March 19, Abubakar Aliyu, minister of power had assured Nigerians that measures to avoid the recurrence of national grid collapse were being implemented.
