Gunmen, on Thursday, reportedly set ablaze the home of Ford Ozumba, commissioner for labour, employment and productivity in Imo state. The attack was said to have occurred in the commissioner’s hometown in Umuhu-Okabia community, Orsu LGA of the state. The attackers reportedly threw petrol bombs into the compound. Confirming the incident on Friday, Ford said the attack recorded no casualty as there was nobody in the house at the time of the incident. “We were all in Owerri only to learn this morning that my family house had been burnt down,” he said. “I was told that the attackers wreaked the havoc in the dead of the night. They threw petrol bombs into the compound. “What a sad day. My family compound in my village has been razed down by hoodlums last night.” The incident is the latest in a battery of attacks targeted at the homes of government officials and residents in the state. Earlier in March, the house of George Obiozor, president-general of Ohanaeze Ndigbo worldwide, was set ablaze by gunmen in Imo. In April 2021, the country home of Hope Uzodimma, governor of Imo, was attacked, with a section of the building razed, while two security guards were killed. Weeks after the attack on Uzodimma’s house, the home of Declan Emelumba, Imo commissioner for information and strategy, was set ablaze when gunmen invaded the compound in Ubulu-Ihejiofor, Oru West LGA of the state.
