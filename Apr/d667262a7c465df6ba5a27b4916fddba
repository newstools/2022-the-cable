Seyi Makinde, governor of Oyo, has described the demise of Lamidi Adeyemi, the Alaafin of Oyo, as a loss to the Yoruba people. The Alaafin of Oyo died on Friday night. He was aged 83. In a statement issued on Saturday by Taiwo Adisa, his chief press secretary, Makinde said the late monarch dedicated his life to promoting peace, adding that Adeyemi was a model of excellence in royal leadership in Africa. “I express heartfelt condolences to the Oyo State Council of Obas and Chiefs, which Oba Adeyemi chaired for decades, the Oyomesi and the entire people of Oyo Kingdom,” the statement reads. “I equally commiserate with the Oloris, children and entire Adeyemi family on the demise of their patriarch and worthy father. “Kabiyesi’s departure is a huge loss not only to Oyo State, to which he committed 52 years of his life as the Alaafin of Oyo Kingdom, but also to Nigeria and the entire Yoruba race. “Oba Adeyemi was our last man standing in the rank of most eminent royal fathers with long years of leadership. “He became a golden king, an institution and an authority rolled into one by virtue of his immense experience, wisdom and understanding of Yoruba history, royalty and politics. “Oba Adeyemi not only elevated the Alaafin throne with his knowledge and wisdom, he became a worthy exemplar for royal leadership in Africa and brought glory to Oyo State and Nigeria. “Kabiyesi never spared anything in his strive to make Oyo State greater and to bring about the Nigeria of everyone’s collective dream.”
