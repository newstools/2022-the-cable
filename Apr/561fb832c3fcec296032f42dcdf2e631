Dele Momodu, a presidential hopeful on the platform of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP), says he will remain in the race till the date of the presidential primary. The primary to select a candidate to represent the PDP in the 2023 presidential election is scheduled for May 28. Speaking on Friday after appearing before the party’s screening committee in Abuja, the publisher of Ovation Magazine said the exercise was successful, adding that members of the committee are among “the most experienced members” of PDP. “I was very excited to see them. It was a very straightforward exercise. I’m looking forward to robust engagement with Nigerians in the coming days and weeks,” he said. “It is going to be exciting. Anyone who feels Dele Momodu is here to waste time or to step down for somebody, tell them that Dele Momodu is a man of principle. “My message to the delegates is that they should not sell their conscience; they should vote their conscience. “I don’t have money but I have integrity, I have a reputation, I have a global brand. Our founding fathers in Nigeria, chief Obafemi Awolowo, Nnamdi Azikiwe — they all had journalism background.” Momodu also said Nigeria needs a president who can take decisions that will have a positive impact on citizens’ lives. “The world can only be changed by intellectuals and not by money. Everywhere in the world now, people are electing superstars. You need somebody who has been interacting with Nigerians to be president and will be able to take charge from day one,” he added. “It is going to be exciting. Anyone who feels Dele Momodu is here to waste time or to step down for somebody, tell them that Dele Momodu is a man of principle.
