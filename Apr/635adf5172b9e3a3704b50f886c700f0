The zoning committee of the the Peoples Democratic Party has concluded its deliberations on its recommendation for zoning of the party’s presidential ticket. Samuel Ortom, governor of Benue and chairman of the zoning committee, spoke on Tuesday in Abuja. The 37-member zoning committee, which include Ifeanyi Ugwuanyi and Darius Ishaku, governors of Enugu and Taraba, respectively, was inaugurated on March 24. Speaking to journalists, Ortom said the report will be submitted to the national executive committee (NEC) of the party. “We have just finished our meeting after we rose from our meeting last week,” he said. “Today, we decided that we would meet and by the grace of God, we have unanimously adopted a position that will be sent to the NEC of our party that appointed us. “The good news for our teeming supporters of the PDP and Nigerians is that we have resolved and everyone of us — the 37 members — unanimously adopted the position that we are going to present to NEC.” Although Ortom didn’t give exact details on the committee’s recommendation, there are unconfirmed reports that the panel recommended that the zoning of the presidential ticket be thrown open. The zoning of the PDP presidential ticket has been a subject of debate ahead of the party’s primary. While some members of the party from the south are demanding that the ticket be zoned to the region, those from the north want it to be thrown open. Meanwhile, former Senate President Bukola Saraki, as well as PDP governors such as Ifeanyi Okowa of Delta, Aminu Tambuwal of Sokoto, and Godwin Obaseki of Edo have expressed their support for the possibility of a consensus candidate.
