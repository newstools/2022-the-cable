Five persons returning from a traditional wedding ceremony in Anambra state have been abducted. Toochukwu Ikenga, police public relations officer in Anambra, confirmed the incident in a statement issued on Tuesday. Ikenga said the guests were kidnapped on Monday night, adding that security operatives have launched a rescue operation to ensure that the victims are safely reunited with their families. According to NAN, a source said the five abductees were men. “The guests were kidnapped at gunpoint at about 10pm on the Akpo-Nkpologwu road in Aguata LGA of Anambra,” the source said. “About 15 of the guests were returning to the hotel from Achina, venue of the wedding ceremony, in a convoy of three vehicles when they ran into the abductors. Only the first car was able to escape. “The gunmen asked all the ladies to go and took five of the men away after shooting into the air.” The source added that the kidnappers were yet to make any contact with the victims’ families. The development comes amid a wave of attacks in Anambra in recent months. Among recent incidents recorded include the attack on a police checkpoint in Aguata LGA, which resulted in three officers sustaining injuries. Hours before the attack on the police checkpoint, four officers were killed after gunmen invaded the Atani police station in Ogbaru LGA of the state.
