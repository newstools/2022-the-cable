Abdullahi Ganduje, governor of Kano, says his Rivers counterpart, Nyesom Wike, won’t actualise his presidential ambition. Ganduje spoke this on Monday when he received Wike, who paid him a courtesy call at the government house in Kano. “I have listened to your speech across the country and I said: ‘This Wike is not wicked, but this Wike is wise’,” he said. “So, you have come to see your brothers and sisters. Good. You are aspiring for the president of the Federal Republic of Nigeria. We see your efforts. “And at the end of it, you would lose, but you will be a good loser. I appreciate good losers because they have courage and since you are doing it peacefully, you will live long to fight again. “In a democracy, if we all belong to one party, then there is no democracy and I foresee good efforts in your presidential bid. You will lose, but you will be a good loser and live to fight a good fight.” Ganduje said the country’s diversity should be an advantage, adding that every person has the responsibility of driving change. The Kano governor also said his Rivers counterpart has demonstrated his belief in a united Nigeria. “Party differences should not make us stupid. Our diversity is an advantage, even though we failed to utilise our diversity. Each one of us must try in his own bid to change the status quo,” he added.
