Sheikh Nuru Khalid has been sacked as the chief imam of the Apo legislative quarters Juma’at mosque in Abuja. The Islamic cleric was initially suspended for his anti-government sermon during the Jummat service on Friday. He criticised the government for its inadequacy in dealing with rising insecurity in the country. In his sermon, the cleric asked citizens not to vote for any politician who cannot guarantee the safety of lives and properties of Nigerians. “The condition of the Nigerian masses is one. Stop killing us. We will not go to the polls, since you have nothing to do but vote,” Khalid had said. Saidu Muhammed Dansadau, chairman of the mosque committee, said the cleric’s teachings of political apathy are un-Islamic. Consequently, he was suspended from his position. Reacting to his suspension, Khalid said only God can give or take power from anyone. In a letter addressed to the Imam on Monday, the mosque committee said he had shown no “remorse” despite his suspension. The committee said his reaction did not show any form of regret following his sermon. “Unfortunately, your media reaction to the suspension creates the impression that you are not remorseful,” the letter reads in part. “Leadership demands a great sense of responsibility.” An official of the mosque who spoke to TheCable via telephone also confirmed his dismissal. “It’s true, he was sacked,” the official said.
