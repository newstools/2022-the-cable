The federal government has finally redeemed the house pledge to members of the Super Eagles squad that won the Africa Cup of Nations (AFCON) in 1994. The handing over ceremony was held in Abuja on Friday with Babatunde Fashola, minister of labour and housing, presenting the certificate of occupancy to the ex-internationals. <img class="alignnone wp-image-685231" src="https://f5p3e9e4.stackpathcdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/IMG-20220408-WA0024.jpg" alt="" width="550" height="401" srcset="https://f5p3e9e4.stackpathcdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/IMG-20220408-WA0024.jpg 1080w, https://f5p3e9e4.stackpathcdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/IMG-20220408-WA0024-300x219.jpg 300w, https://f5p3e9e4.stackpathcdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/IMG-20220408-WA0024-1024x747.jpg 1024w, https://f5p3e9e4.stackpathcdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/IMG-20220408-WA0024-768x560.jpg 768w, https://f5p3e9e4.stackpathcdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/IMG-20220408-WA0024-24x18.jpg 24w, https://f5p3e9e4.stackpathcdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/IMG-20220408-WA0024-36x26.jpg 36w, https://f5p3e9e4.stackpathcdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/IMG-20220408-WA0024-48x35.jpg 48w" sizes="(max-width: 550px) 100vw, 550px" /> Members of the AFCON-winning squad present include Victor Ikpeba, Augustine Eguavoen, Peter Rufai, among others. The ex-players are getting the houses close to a year after President Muhammadu Buhari approved the allocation of three-bedroom apartments in their states of preference. Wilfred Abonavalle, Uche Okafor, Thompson Oriha and Stephen Keshi are deceased members of the 1994 squad. The Clemens Westerhoff-tutored side beat Zambia 2-1 to clinch the AFCON title.
