Abdullahi Adamu, national chairman of the All Progressives Congress (APC), hosted Rotimi Amaechi, minister of transportation, on Sunday. The minister met with the APC chairman in Keffi, Nasarawa state. In April, Amaechi, a former Rivers governor, joined the presidential race. The APC chairman also hosted Mai Mala Buni, governor of Yobe state. In March, Adamu was elected national chairman via consensus, taking over from Buni, who is the former chairman of the caretaker committee. Here are some photos from both visits: <img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-688207" src="https://f5p3e9e4.stackpathcdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/FQjn1y-XMAY35xb-e1650215303456.jpg" alt="" width="600" height="423" /> <img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-688206" src="https://f5p3e9e4.stackpathcdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/FQjn7ouXwAMz5-C-e1650215283440.jpg" alt="" width="600" height="418" /> <img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-688205" src="https://f5p3e9e4.stackpathcdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/FQjoCRNWQAAscDh-e1650215265373.jpg" alt="" width="600" height="427" />
