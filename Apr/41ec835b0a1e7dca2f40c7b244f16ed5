Gunmen have reportedly abducted an unconfirmed number of persons along the Tapila-Gwada road, an area located in Shiroro LGA of Niger state. The gunmen were said to have attacked the area on Saturday at about 7pm. The Gwada community is a 30-minute drive from Minna, Niger’s capital city. During the raid that is said to have lasted almost an hour, one person was killed, it was learnt. A resident of the community told TheCable that two of her cousins were among the residents that the gunmen abducted. According to her, many people had to run into the bush for safety and only came out after the gunmen had left. “These people came from the bush. Two of my cousins were taken. Deborah is one of them. This girl just finished secondary school,” the distressed resident, who simply identified herself as Theresa, said. “She has been waiting for admission into a nursing school. Now this has happened. It is really hard on my family, I hope they get rescued soon.” When contacted, Wasiu Abiodun, spokesman of the Niger state police command, confirmed the attack. “Let me get details; I will get back to you,” he said. Communities in the north-central and north-west zones have been recording an increase in the activities of gunmen in recent months.
