Faruk Yahaya, chief of army staff, has reiterated the commitment of the Nigerian army to deal with all forms of insecurity confronting the country. Yahaya gave the assurance at a one-day seminar on ‘Intensifying Warrior Ethos’ organised by the army headquarters department of transformation and innovation, on Tuesday, in Abuja. Represented by Anthony Omozoje, army chief of policy and plans, the COAS said the volatile and complex security emergencies facing the nation had necessitated the continuous review of the national security architecture to contain the threats. He said the varied acts of insurgency, terrorism, kidnapping, banditry and other terrorist organisations have continued to pose substantive threats to the nation. Yahaya, however, said the troops have continued to “respond assiduously to contain and decimate all adversaries of Nigeria” in line with his message that all adversaries of Nigeria must be defeated decisively. According to him, sustaining and insisting on a winning mentality must be inculcated into all troops. “Let me also seize this opportunity to reiterate the unwavering commitment of the President, Commander-In-Chief of the Armed Forces for his invaluable support to the Nigerian army towards ensuring success in our various operations,” he added. “We must on our part, continue to justify these resources and goodwill by consistently executing all assigned tasks swiftly and in the most efficient and professional manner as warriors.”
