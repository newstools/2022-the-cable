Ivie Uhunoma, wife of Tsola Emiko, the Olu of Warri, held the second edition of Wuwu Ore medical and welfare outreach in Ugbolokposo community in Delta state over the weekend. The quarterly outreach, established in 2021, is geared towards providing medical care and palliatives for children, women and youths in the remotest riverine areas of the Warri kingdom and its environs. During the visit, women of the community hailed the queen for her gesture, describing her presence in the area as “historic”. Utake Ovwe, the lead medical consultant of the outreach, said his team remains committed to achieving the queen’s desire to cater to the most vulnerable indigenes of the kingdom, particularly women and children. “Our goal is to continue to educate and care for various communities within the Kingdom, providing expert medical care as well as palliatives and empowerment packages until the indigenes of Warri Kingdom become more economically stable and self-reliant,” Utake said. The Wuwu Ore outreach provided a wide range of medical services in dentistry, ophthalmology, pediatrics and other specialist fields. Expectant and new mothers were also guided through healthcare talks and child-mother safety consultations while out-patient units were also set up for HIV screenings, retroviral treatments, and COVID-19 tests. In her remark, Olori Atuwatse III hailed the community leaders for mobilising residents for the outreach. She also commended the National Agency for the Control of AIDS (NACA), Delta State Agency for AIDS Control (DELSACA), the Maden Foundation, Caritas Nigeria, Association of Public Health Physicians of Nigeria (APHPN), and the state chapter of the Medical Women Association of Nigeria (MWAN) Delta state for their support. “With all your valued support, we can touch more lives and change the fortunes of our people in no distant time,” she said. At the end of the outreach, residents were given Wuwu Ore kits and food items like rice, beans, and other grains.
