A Nigerian Air Force (NAF) fighter jet targeting terrorists has reportedly killed six children in Niger state. The incident took place in the Kurebe area of Shiroro LGA on April 13. TheCable understands that the community has been under relentless attacks by terrorists. Salis Sabo, spokesperson of the Coalition of Shiroro Association (COSA), disclosed this in a statement on Wednesday. Sabo said the children were hit by the airstrike when they were returning home from where they had gone to fetch water. He said two of the victims were orphans whose parents were killed during a bandit attack on the village. “A man who lost two of his daughters and granddaughters in the incident said there was no single bandit within the village at the time the aircraft bombarded the innocent children,” Sabo said. “He added that the terrorist camps are well known. He said the terrorists around the community are of two groups, with two different camps. One links up with the community through Unguwan Zomo, the other through Kwantan Yashi area. Therefore, they do not understand why fighter jet would be targeting the community where civilians live. “The two other children who lost their lives in the incidents have for long lost their parents. One of them is a daughter of late Malam Isah Kurebe and the other is a daughter of late Malam Adamu Kurebe, who was killed by the terrorists two years ago. The innocent child he left behind has now been taken away by a similar fate. This is the second time this type of incident is happening.” When contacted by TheCable, Edward Gabkwet, NAF spokesperson, refused to comment on the matter.
