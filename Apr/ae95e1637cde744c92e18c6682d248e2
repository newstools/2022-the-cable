God bless,” he tweeted. I, Hon.

Aminu Suleiman (@HonAminuSuleim) April 20, 2022  Tinubu is one of the frontline runners for the ruling party’s presidential ticket. But the former Lagos governor is up against Vice-President Yemi Osinbajo, David Umahi, governor of Ebonyi; Chris Ngige, minister of labour; Yahaya Bello, governor of Kogi; Rotimi Amaechi, minister of transportation, among others, for the APC ticket. Earlier at the party’s NEC meeting on Wednesday, President Muhammadu Buhari had warned against the imposition of candidates. “I enjoin you all to follow due process in all the party processes and more importantly to develop more mechanisms against corruption,” the president had said. “I call on all party members to abide by all extant laws, rules, and regulations and to leaders of our party to avoid imposition of candidates that cannot win popular elections. “This dictatorial behavior cost us many strategic seats in the past. In the recent past this led to some of our strong members unfortunately opting to go elsewhere because of unfairly oppressive behavior of party leaders at state level.”
