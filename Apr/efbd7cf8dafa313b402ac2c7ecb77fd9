Kayode Fayemi, governor of Ekiti who has expressed interest in contesting the presidency, says the country needs leaders with courage. Fayemi, who is also the chairman of the Nigeria Governors’ Forum (NGF), spoke on Wednesday during a “consultation visit” to Lekan Balogun, the Olubadan of Ibadanland, at the latter’s residence in Ibadan. According to NAN, the Ekiti governor said Nigeria is still worth fighting for in spite of the current challenges, adding that his intention to contest is a call to duty to make Nigeria better. “We need leaders with courage with which to do what is right, which may not be popular,” he said. “What I believe is we want is peace, progress and development of the country. That is what our fathers clamoured for. “Having supported many in the past to get to the apogee, I consider it is time to look in our direction. “I have been consulting and it was the consultation process that brought me before your imperial majesty as the father of politicians.” Fayemi said his position as the NGF chairman has enabled him to know the country better, adding that he has the capacity to address the problems of national cohesion, insecurity and other challenges facing the nation. He sought prayers from the Olubadan, saying the traditional ruler’s position in Yorubaland and Nigeria in general cannot be overemphasised. Responding, Balogun commended Fayemi for his passion for the unity and progress of the country, and praised him for “his ideological orientation, disdain for self-interest, and pursuit of national interest”. He also prayed for the Ekiti governor and wished him good luck in his quest.
