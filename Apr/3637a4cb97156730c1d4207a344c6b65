The Zamfara state government has sent 97 clerics to Saudi Arabia on lesser hajj for prayers against banditry. The clerics are expected to hold prayer sessions in strategic holy places of worship in Makkah and Madina to seek divine intervention on restoring peace in Zamfara and Nigeria in general. According to NAN, Hassan Nasiha, Zamfara deputy governor, while addressing the clerics on Wednesday, urged them to pray for the state and the nation. The deputy governor also wished the clerics a “hitch-free lesser hajj and safe return after the exercise”. Delivering a sermon at a meeting involving the clerics shortly before their departure, Atiku Balarabe, a cleric, briefed the pilgrims on how best to concentrate on their worship and prayers in Saudi Arabia. He advised them to keep in mind that they represent all the people of the state, and to pray for God’s intervention to abolish banditry and other crimes in the state. Balarabe also urged the pilgrims to focus on the prayers in order to match the state’s expectations, given the millions of people who have put their faith in them.
