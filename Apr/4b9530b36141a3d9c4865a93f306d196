Hope Uzodimma, governor of Imo, says the state will overcome its current challenges. Oguwike Nwachuku, his media adviser, said Uzodimma gave the assurance in his Easter message at the St. Rose of Lima Catholic Parish, Ozuh Omuma, Oru east LGA of the state. Uzodimma lamented the killing of innocent citizens, burning of public and private property, police stations, and the killing of policemen. He asked the congregation to join him in asking God to touch the heart of those perpetrating the violence to repent in the spirit of Easter “as we mark the death and resurrection of Jesus Christ”. He said the killings in parts of the state are politically motivated as against reports in some quarters that they are the handiwork of the proscribed Indigenous People of Biafra (IPOB). According to him, personal property of opposition politicians is not affected by the menace in the state, “an indication that politicians could not be exonerated from the killings and wanton destruction of property”. “These are the activities of wicked politicians who are unrepentant and have continued to sponsor the killings of their fellow brothers,” he said. “They are challenging God because when you are after the creation of God, you are after God. “My government is not weak, my government is only God-fearing. The only thing is that we hate to let blood. “We cannot allow the killing of innocent citizens and the activities of non-state actors in the form of criminals and hoodlums to overtake the political space.” He said the killings must stop and called on those behind the acts to repent quickly before the government goes after them.
