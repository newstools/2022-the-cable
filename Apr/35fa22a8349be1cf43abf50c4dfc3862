Abubakar Umar, ex-military governor of Kaduna, has called on the federal government to intensify efforts to rescue persons abducted during the attack on an Abuja-Kaduna train. Photos of the victims surfaced online on Tuesday — the passengers have spent over four weeks in captivity. Umar, in in statement on Wednesday, described the pictures of the abductees as “disturbing”, and urged the international community to assist the federal government to ensure the safe release of the victims. “The pictures, to say the least, are most disturbing, particularly as they show exhausted and frightened women and children under the most harrowing conditions,” the statement reads. “I appeal to the federal government to do more to secure the immediate release of these innocent victims. “I also appeal to the international community, particularly the International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC), to assist in the negotiations which will be needed to effect that release. “May God touch the hearts of the kidnappers to show mercy on these innocent and vulnerable victims. Amen.” On March 28, gunmen attacked an Abuja-Kaduna passenger train and killed eight people, while over 20 persons were injured, and several others abducted. Alwan Hassan, acting managing director of the Bank of Agriculture (BOA), was one of the passengers abducted during the attack on the train. He, however, regained his freedom after nine days in captivity.
