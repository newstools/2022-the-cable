The house of representatives has exonerated oil marketers accused of importing methanol-blended premium motor spirit (PMS) into the country. Duke Oil, MRS Oil, Oando Oil and Emadeb consortium — Hyde, AY Maikifi, Britannia-U — were the oil marketers accused of importing the off-spec PMS. The lower legislative chamber absolved the oil companies of wrongdoing following the consideration and approval of the report of the committee on petroleum resources downstream at the committee of the whole on Thursday. The green chamber said the oil companies “did not commit any offence, therefore not recommended for suspension”. Abdullahi Mahmud Gaya, chairman of the committee on petroleum resources, had submitted the report two weeks ago, but the house refused to consider it and suggested that further works on it. In February, the Nigerian Midstream and Downstream Petroleum Regulatory Authority (NMDPRA) confirmed that petrol with methanol quantities above Nigeria’s specification was discovered in the supply chain. Mele Kyari, group managing director of the Nigerian National Petroleum Company (NNPC) Limited, had said the suppliers imported the methanol-blended petrol. The development caused long queues across Nigeria as many filling stations shut down services. On February 10, the lower legislative chamber asked the NNPC Limited to suspend the companies involved and also mandated its petroleum committees to investigate the matter. After considering the report of the committee on Thursday, the lawmakers approved the seven recommendations therein. Besides absolving the oil companies of blame, the lawmakers asked the Standard Organisation of Nigeria (SON) to henceforth test for methanol on imported petrol in the country. Below are the recommendations approved by the lower legislative chamber:
