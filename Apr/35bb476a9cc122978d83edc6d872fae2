Chelsea were handed a surprise 4-1 drubbing by Brentford in their English Premier League (EPL) encounter at Stamford Bridge on Saturday. The Londoners conceded four second half goals to fall to a surprise defeat after taking the lead. The loss ended Chelsea’s six-match winning streak and Christian Eriksen was again at the heart of Brentford’s surprise but deserved win. Anthony Rudiger gave Chelsea a 48th-minute lead with a 30-yard volley but they were immediately pegged back through Vitaly Janelt’s thunderous shot before Eriksen gave the Bees the lead four minutes later. Janelt made it three before Yoane Wissa pounced on Rudiger’s poor clearance to seal victory for Brentford, earning the side’s first win at Chelsea since 1939. The Blues stay third with 59 points from 29 games while Brentford move closer to safety with 33 points from 31 matches. In the race for the EPL crown, Liverpool defeated Watford 2-0 earlier in the day to take the top spot, but Manchester City reclaimed the position hours later following a 2-0 win at Burnley. A goal in each half from Diogo Jota and Fabinho (penalty) was enough for Liverpool to claim victory, while Manchester City struck through Kevin de Bruyne and Ilkay Gundogan’s first half strikes against toothless and relegation-threatened Burnley. Pep Guardiola’s side has 73 points from 30 matches, one ahead of Liverpool with eight games to the end of the season.
