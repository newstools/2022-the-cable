A support group with the tag, ‘It is Time’, has unveiled a document highlighting what to expect from Vice-President Yemi Osinbajo if he is elected president in 2023. On Monday, Osinbajo finally declared his bid to join the 2023 presidential race after months of speculations. In the declaration speech, the vice-president emphasised the need to build on the achievements of the Muhammadu Buhari administration. Following Osinbajo’s presidential declaration, many of his supporters have started to canvass support for the vice-president’s ambition. The support group tagged ‘It is Time’ released a 32-page document titled: ‘The Plan (Abridged)’, which highlighted the programmes expected to be executed by Osinbajo in agriculture, insecurity, manufacturing, governance reforms, investment in people, infrastructure, foreign policy, among others. “Yemi Osinbajo will promote inclusion in decision making, allocation of opportunities and participation; promote equity in the allocation of state resources; adopt and propagate a national ethos that projects the Nigerian spirit and a body of similar attitudes and positive cultural values beneficial to the nation,” the document reads in part. “Yemi Osinbajo will continue to invest in building the capacity of our security forces and win the battle against banditry, terrorism, extremism, kidnapping and other anarchical enterprises. “Yemi Osinbajo will enact a modern and relevant security architecture and framework that prioritises and addresses Nigeria’s current security realities; address both human and material resources constraints of the Nigerian military and police force; address the farmer-pastoralist conflict through the continued and full implementation of the National Livestock Transformational Plan. “Yemi Osinbajo will focus on: supporting young people to acquire relevant skills; building infrastructure to support the prioritised sectors; creating a supportive business environment; and where necessary, provide or facilitate financing for businesses and young people to thrive in entrepreneurship; promoting integrated rural development.”
