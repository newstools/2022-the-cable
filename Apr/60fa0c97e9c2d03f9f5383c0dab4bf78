President Muhammadu Buhari on Friday met with Biodun Oyebanji, the All Progressives Congress (APC) candidate for the Ekiti governorship election. The APC flagbearer for the June 18 election visited the president in the company of Kayode Fayemi, Ekiti governor; Abdullahi Adamu, national chairman of the APC; and Iyiola Omisore, national secretary of the party. According to a statement issued by Femi Adesina, presidential spokesman, Buhari described Oyebanji’s candidature as “continuity of service”. “You have served Ekiti state in many capacities, including as chief of staff, commissioner, and secretary to the state government. Being governor will just be continuity of service. I honestly wish you the best of luck,” he said. Speaking with state house correspondents after the meeting, Oyebanji said his goal is to foster prosperity in Ekiti and continue with the project of the Fayemi administration. He said: “We are confident of victory. Because we are sure that if performance is a yardstick for electoral success, we have nothing to fear.” Here are photos from the meeting. <img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-692811" src="https://f5p3e9e4.stackpathcdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/Ekiti-APC.png" alt="" width="700" height="828" /> <img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-692813" src="https://f5p3e9e4.stackpathcdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/Ekiti-APC1.png" alt="" width="700" height="826" /> <img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-692814" src="https://f5p3e9e4.stackpathcdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/Ekiti-APC2.png" alt="" width="700" height="816" /> <img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-692819" src="https://f5p3e9e4.stackpathcdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/Ekiti-APC3.png" alt="" width="700" height="741" />
