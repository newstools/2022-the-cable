The Plateau chapter of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) has zoned its governorship ticket to the central senatorial district. John Akans, PDP publicity secretary in the state, disclosed this in a communique issued on Saturday. Akans said the decision was taken on Saturday at the 85th meeting of the state executive committee (SEC) held in Jos, the capital of Plateau. “As regards the preparation for the forthcoming general elections in 2023, SEC unanimously approves the zoning of governorship seat to Plateau Central Senatorial District,” the communique reads. “SEC commends the efforts of the state leadership of the party and other various organs of our great party; the Caucus, National Assembly members, elders’ forum, and the structure of the party at the ward, local government, and zonal levels. “It commends the commitment of the State Working Committee (SWC), under the chairmanship of Mr Christopher Hassan, for uniting and repositioning the PDP ahead of the 2023 general elections. “SEC also commends members of the party for the victory recorded at the last by-election in Jos North/Bassa Federal Constituency and Pankshin South State Constituency. “Consequently, SEC charges all party members across the state to work hard to ensure victory in 2023 general elections.” Akans added the PDP will address the challenges affecting the state when it assumes power in 2023.
