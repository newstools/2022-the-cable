Magnus Onyibe, the public policy analyst and media columnist, has put out a new book titled ‘Becoming President of Nigeria: A Citizen’s Guide’. Onyibe announced the book release in a statement sent to TheCable and signed by Tervel Kejih on Tuesday. According to him, the 12-chapter book chronicles the evolution of political leadership in Nigeria and outlines the turning points in the nation’s checkered political history. “With keen eyes on the ethnic and religious sensitivities responsible for the mutual suspicion of one another by the multiple ethnic nationalities that make up the country, the author shines light on how Nigeria is practicing zero sum politics via rotation of presidential power between north and south agreement which has inadvertently been undermining the unity of the country and is responsible for lack of real socioeconomic progress even as it is fueling ethno-religious disharmony in Nigeria,” the statement read. Onyibe added that the ultimate mission of the book is “to enlighten citizens on how to become president of Nigeria by highlighting the pre-requisites for ascending the exalted office.” The development strategist said the book became imperative to also enable Nigerians make informed decision at the 2023 general election. Onyibe said the book, published by lnspire media services limited, will be formally launched in Abuja on May 10. The foreword of the book was written by Bolaji Akinyemi, ex-foreign affairs minister and deputy chairman 2014 National Confab. In the foreword, Akindele argued that “Nigeria is not a zero -sum politics where what one gains, the other loses”. He concluded that “it can be a multi-sum politics where structure and gains are shared with equity”.
