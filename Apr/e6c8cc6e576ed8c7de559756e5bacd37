Gunmen have set ablaze the headquarters of Orsu LGA in Imo state, residents have told TheCable. The gunmen were said to have invaded the area around 2:30 am on Sunday. TheCable understands that several buildings, including the LGA chairman’s office, administrative block and parked vehicles, were burnt by the gunmen. Osondu Chinedu, a resident of the area, said: “Orsu is now a no-go-area for the youths, especially young men because of the activities of unknown gunmen who are terrorizing the entire local government area.” Uchenna Osuigwe, the interim chairman of the LGA, who also confirmed the incident said a lot of things were damaged in the fire. “You know there is no way a fire will not damage something but the extent of the damage is being assessed. So in due time, after a fact-finding exercise, we will come up with a comprehensive report on this,” he said. When contacted, Michael Abattam, police spokesperson in the state, said he is yet to get information on the incident. The attack comes two days after gunmen set ablaze the home of Ford Ozumba, commissioner for labour, employment and productivity in Imo state. The attack occurred in the commissioner’s hometown in Umuhu-Okabia community — also in Orsu LGA. In recent months, there’s have been a series of attacks in the state, with President Muhammadu Buhari recently summoning Hope Uzodimma, governor of the state, to the presidential villa.
