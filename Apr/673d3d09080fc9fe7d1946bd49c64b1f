Abubakar Malami, attorney-general of the federation, says he is yet to declare his interest in any elective position come 2023. Malami was reported to have declared his intention to run for the office of Kebbi governor on Monday. “If God in His mercies permits, and all goes well, I will as a politician contest the governorship of Kebbi state. I am seeking your support,” THISDAY quoted him as saying. “I want to announce that I will contest indeed and as such, I am counting on your prayers and support so that we can all work and survive the race together. “I have no history of betrayal and I won’t betray you, people. I will work for you.” However, hours after the report, the minister of justice, in a statement issued by Umar Gwandu, his spokesperson, said he was quoted out of context. “The clarification became necessary in view of a false and fabricated publication in some section of the media,” he said. “The declaration to contest for a political position was never a hidden affair or clandestine operation that could be reported as a scoop by a section of the media.” He said the report was triggered out of curiosity and eagerness by followers and loyalists. “A video being circulated as the purported declaration was mischievously translated with fabricated insertions and interpolations that cannot in spirit and context establish the malinformation circulated,” he added. The minister, however, thanked his campaigners and the general public for expressing their support. “At the appropriate time they will hear from the horse’s mouth in full glare of the media, stakeholders, like-minds, party faithful and teaming supporters,” Gwandu added.
