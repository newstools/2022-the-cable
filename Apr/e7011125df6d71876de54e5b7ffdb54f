The Imo state government, on Tuesday, conducted mass burial for victims of the recent explosion that occurred at an illegal oil refinery in Agbaezi, Ohaji-Egbema LGA of Imo state. Over 100 persons were reported to have died in the incident, while five vehicles were razed. The victims’ remains were buried in three graves dug at the site of the explosion. Representing the state government, Marcel Amadioha, the interim management committee chairman of Ohaji-Egbema LGA, said mass burial was conducted since many victims were unable to be identified by their family members. “We have the instruction of the governor of Imo state, senator Hope Uzodimma, to conduct a mass burial for the victims of the explosion. This is the least we can do for them because they were burnt beyond recognition. You can see there are no relatives of the victims who are here. This is because the victims were unidentifiable. This is the least we could do to avoid their bodies from decaying further,” he said. “I believe this will serve as a deterrent to others. We are clamping down on all illegal refineries in this area. We can’t allow this economic sabotage to continue. We deserve better than this. The governor has shown enough compassion by providing us with enough logistics to carry out this mass burial.” Ben Marcos, the area youth leader, revealed that its community is currently carrying out a sensitisation programme to educate youths about the dangers of oil bunkering. Meanwhile, environmental health officials of Ohaji-Egbema LGA have carried out a fumigation exercise to forestall disease outbreak in the area.
