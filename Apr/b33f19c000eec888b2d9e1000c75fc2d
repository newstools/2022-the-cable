The federal government says it is investing N19.9 billion for the construction of 2,754 houses for low-income earners in six states. According to the Family Homes Funds Limited (FHFL), the houses will be constructed in Akwa Ibom (650 units), Enugu (250 units), Kebbi (620 units), Zamfara (600 units), Kano (500 units) and Kaduna (134 units). The houses — two and three-bedroom semi-detached apartments — are expected to be completed in April 2023. In a statement on Friday, Femi Adewole, FHFL managing director, said the programme is being implemented under the national mass housing scheme. “This programme is being implemented under the National Mass Housing Programme, an initiative of the administration of His Excellency President Muhammadu Buhari, as part of the administration’s commitment to improving the quality of life of Nigerians on low income and creating much needed jobs for local people,” Adewole said. “We are delighted to be collaborating with state governments and private developers to help 2,754 families own their homes at a price they can afford. We continue to seek partnership with other State Governments to ensure equitable spread of the programme. “We are particularly excited about the opportunity for collaboration with the Adashe Women Housing Society in Kaduna. “Unfortunately, women continue to experience significant barriers to accessing housing on their own. In many of our cities, landlords will often refuse to rent a home to a woman without a husband. “Even worse, it is still a common occurrence for women to be forced to leave the family home with their children if their husband dies because their names are not on the title or lease documents.” The FHFL MD added that the houses, upon completion, would be sold to low-income families at a payment plan spread over a period of up to 15 years, with monthly payments of N25,000.
