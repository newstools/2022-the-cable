A federal high court in Abuja has sacked Yakubu Dogara from the house of representatives over his defection to the All Progressives Congress (APC). Dogara, who represents Bogoro/Dass federal constituency of Bauchi state, was the speaker of the house of representatives between 2015 and 2019. In July 2020, he defected from the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) to the APC, and said his decision was based on the “failure of governance” in Bauchi. Following his defection, two different suits were instituted in court against him. The first suit marked: FHC/ABJ/CS/883/30 was filed by the Incorporated Trustees of United Global Resources for Peace Organisation, while the second suit marked: FHC/ABJ/CS/1060/20 was filed by the PDP. Danatus Okorowo, the presiding judge of the federal high court, Okorowo had dismissed the first suit on the grounds that the group lacked a locus standi to institute the matter. Delivering judgment on the second suit on Friday, Okorowo held that  Dogara’s defection from the PDP which sponsored his election was wrong. The judge also ordered the lawmaker to vacate his seat. The development comes after a similar judgment on March 8 by Inyang Ekwo, judge of a federal high court, which sacked David Umahi, Ebonyi governor, and his deputy, Kelechi Igwe, alongside 16 lawmakers over their defection from the PDP to APC. Also, on March 21, Taiwo Taiwo, another federal high court judge, ordered 20 lawmakers from Cross River to vacate their seats following their defection from the PDP to APC. The lawmakers from Cross River comprised two members of the house of representatives and 18 state house of assembly members.
