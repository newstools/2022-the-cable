Ibrahim Almustapha, a member of the house of representatives, says the security challenges confronting the country are signs of Nigeria’s greatness. Speaking with NAN on Sunday, Almustapha, who represents Wurno/Rabah federal constituency in Sokoto, said many countries passed through challenges before they became great. Almustapha said Nigeria would turn out great if it could overcome its challenges. “To me, I see most of these challenges, especially the security challenges facing the country, as a sign of greatness. Many great nations passed through lots of challenges on their way to greatness,” he said. “I believe the same situation is applicable to Nigeria and once we are able to overcome them, Nigeria will certainly become great in every aspect of human endeavours — in terms of economy, infrastructure, power and all others. “What we need is to come together as a nation with sincerity, towards tackling the challenges. Nigerians who are fond of celebrating bad news and negativity should stop. “Those supplying information and logistics to bandits and armed robbers should stop and those entrusted with the task of fighting them should be more sincere.” Almustapha said the APC has performed better than the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) since it took over power in 2015. “I think the APC has performed very well especially when compared with the PDP years,” he said. “I can comfortably tell you that the APC will win the 2023 general election with landslide victory.”
