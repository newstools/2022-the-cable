Olasupo Akinola, a 40-year-old Ibadan-based Islamic cleric, has declared his interest to contest for the 2023 presidential election on the platform of the All Progressives Congress (APC). Akinola declared his intention, on Monday, while addressing APC members at Community Primary School, Olomi-Academy, Ibadan, Oyo state. The Islamic cleric was quoted by The Nation to have said God directed him to contest for the presidency, saying Nigerians are currently living in abject poverty. He promised to make Nigeria better for the poor citizens while calling on past leaders to support his ambition. He added that the country is in serious trouble, saying God sent him to proffer solutions to the country’s problems. The Islamic cleric will challenge APC presidential hopefuls like Bola Tinubu, former Lagos governor; Vice-President Yemi Osinbajo; David Umahi, governor of Ebonyi; Chris Ngige, minister of labour; Yahaya Bello, governor of Kogi; Rotimi Amaechi, minister of transportation, among others, for the party’s ticket. The APC has fixed May 30/31 as the date for its presidential primary election. With months to the 2023 elections, politicians are currently canvassing for support for their political ambitions.
