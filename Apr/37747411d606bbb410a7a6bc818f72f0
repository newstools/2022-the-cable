Ayodele Fayose, former governor of Ekiti, has withdrawn his membership of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) zoning committee for the 2023 general election. Fayose disclosed his intention in a letter dated April 5 and addressed to Samuel Ortom, governor of Benue and chairman of the zoning committee. In the letter, Fayose cited his ambition to contest the presidency in 2023 as reason for his withdrawal from the committee. “I write to formally appreciate the party and all members of this committee. I thank you all for your statesmanship, selflessness and sense of patriotism to our party and, by extension, our nation in the way you have all handled and comported yourselves so far in deliberations regarding this delicate and sensitive issue/assignment, the zoning of public offices, particularly that of the president,” the letter reads. “I pray the outcome will bring understanding, peace and stability to our party and our country at large. “Having hinted during our last meeting of my intention to run for the office of the president in the coming primary election and by God’s grace, the general election, it will not be morally right to continue to participate in the zoning debate being an aspirant myself. “Therefore, my state has nominated the bearer of this letter, Dr. Gbenga Faseluka, to replace me.”
