Rainfall, which began on Monday, has resulted in flooding across communities in Kwazulu-Natal province of South Africa. As of Wednesday, Sipho Hlomuka, cooperative governance and traditional affairs minister, was quoted as saying the death toll arising from the flood had risen to 259. Described by the KwaZulu-Natal provincial government as “one of the worst weather storms” in the history of the country, efforts are ongoing to provide relief for displaced persons. During a visit to the community on Wednesday, President Cyril Ramaphosa called on communities to partner with government on ensuring that response is effective. “This is a tragic toll of the force of nature and this situation calls for an effective response by government in partnership with communities,” he said. “This situation calls on us to come together as a nation and offer assistance to those who desperately need our care and support.” Speaking after a visit to affected communities alongside the president, Kgosientsho Ramokgopa, head of infrastructure South Africa, described the effect of the weather incident as “massive”. “This morning, I joined President Cyril Ramaphosa as he inspected the damaged infrastructure in Kwa-Zulu Natal. The devastation caused by the floods is massive, and we certainly have a mammoth task ahead,” Ramokgopa said in a statement. “Our teams are already on the ground, formulating immediate solutions to restore and rebuild the damaged infrastructure, so that essential services in affected communities can be restored as soon as possible. “My deepest and most sincere condolences to the families who have lost loved ones.”
