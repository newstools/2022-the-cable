Nasiru Gawuna, deputy governor of Kano, has resigned from his position as the state’s commissioner for agriculture and natural resources. Gawuna, in a statement signed by Hassan Fagge, his spokesperson, on Monday, said the resignation is to enable him further his political career. “Praise be to almighty Allah for giving me the strength and wisdom and also guiding me to steer the ministry of agriculture and natural resources for the past seven years under our amiable governor, Dr Abdullahi Umar Ganduje,” the statement reads. “Through these years, I served as the commissioner of agriculture under the proactive leadership of Governor Abdullahi Ganduje. I garnered a lot of knowledge, broadened my perspective and acquired experience in the service of the people. “In those years, we worked with vision and recorded a lot of achievements in the agricultural sector. “I appreciate the opportunity given to me twice to serve as commissioner under the purposeful Ganduje administration which today made me among the longest serving commissioners of agriculture in the country. “My decision to resign as commissioner for agriculture and natural resources is to further my political career. “I will continue to give contributions towards the development of the state as your loyal deputy in the mandate given to us by Kano people.” Also, Aminu Tsanyawa, the state commissioner for health, resigned his position to contest the house of representatives from Kunchi/Tsanyawa constituency seat in the state. Ali Makoda, chief of staff to the governor, also resigned. Others who tendered their resignation included Kabiru Lakwaya, the state commissioner for youth and sports; and Muhammad Maikasuwa, special adviser to the governor on youth enlightenment. The resignation comes amid controversy over section 84(12) of the Electoral Act 2022, which mandates political appointees seeking election to resign their positions before participating in party primaries.
