Dakuku Peterside, former director-general of the Nigerian Maritime Administration and Safety Agency (NIMASA), has urged the people of Rivers to vote out the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) in 2023. According to a statement by his media team, the former NIMASA DG spoke on Saturday at a special thanksgiving service held in Port Harcourt, the Rivers capital, “to thank God for successful convention and congresses” of the All Progressives Congress (APC). Peterside expressed sadness over what he described as the “directionless” state of affairs in Rivers and urged Nigerians to support the APC to win the presidential, governorship and other elective positions in the general election. “You all have seen the mammoth crowd here which points to a new height in APC’s renewed movement towards ending the breast-pocket governance Rivers people found themselves in since 2015,” he was quoted as saying. “Our people have suffered enough in the hands of Wike and PDP, but APC is set to end all of that and reset the state to achieving her full potential. That PDP must go in 2023 is our resolve, and working in harmony, we shall achieve that. “Today is a statement in the party’s resolve to terminate the directionless regime of Wike and his PDP and in turn entrench good governance and grow our beloved state. “The agitation is everywhere across the state for freedom from the current administration of Governor Nyesom Wike, which is the lowest for the state since its creation on May 27, 1967. “Every Rivers’ citizen, including civil servants, traders, craftsmen, students and our statesmen are tired of Wike and PDP and are in unison to see their end. “APC in the state is ready to mobilise them, going forward, to serve this wicked government the red card it well deserves.”
