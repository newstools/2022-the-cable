Some members of the Deeper Life Bible Church located at Iragbo community in Badagry, Lagos state, were injured on Sunday when the church building collapsed. According to NAN, there was heavy rain during which the church building collapsed around 9:30am while service was in progress. No fatality was recorded in the incident. Topohozin Tunde, a member of the church, said six members of the church sustained serious injuries. “I also sustained a serious knee injury, but thank God no life was lost,” he said. “Around 9:30 this morning, during the church service, there was a heavy storm which hit the church building, and before we knew what was happening, the whole church building collapsed. “Some were able to escape, while about six of us sustained serious injuries. “Those that were seriously injured were taken to the General Hospital in Badagry for proper attention. “Since my injury was not much, I decided to take care of myself.” Tunde, however, alleged that although the injured persons got medical attention, they were not treated properly because “there was no medical doctor available at the hospital” at the time of the incident. Also speaking on the incident, Thoma Agodi, the Baale of Iragbo community, said he was inside his palace when a resident came to inform him that the church building had collapsed. “We have to thank God that there was no fatality as a result of the collapse,” he added.
