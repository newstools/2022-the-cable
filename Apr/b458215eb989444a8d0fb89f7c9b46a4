The All Progressives Congress (APC) has defended the cost of the nomination forms for its public offices. On Wednesday, the party released its primary election timetable ahead of the 2023 elections, after a meeting of its national executive committee (NEC). The party also announced the fees for the nomination forms — presidential hopefuls are expected to pay N100 million, while those for governorship will pay N50 million. The price of nomination form for state house of assembly was pegged at N2 million, house of representatives is N10 million, and that for the senate is N20 million. The cost of the nomination forms has elicited varied reactions on social media platforms, with some persons describing the fees as “exorbitant” in the light of current economic realities. Speaking on Wednesday in an interview with Channels Television, Frank Morka, APC spokesperson, said the decision on the form fees was “justified”. “I get that people may have legitimate questions around that (referring to the cost of nomination form). Don’t forget at the same time some of the most special groups of citizens were granted high consideration either in delivering nomination forms to them for free as in the case of women and people living with disabilities,” he said. “Youths who are between ages 25 to 40 were granted 50 percent discount. The party advised the party on the price tags. What is the present situation in the country? We still live in a country where people live very opulent lifestyles, make legitimate money. “APC isn’t for the rich. Things are not perfect economically. They are not perfect anywhere. The party made a decision that the value put on these forms are justified.”
