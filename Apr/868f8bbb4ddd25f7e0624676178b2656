A federal high court in Abuja has fixed April 29 for the re-arraignment of Precious Chikwendu, the estranged wife of Femi Fani-Kayode, on allegations bordering on attempted murder. Chikwendu alongside three others were initially arraigned on February 14 on a 13-count charge. She is accused of attempting to stab Fani-Kayode with a kitchen knife on November 24, 2018. In the case marked FHCABJ/CR/1/2022, the defendants were alleged to have committed offences bordering on cybercrime, intimidation to kill Fani-Kayode, threat to kill one Lauretta in order to cause her to leave her relationship with the former minister. They were also accused of criminally using the internet to send abusive communications to Fani-Kayode, fabricating false evidence by deposing to a series of affidavits alleging that he physically and sexually assaulted members of his domestic staff, and having the affidavits published in a national daily. At the court session on Wednesday, John Ijagbemi, prosecution counsel, applied for the amended 14-count charge to be read to the defendants for them to take their plea. However, the judge said that the re-arraignment would not go on as scheduled. He subsequently adjourned the case until April 29 for re-arraignment. Meanwhile, Chikwendu is also answering charges of defamation brought against her by Grace Bent, the former senator. Chikwendu had claimed that Bent was after her life, alleging that she was in cahoots with Fani-Kayode to deny her custody of her children. But the former lawmaker had dismissed the claim and threatened to take legal action against her. Fani-Kayode and Chikwendu’s marriage hit the rocks in 2020 over her domestic violence claim and his counter-claim of infidelity. They have been in a heated tussle for the custody of their children — Aragorn, Ragnar, Aiden, and Liam — since the marriage crashed.
