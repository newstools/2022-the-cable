An unconfirmed number of people have been reportedly killed in an attack by gunmen on a community in Orlu LGA of Imo state. The gunmen reportedly invaded the LGA on Sunday afternoon and opened fire on civilians before being confronted by security operatives. Several people were reportedly injured in the attack, which also resulted in the destruction buildings. Mike Abattem, police spokesperson in Imo, is yet to respond to calls to confirm the attack. In recent months, the state has been the target of multiple attacks by gunmen. The development comes days after an official of the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) was shot dead in Ihitte Uboma LGA of the state. Two other INEC officials were declared missing in the attack which occurred last Thursday. But they were later found. As a result of the development, the commission suspended the continuous voter registration (CVR) exercise in the LGA.
