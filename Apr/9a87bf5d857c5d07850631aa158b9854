Nuru Khalid, the suspended chief Imam of Apo legislative quarters mosque, has aired his mind following the sanction meted out to him. TheCable had reported that Khalid was suspended from his position in the mosque after his sermon during Friday’s Jummat service. The cleric had flayed the government for its inadequacy in dealing with the security situation in the country amid a high number of attacks by non-state actors. Khalid asked the electorate not to vote for any politician who cannot guarantee them the safety of lives and properties. “The condition of the Nigerian masses is one, stop killing us, go to the polls, let us be killed, we will not go to the polls, since you have nothing to do but vote,” Khalid had said. Consequently, the mosque committee headed by Saidu Muhammed Dansadau sanctioned the cleric, describing his teachings of political apathy as un-Islamic while urging the electorate to “go to the polls to eliminate those who oppose God, the electorate and the country”. Khalid reacted to the suspension via a tweet posted on his official Twitter account on Sunday. The cleric said God is the owner of power and dictates whom he gives. “O God! the master of sovereignty, you give sovereignty to whom you please, and seize sovereignty from whom you please, you honour whom you please and you abase whom you please, all good is in your hands, indeed you have power over all things,” Khalid tweeted in Arabic.
