Kasi Cloud, a Nigerian data centre company, has commenced the construction of a “Tier IV” data centre worth $250 million in Lagos. The $250 million data centre campus in Lekki is said to be modelled similar to Silicon Valley technology parks. Upon completion, it is expected to be one of the biggest of its kind in Africa. Babajide Sanwo-Olu, governor of Lagos, was the special guest of honour at the groundbreaking ceremony held recently in the state. Also in attendance were some of Kasi’s key investors, including Uche Orji, chief executive officer of the Nigerian Sovereign Investment Authority (NSIA). The company said it acquired approximately 4 hectares of land in the Maiyegun area of Lekki, Lagos, where the structure will be located. The data centre in Lekki is designed to “provide space for hyper-scale and enterprise businesses, offering market-leading scalability and connectivity”. Speaking on the development, Johnson Agogbua, the company’s co-founder and CEO, said, “Kasi’s mission of building a digital platform to accelerate cloud and interconnect people, enterprises and governmental institutions in Nigeria and across Africa started here in Lagos, Nigeria”. “We are excited to have both the Governor of Lagos State, His Excellency Babajide Sanwo-Olu and NSIA CEO, Uche Orji, to celebrate this momentous ground breaking with us and the community.” In his remarks, Orji said the NSIA believes in the potential of digital infrastructure to serve as an enabler and accelerator for innovation. He said the agency is expectant that the transformative impact of the infrastructure on the domestic tech space will reposition Nigeria. “The Board and Management of the Authority is proud to be associated with this development,” he added.
