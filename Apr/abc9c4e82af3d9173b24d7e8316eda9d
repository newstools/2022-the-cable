Manchester City scored twice in both halves to outscore Real Madrid 4-3 in the first leg encounter of their UEFA Champions League (UCL) semi-final tie at the Etihad Stadium on Tuesday night. Kevin De Bruyne led the English Premier League champions with the opener before excellent strikes from Gabriel Jesus, Phil Foden and Bernardo Silva respectively gave Man City a healthy first-leg lead despite equally impressive goals from Karim Benzema (brace) and Vinicius Jr. City were first out of the traps and scored twice in the first 15 minutes, with De Bruyne providing a diving header to Riyad Mahrez’s perfect cross on two minutes before Jesus seized on another slack defending from Real Madrid to slot beyond Thibaut Courtois for 2-0 on 11 minutes. The English champions couldn’t capitalize on two clear-cut chances to further extend the lead as Real Madrid showed character to half the deficit through Benzema. The on-form 34-year-old striker pounced on a half chance to slot into the far post for 2-1 at halftime. Pep Guardiola’s side continued to attack after the restart of the second half and was rewarded with a third goal, with Foden dispatching Fernandinho’s inch-perfect cross for 3-1 on 53 minutes. Real Madrid, again, responded two minutes later via Vinicius Jr.’s wonder goal. Bernardo Silva responded for Man City with an emphatic shot into the top corner as Benzema responded with an exquisite panenka penalty following a handball to score his 14th UCL goal of the season. The electric game wound down towards the end and Man City held on to their lead to take a one-goal advantage into the second leg that takes place in Spain on Wednesday, May 4.
