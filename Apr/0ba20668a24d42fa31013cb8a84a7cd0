Chukwuma Soludo, governor of Anambra, has urged Bayern Munich FC of Germany to consider establishing a football academy in the state. According to NAN, Soludo made the request on Saturday while welcoming the club’s contingent into the state for the Bayern Munich National Youth Cup Nigeria. The governor, who was represented by Tony Oli, chairman of the Anambra Sports Development Commission, urged the club to state the requirements for bringing the idea to fruition. “Anambra has a rich history in football, we have the talent and we have the facility, so we are calling on Bayern Munich to consider establishing an academy here in Anambra, because we will like to continue to have you,” he said “Just tell us what will be required and we will put them on ground.” On his part, Obinna Edeh, proprietor of VOE Foundation and representative partner of Bayern Munich in Nigeria, said no fewer than 100 budding talents in the age range of 15 to 16 across the country were selected for the tourney. He said 10 players from the event would be sent abroad in October later this year, and would be nurtured by the Bundesliga side and mentored to stardom. The Bayern Youth Cup technical team is headed by Hans Pflugler, a retired Germany player and member of the 1990 World Cup-winning team.
