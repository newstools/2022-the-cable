Chelsea scored four first half goals to breeze past poor Southampton for a 6-0 win in their English Premier League (EPL) fixture at St. Mary’s Stadium on Saturday. Goals from Marcos Alonso, Kai Havertz and braces from Mason Mount and Timo Werner helped Chelsea to secure a win while consigning Southampton to a sixth league match without victory. Thomas Tuchel’s side dominated from the first whistle and took a deserved lead on seven minutes through Alonso’s well struck low shot. Mount turned from provider to scorer, as he found the bottom corner to double the visitors’ advantage. Werner and Havertz both tapped into an empty net to give Chelsea a four-goal lead at the interval. The Blues continued from where they left off with Werner again tapping into an empty net before Mount also got his second goal. Chelsea remain third on the EPL table with 62 points from 30 matches. Earlier in the day, Everton stunned hapless Manchester United 1-0 to ease their relegation troubles, with Anthony Gordon’s deflected strike on 27 minutes proving enough to give the Toffees a four-point gap above the relegation spots on the EPL table. Man United’s defeat continued a poor run of one win in five league matches, as the Red Devils are marooned in seventh position with 51 points from 31 matches as they suffered a defeat that further dented their top-four ambition.
