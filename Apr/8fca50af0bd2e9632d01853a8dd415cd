Lipton is the biggest tea brand in the world, with a presence in over 110 countries.With an inspiring heritage, Lipton has grown into a loved, purposeful and social brand that creates moments to uplift people’s bodies, minds, and spirits.The mission for the brand is to awaken the world to quality connections and fight hidden loneliness much of which can start over a cup of Lipton Tea. The partnership with Mrs Betty Irabor is one of the sustainable ways Lipton supports women. In 2018, Lipton partnered with the Hope for Life initiative to support 1,000 widows, driving awareness of the need to remember socially disadvantaged women in society. Last year, Lipton partnered with Femme Africa for an “Only” “female performer concert. This year, in celebration of International Women’s Day, with campaign theme “Break the Bias”, the brand went further to acknowledge biases as it relates to mental health. This led to a #LiptonBreakTheBias campaign for the entire month of March. <img class="alignnone wp-image-685960" src="https://f5p3e9e4.stackpathcdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/Betty-Irabor-scaled.jpg" alt="" width="550" height="367" srcset="https://f5p3e9e4.stackpathcdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/Betty-Irabor-scaled.jpg 2560w, https://f5p3e9e4.stackpathcdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/Betty-Irabor-300x200.jpg 300w, https://f5p3e9e4.stackpathcdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/Betty-Irabor-1024x683.jpg 1024w, https://f5p3e9e4.stackpathcdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/Betty-Irabor-768x512.jpg 768w, https://f5p3e9e4.stackpathcdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/Betty-Irabor-1536x1024.jpg 1536w, https://f5p3e9e4.stackpathcdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/Betty-Irabor-2048x1365.jpg 2048w, https://f5p3e9e4.stackpathcdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/Betty-Irabor-24x16.jpg 24w, https://f5p3e9e4.stackpathcdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/Betty-Irabor-36x24.jpg 36w, https://f5p3e9e4.stackpathcdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/Betty-Irabor-48x32.jpg 48w" sizes="(max-width: 550px) 100vw, 550px" /> Gleaning from Mrs. Betty Irabor’s life story and achievements relating to mental health, it was pertinent for the brand to partner with this icon. It became absolutely important to shed light on how years and years of subtle and unconscious bias can tell on our mental health and how the stigma of talking about mental health in itself is a BIAS WE HAVE TO BREAK!! During the course of the campaign, Lipton Nigeria and Mrs Betty Irabor released videos within the month of March encouraging women to take breaks and prioritize their mental wellbeing. On Thursday, March 31st, Lipton hosted the ‘Ultimate Conversation with Betty Irabor in partnership with GoSlo’. This event took place at the Wheatbaker Ikoyi. The goal of this event was to create a safe space for women to have candid conversations to take stock of their current mental health and gain valuable advice on how to improve it. GoSlo’s contribution to mental health leans on providing an escape for young Nigerians from life’s difficult phases. Part of the brand’s call to action is ‘taste life slo’ i.e. take out time from your busy schedule to enjoy life or create little joyful moments and celebrate small wins. GoSlo tends to achieve this through partnerships that drive conversations around mental health. Given Lipton & GoSlo’s acknowledgment of mental health, It was a natural for these brands to work out bringing to life a safe space for women to share, learn and express their experiences with mental health along the lines of biases. <img class="alignnone wp-image-686120" src="https://f5p3e9e4.stackpathcdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/Screen-Shot-2022-04-11-at-6.11.41-PM.png" alt="" width="550" height="366" srcset="https://f5p3e9e4.stackpathcdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/Screen-Shot-2022-04-11-at-6.11.41-PM.png 1017w, https://f5p3e9e4.stackpathcdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/Screen-Shot-2022-04-11-at-6.11.41-PM-300x200.png 300w, https://f5p3e9e4.stackpathcdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/Screen-Shot-2022-04-11-at-6.11.41-PM-768x511.png 768w, https://f5p3e9e4.stackpathcdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/Screen-Shot-2022-04-11-at-6.11.41-PM-24x16.png 24w, https://f5p3e9e4.stackpathcdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/Screen-Shot-2022-04-11-at-6.11.41-PM-36x24.png 36w, https://f5p3e9e4.stackpathcdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/Screen-Shot-2022-04-11-at-6.11.41-PM-48x32.png 48w" sizes="(max-width: 550px) 100vw, 550px" /> The event was intimate and filled with candid conversations between Mrs Irabor and guests in attendance.

She said “In March, we partnered with the legendary Mrs. Irabor to share her journey of breaking through stereotypes and taking charge of her mental health as she built her career and family over the years. We also teamed up with the Lipton brand influencer Taymesam Emmanuel to support some female SME’s with a grant of 200,000 Naira. My life has personally been changed by listening to Mrs. Irabor’s story , her nuggets, and some of her tips on identifying triggers. I sincerely hope that you have found it helpful and that you can refer to some of the videos when necessary. Today we wrap up. We are here to unwind with authentic conversations, make quality connections and have some Lipton Extra Strong. My charge is to have fun, smile, take pictures , be present in the moment, and please spill the tea on your social media pages #LiptonConversationswithBettyIrabor. #LiptonBreakTheBias.” <img class="alignnone wp-image-685950" src="https://f5p3e9e4.stackpathcdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/Screen-Shot-2022-04-11-at-11.59.59-AM.png" alt="" width="550" height="840" srcset="https://f5p3e9e4.stackpathcdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/Screen-Shot-2022-04-11-at-11.59.59-AM.png 446w, https://f5p3e9e4.stackpathcdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/Screen-Shot-2022-04-11-at-11.59.59-AM-196x300.png 196w, https://f5p3e9e4.stackpathcdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/Screen-Shot-2022-04-11-at-11.59.59-AM-16x24.png 16w, https://f5p3e9e4.stackpathcdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/Screen-Shot-2022-04-11-at-11.59.59-AM-24x36.png 24w, https://f5p3e9e4.stackpathcdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/Screen-Shot-2022-04-11-at-11.59.59-AM-31x48.png 31w" sizes="(max-width: 550px) 100vw, 550px" /> Toyosi Etim-Effiong, Adenike Oyetunde, Simi Drey and Kaylah Oniwo This event also showcased five women who won Lipton’s 1 Million Naira grant for Female entrepreneurs, in partnership with Brand influencer Taymesan.

Zainab admonished the women with these words:“Today, we are delighted as a social brand to have this moment where we uplift and celebrate women around us. Everything we’ve done this month is out of the desire to sustain our connections and drive awareness to the impact of women in our society. It brings us great joy to have this become a reality and to be in the presence of such women this evening.” Zainab Abbas (Brand Manager, Ekaterra – Lipton), Bella Oluoha (Bella Books), Taymesan Rounding up the event, Jennifer Balogun (Marketing Manager FanMilk – Danone) expressed that ‘We are here today as part of the GoSlo moments with Betty Irabor partnering with Lipton to essentially just have conversations as women. It is the last day of International Women’s Day and we are also having the opportunity to celebrate Aunty Betty. For us as the GoSlo brand I think it is a very apt opportunity when we think about ourselves as women and as men in Nigeria I think our focus is very much on our hustle and never about the reward and the opportunity to take life slow.’’ Karen Shokunbi (Dessert Haven), Bella Oluoha (Bella Books), Zainab Abbas(Brand Manager, Ekaterra – Lipton) Taymesan Emmanuel, Motunrayo Babalola (Marketing Lead – Ekattera (Lipton), Boluwatife Folarin(Koree Official), Chioma Ukpabi (ShopkhadSole) and Jennifer Aludogbu (Representing Rakeb Packaging <img class="alignnone wp-image-686122" src="https://f5p3e9e4.stackpathcdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/IMG_2783-scaled.jpg" alt="" width="550" height="825" srcset="https://f5p3e9e4.stackpathcdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/IMG_2783-scaled.jpg 1707w, https://f5p3e9e4.stackpathcdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/IMG_2783-200x300.jpg 200w, https://f5p3e9e4.stackpathcdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/IMG_2783-683x1024.jpg 683w, https://f5p3e9e4.stackpathcdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/IMG_2783-768x1152.jpg 768w, https://f5p3e9e4.stackpathcdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/IMG_2783-1024x1536.jpg 1024w, https://f5p3e9e4.stackpathcdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/IMG_2783-1365x2048.jpg 1365w, https://f5p3e9e4.stackpathcdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/IMG_2783-16x24.jpg 16w, https://f5p3e9e4.stackpathcdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/IMG_2783-24x36.jpg 24w, https://f5p3e9e4.stackpathcdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/IMG_2783-32x48.jpg 32w" sizes="(max-width: 550px) 100vw, 550px" /> Powede Awujo <img class="alignnone wp-image-685958" src="https://f5p3e9e4.stackpathcdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/Screen-Shot-2022-04-11-at-11.55.44-AM.png" alt="" width="550" height="367" srcset="https://f5p3e9e4.stackpathcdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/Screen-Shot-2022-04-11-at-11.55.44-AM.png 1019w, https://f5p3e9e4.stackpathcdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/Screen-Shot-2022-04-11-at-11.55.44-AM-300x200.png 300w, https://f5p3e9e4.stackpathcdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/Screen-Shot-2022-04-11-at-11.55.44-AM-768x513.png 768w, https://f5p3e9e4.stackpathcdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/Screen-Shot-2022-04-11-at-11.55.44-AM-24x16.png 24w, https://f5p3e9e4.stackpathcdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/Screen-Shot-2022-04-11-at-11.55.44-AM-36x24.png 36w, https://f5p3e9e4.stackpathcdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/Screen-Shot-2022-04-11-at-11.55.44-AM-48x32.png 48w" sizes="(max-width: 550px) 100vw, 550px" /> <img class="alignnone wp-image-685957" src="https://f5p3e9e4.stackpathcdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/Screen-Shot-2022-04-11-at-11.56.09-AM.png" alt="" width="550" height="366" srcset="https://f5p3e9e4.stackpathcdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/Screen-Shot-2022-04-11-at-11.56.09-AM.png 1020w, https://f5p3e9e4.stackpathcdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/Screen-Shot-2022-04-11-at-11.56.09-AM-300x200.png 300w, https://f5p3e9e4.stackpathcdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/Screen-Shot-2022-04-11-at-11.56.09-AM-768x511.png 768w, https://f5p3e9e4.stackpathcdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/Screen-Shot-2022-04-11-at-11.56.09-AM-24x16.png 24w, https://f5p3e9e4.stackpathcdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/Screen-Shot-2022-04-11-at-11.56.09-AM-36x24.png 36w, https://f5p3e9e4.stackpathcdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/Screen-Shot-2022-04-11-at-11.56.09-AM-48x32.png 48w" sizes="(max-width: 550px) 100vw, 550px" /> <img class="alignnone wp-image-686119" src="https://f5p3e9e4.stackpathcdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/Screen-Shot-2022-04-11-at-6.12.16-PM.png" alt="" width="550" height="365" srcset="https://f5p3e9e4.stackpathcdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/Screen-Shot-2022-04-11-at-6.12.16-PM.png 1020w, https://f5p3e9e4.stackpathcdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/Screen-Shot-2022-04-11-at-6.12.16-PM-300x199.png 300w, https://f5p3e9e4.stackpathcdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/Screen-Shot-2022-04-11-at-6.12.16-PM-768x509.png 768w, https://f5p3e9e4.stackpathcdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/Screen-Shot-2022-04-11-at-6.12.16-PM-24x16.png 24w, https://f5p3e9e4.stackpathcdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/Screen-Shot-2022-04-11-at-6.12.16-PM-36x24.png 36w, https://f5p3e9e4.stackpathcdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/Screen-Shot-2022-04-11-at-6.12.16-PM-48x32.png 48w" sizes="(max-width: 550px) 100vw, 550px" />  Lipton Nigeria is Social Instagram: @lipton_nigeria Twitter: @liptonng Facebook: @LiptonNigeria Glo Slo Instagram: @goslo_ng
