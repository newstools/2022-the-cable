Airtel Nigeria has signed a memorandum of understanding (MoU) with Konga, an e-commerce company, to deepen the digital retail landscape in the country. The agreement was signed at an event held recently in Ikoyi, Lagos. Speaking during the signing ceremony, Surendran Chemmenkotil, managing director and chief executive officer, Airtel Nigeria, expressed confidence that the alliance would be a win-win for both parties. “Our job is to connect customers, provide the best mobile network, and ensure a great customer experience, but everything else that the customer needs around this is what we look for in alliances and partnerships,” he said. On his part, Godfrey Efeurhobo, chief commercial officer, Airtel Nigeria, said the partnership with Konga was an important step to make online and offline offerings more accessible and affordable for everybody. “This occasion is also significant as it affirms our resolve to make life better, more enjoyable and more fun for our 50m+ customers as we connect them to places, platforms, people, services, offerings and opportunities that can transform their lives,” he said. “At Airtel, we are not only building quality and prestigious network for voice and mobile internet services. “We are also pioneering and inspiring a new wave that will position us as the preferred partner for everything digital, e-commerce, entertainment, lifestyle, productivity, entrepreneurship, sports, etc.” Commenting on the partnership with Airtel, Nick Imudia, chief executive officer of Konga, said consumers of both companies would have access to good quality products and services at unbeatable prices. He, however, didn’t disclose the exact benefits that customers would enjoy. “Unfortunately, we cannot divulge what we’re working on at this time, but if these things come out, it will be quite evident why we are cooperating with Airtel.”
