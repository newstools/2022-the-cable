President Vladimir Putin has signed a decree to introduce visa restrictions for citizens of nations that Russia considers “unfriendly” in response to sanctions over Ukraine. The decree, signed on Monday, will suspend Russia’s simplified visa issuance regime. Putin also ordered the Russian foreign ministry and other bodies to decide on introducing personal entry restrictions on “foreign citizens and stateless people who commit unfriendly actions against Russia, its citizens or its legal entities.” Last month, Russia published a list of countries and territories taking “unfriendly actions” against Russia. The list includes Albania, Andorra, Australia, Great Britain, Jersey, Anguilla, British Virgin Islands, Gibraltar, European Union member states, Iceland, Canada, Liechtenstein, Micronesia, Monaco, New Zealand, Norway, South Korea, San Marino, North Macedonia, Singapore, United States, Taiwan, Ukraine, Montenegro, Switzerland, and Japan. It also decided to subject all corporate deals with companies and individuals from “unfriendly countries” to approval by a government commission. Putin had sent thousands of troops into Ukraine on February 24 in what he called a peace-keeping special operation. His action has been criticised globally. Ukrainian forces have mounted stiff resistance, and the West imposed sweeping sanctions on Russia to force it to withdraw its forces. Many have been reported dead from the war, which has brought significant implications to the world’s economy.
