Bunmi Akinkugbe is the chief executive officer (CEO) of EM Organic, a firm which focuses on the sale and distribution of locally-produced rice. Speaking with TheCable, Bunmi said being in the rice business — EM Organic was established in 2016 — has been interesting, considering the circumstances under which she embraced the trade. Having learned the basics, including identifying rice by colour, shape and size, she said although the rice business comes with competition, her interest was defined from the beginning. “I was very clear about my product; I was never going to sell foreign rice,” she said. Speaking on the effects of the 2019/2020 border closure, she added that it helped to boost sales and also broaden people’s perception about being more receptive to local rice. Bunmi listed challenges to include quality of mills, transportation delays, environmental issues such as the menace of insects and pests, and the general perception about locally-produced rice. She, however, said despite the challenges, she is very interested in the business and is willing to mentor persons who want to learn about rice. Bunmi’s story not only contributes to encouraging business owners on improving the Nigerian economy, it also offers an inspiration for women on determination and standing strong in the face of challenges.
