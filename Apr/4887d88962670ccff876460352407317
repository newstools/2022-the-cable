An African proverb says “death is like a robe everyone has to wear”. The king who had death in his pouch during his 52-year reign has joined his ancestors. Lamidi Olayiwola Atanda Adeyemi III, Alaafin of Oyo, eulogied as ‘Iku Baba Yeye’, (loosely translated as someone who controls death), has journeyed yonder. TheCable learnt the Alaafin had been ill, but later succumbed to his illness The monarch was said to have died at Afe Babalola Teaching Hospital, Ado Ekiti, on Friday night. Adeyemi III was born on October 15, 1938, into the Alowolodu royal family. His father was Adeniran Adeyemi II, who, according to reports, was deposed and sent on exile in 1954 over his alleged support for then National Council of Nigerian Citizens (NCNC). Adeyemi III was crowned on January 14, 1971, spending more than five decades on the throne of his forefathers — which made him one of the longest-serving kings in the history of modern Yoruba traditional rulers. He succeeded Gbadegesin Ladigbolu II as monarch in 1970. HE HAD TRADITIONAL, ISLAMIC AND CHRISTIAN BACKGROUNDS The Alaafin during one of the Eid celebrations Adeyemi III was trained in traditionalism, Islam and Christianity. The monarch did not spend his childhood in the palace with his father. His father made him experience life outside the walls of the palace. In an interview with Oyo Insight, the monarch said his father never wanted him to stay in the palace to avoid being pampered like other princes and princesses. He was sent to Iseyin, a town in Oyo state, by his father for Quranic education. After his Quranic education, he came back to Oyo town and stayed with the headmaster of St Andrews Primary School, where he continued his education. After some years, he was sent to Keffi in Ikoyi area of Lagos state, where he attended Obalende Modern School. He also attended Tinubu Methodist School. For his secondary school education, he attended St Gregory’s College. For his university education, the monarch was to study law abroad, but the plan failed after his father was deposed and sent on exile. APPOINTED AS UNIVERSITY CHANCELLOR Alaafin awarded honourary doctorate by ESPAM- Formation University, Cotonou, Benin Republic In 1980, the monarch was appointed as the pioneer chancellor of the newly-established University of Sokoto, (now known as Uthman Dan Fodio University) for a tenure of four years. At the expiration of his tenure, he was appointed as chancellor for another term of four years. For the third time, he was again appointed as the chancellor. The monarch was the chancellor of the university for 12 years. To appreciate his impact on the university, he was honoured with a doctor of letters (LL.D). He was the chancellor of the University of Maiduguri (UNIMAID), prior to his demise. A BOXER TURNED MONARCH Alaafin during one of his numerous boxing training despite his old age Perhaps Oba Adeyemi III would have dominated the boxing world like the legendary Muhammed Ali, if he was not enthroned as the Alaafin of Oyo. The monarch retired from boxing after he was crowned as the Alaafin of Oyo. According to him, he fought 56 bouts, lost only two and won 44 with knockouts. The monarch said he ventured into boxing because he was “not a very happy person”, so he saw boxing as an avenue to relieve himself of the pain. The Alaafin displays one of the belts he won as a boxer On many occasions, the monarch displayed his boxing skills to the awe of Nigerians. “I am also a good boxer. I have had over 56 bouts and lost two. In my bouts, only 10 (people) who contested with me lasted the distance. I won the others by knockout but I have never been knocked out. Let me tell you a little secret. Inwardly, I am not a very happy person; so, boxing is an interesting outlet for me. When you have a grudge, you don’t feel pain,” the monarch said in an interview. THE CONTROVERSY INVOLVING ALAO-AKALA Akala pays homage to the late Alaafin at his palace The monarch was not free of controversies, especially those relating to politics. He was at loggerheads with the late Christopher Alao-Akala, former governor of Oyo state. The conflict brewed when Alao-Akala installed Ganiyu Abiboye as Baale of Ago-Oja in Oyo town, without the consent of the Alaafin. The installation of Abiboye as Baale of Ago-Oja led to a legal tussle between the Oyo state government and the Alaafin. On several occasions, when the late governor visited locations near the palace of the Alaafin, it was reported that Alao-Akala refused to visit the king to pay homage. The disagreement reached a climax in May 2011, when Alao-Akala introduced a law which stipulated that the office of chairman of council of obas and chiefs in Oyo state will be rotated between the Alaafin and two others kings in the state. Alaafin was the permanent chairman of the council of obas and chiefs in Oyo state. So the move by Alao-Akala was perceived as an attempt to whittle down the influence of the Alaafin in Oyo — and by extension in Yoruba land. A few days to the end of Alao-Akala’s tenure as governor, the Alaafin took Alao-Akala and Ladi Abdulsalam, then state commissioner for justice, to court over their alleged refusal to obey two court orders on the installation of Baale of Ago-Oja. <img class="alignnone wp-image-690404" src="https://f5p3e9e4.stackpathcdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/IMG-20220423-WA0039.jpg" alt="" width="550" height="721" srcset="https://f5p3e9e4.stackpathcdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/IMG-20220423-WA0039.jpg 720w, https://f5p3e9e4.stackpathcdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/IMG-20220423-WA0039-229x300.jpg 229w, https://f5p3e9e4.stackpathcdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/IMG-20220423-WA0039-18x24.jpg 18w, https://f5p3e9e4.stackpathcdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/IMG-20220423-WA0039-27x36.jpg 27w, https://f5p3e9e4.stackpathcdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/IMG-20220423-WA0039-37x48.jpg 37w" sizes="(max-width: 550px) 100vw, 550px" /> In 2019, Alaafin said he had forgiven Alao-Akala for his actions while he was governor of Oyo state. Alao-Akala had visited the palace of the Alaafin during his governorship campaign in 2019 — on the platform of the Action Democratic Party (ADP). “When a child talks to his father the way he (referring to Alao-Akala) spoke in that letter, it is obvious that he is a well-trained child. He is a good child and he acted like one and I have forgiven him because he is my child,” the Alaafin had said. A CRITIC OF PRESIDENT MUHAMMADU BUHARI’S HANDLING SECURITY One of his visits to Aso Villa in Abuja In 2019, the Alaafin of Oyo wrote a letter to Buhari in which he criticised the president’s handling of the farmer/herder conflicts, saying people in the south-west are worried about the “criminal activities of herdsmen” in the region. The monarch said the herdsmen, who sometimes carry out their criminal activities in military uniforms, have created a climate of fear and uncertainty in Yoruba land. “In Yoruba land, we are scared and worried about the outrageous audacity and effrontery of these criminal elements in carrying out their activities and without any challenge by security operatives,” the Alaafin wrote. During the pandemic, the Alaafin adhered to COVID-19 protocol wearing a face mask “Apart from massive destruction of farms and crops planted on them, the new wave of Fulani, pretending and disguising as herders have unleashed a reign of terror on Yoruba land. They destroy crops, they kidnap men and women, violate and rape our women, right in the presence of their husbands. “What this portends is definitely more than the simplistic interpretation of farmers/herders’ clash but the deliberate acts of hostility and criminality.” A BELIEVER IN RESTRUCTURING <img class="alignnone wp-image-690349" src="https://f5p3e9e4.stackpathcdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/Alaafin-of-Oyo14.png" alt="" width="550" height="321" srcset="https://f5p3e9e4.stackpathcdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/Alaafin-of-Oyo14.png 698w, https://f5p3e9e4.stackpathcdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/Alaafin-of-Oyo14-300x175.png 300w, https://f5p3e9e4.stackpathcdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/Alaafin-of-Oyo14-24x14.png 24w, https://f5p3e9e4.stackpathcdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/Alaafin-of-Oyo14-36x21.png 36w, https://f5p3e9e4.stackpathcdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/Alaafin-of-Oyo14-48x28.png 48w" sizes="(max-width: 550px) 100vw, 550px" /> The monarch believed that Nigeria needs to be restructured to make progress. In an interview with the Nigerian Tribune, the Alaafin said Nigeria would break up if the country did not restructure. The monarch said Nigerian leaders must ensure that the country was restructured to avoid forceful disintegration. The Alaafin and Makinde, Oyo state governor “I made my position clear in the paper I presented in Ibadan during the zonal summit on the subject. I said if we did not restructure Nigeria, what happened in USSR may happen,” the monarch had said. “USSR was divided with force. Romania also was divided through force. Their leaders were doing exactly what our leaders are doing now.” ADEYEMI III — OF MANY WIVES AND THE DESIRE TO BUILD MUSEUM FOR WOMEN The Alaafin with his wives Oba Adeyemi III had always shown his love for women. Adeyemi III was known for marrying several young women in his old age. The monarch married at least 13 wives. Abibat Adeyemi is often regarded as the first wife of the Alaafin. The Alaafin has many children, TheCable cannot confirm the number of children fathered by the monarch. In 2018, the king had three sets of twins from three of his queens. The Alaafin and some his children Speaking in an interview with Toyin Falola, professor of African studies, the monarch announced his intention to build a museum strictly meant for women, in which items used by women will be displayed. “I want to have a museum for women, the first in Africa, all the things women use in dressing up will be on display, I have been collecting these things for over 50 years now,” he had said. “Women are seen going naked now, which is not part of our culture, even in different parts of the world, they uphold their culture. In India, China, Saudi Arabia and all, they keep their culture, regardless of civilisation.” ‘I DON’T WOO WOMEN — WOMEN APPROACH ME‘ The Alaafin on his 82nd birthday Speaking in an interview in 2018, the monarch said he never approached any lady for a relationship. The Alaafin said his late younger sister introduced his first wife, adding that women do not like his “stoic” personality. “I have never approached a lady; they come to me. My first wife was a friend to my younger sister of blessed memory,” the monarch had said. “My sister introduced her to me and though she wasn’t educated, she gave me the first lawyer in our family, my son, Tunde. I truthfully do not know the art of chasing women. I don’t go out to chase women. “I am very stoic; I seldom laugh. Most times, it is impossible to know what is going on in my mind because you cannot read my emotions on my face and women don’t like that.” Adeyemi III Photo credit: Beejay Bright Royal Photography/@alaafin_oyo/Instagram
