President Muhammadu Buhari says immediate resolutions are needed to address the Russia-Ukraine war in order to prevent the impact from getting worse. The Russia-Ukraine war, which began on February 24, has resulted in the death of hundreds of people, while millions have been displaced. Earlier in April, the United Nations (UN) general assembly adopted a resolution calling for the suspension of Russia from the human rights council. Speaking on Thursday during an iftar organised for the diplomatic corps in Abuja, Buhari said the war has taken too long, adding that there is a need for countries involved to consider the humanitarian impact. “The war has lasted too long, cost so much and hurt too many people, well beyond the immediate theatres,” he was quoted as saying in a statement by Femi Adesina, presidential spokesman. “The rest of the world is progressively facing the impact of the conflict and this will certainly get worse, if an immediate resolution is not found, not least in the area of food security.” The president also commended the efforts of Antonio Gutteres, UN secretary-general, on his recent visits to Moscow and Kyiv as part of efforts to promote discussions on a ceasefire. “The United Nations must continue to actively lead the way for engagements that could ultimately unlock peace through diplomacy,” Buhari said. He also urged people across the world, especially the Muslim community, to use the period of Ramadan to continue to offer prayers for an end to the Russia-Ukraine conflict and for peace to return to the world.
