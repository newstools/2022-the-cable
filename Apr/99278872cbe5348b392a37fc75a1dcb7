Nigeria’s Flamingos beat their Egyptian counterpart 4-0 to secure a home advantage in the first leg of the U-17 FIFA World Cup qualifier series. Opeyemi Akamihe opened scoring for Nigeria in the 28th minute at the Moshood Abiola Stadium, Abuja. The girls doubled their lead in the 38th minute through a header by Omowunmi Bello. The Flamingos went into the half hour break with a comfortable 2-0 cushion. In the second half, Ajakaiye meandered her way past the Egyptian defence in the 46th minute but Judith Okah failed to make the opportunity count. Eight minutes later, defender Miracle Usani found herself with the ball just outside the Egyptian box, and slammed past goalkeeper El Taher for Nigeria’s third. In the 62nd minute, Bello again showed immense composure to lift the ball above onrushing El Taher, after she had been brilliantly played-in by the excellent Taiwo Afolabi on a counter-attack. The second leg comes up in a fortnight in Cairo on Friday, April 30. The winning team will tango with the winner of the fixture between Ethiopia and South Africa for a place in this year’s FIFA U17 Women’s World Cup. Earlier on Saturday, Ethiopia beat South Africa 3-0 away from home. The 2022 U-17 FIFA women’s World Cup is slated to take place in India from October 11-30.
