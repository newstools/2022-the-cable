Yusuf Lasun, former deputy speaker of the house of representatives, has joined the Labour Party (LP). The development comes days after he resigned his membership of the All Progressives Congress (APC). Lasun had dumped the ruling party hours before the national convention of the APC which was held on March 26. The former deputy speaker had contested the APC governorship primary on February 19, 2022. He contested against Gboyega Oyetola, governor of Osun, and Moshood Adeoti, a former secretary to the state government in the administration of Rauf Aregbesola. Oyetola had secured the party’s ticket, but the exercise was not without controversy. The incumbent governor was adjudged to have polled 222,169 votes; his closest challenger, Moshood Adeoti, secured 12,921 votes, while Lasun got 460. Speaking at a press conference on Thursday, Lasun announced that he will be the Labour Party’s candidate in the forthcoming Osun governorship poll. He said: “Twice, I have tried in another party but today, Labour Party has given me a platform to run. By the special grace of God, we are going to win. “Because of this opportunity given to me, I will be eternally grateful to members of the Labour Party, who stood firm despite the fact that no election has been won by the party since 1999 when we started this experience. “I am assuring you that I, Sulaimon Lasun Yusuf, have accepted the candidacy of the Labour Party to run for the governorship and we are going to win. As from today, you are not going to be talking to a candidate, but a governor-in-waiting.”
