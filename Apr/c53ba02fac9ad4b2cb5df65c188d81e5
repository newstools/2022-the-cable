The commissioners resigned ahead of their bid to contest various elective positions in the 2023 elections. Ganduje had directed all his political appointees interested in vying for elective positions to resign before Monday, April 18.

Those who resigned are Sunusi Kiru, commissioner for education; Murtala Garo, commissioner for local government and chieftancy affairs; Musa Kwankwaso, commissioner for rural development, and Nura Dankadi, commissioner for budget planning.

Farouq Garo, senior special assistant to the governor on monitoring and evaluation, also resigned from his position to pursue a political ambition. Garo said the resignation became pertinent to enable him serve the people in another capacity by contesting for the house of representatives seat for Gwarzo /Kabo federal constituency.
