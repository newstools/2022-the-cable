Femi Falana, human rights advocate and senior lawyer, says troops of the Nigerian Army are capable of defeating insurgents. The human rights lawyer spoke on Friday after the burial of Akinwumi Akinsola, the Kwara state chairman of Trade Union Congress (TUC), at Ijoko, Ogun state. TheCable had reported that Akinsola was killed during an attack on a Kaduna-bound train on March 28, 2022. Speaking on the country’s security challenges, Falana asked Nigerians to dismiss the proposal of Nasir el-Rufai, governor of Kaduna, that foreign mercenaries should be hired to fight insurgents. “l can say without any fear of contradiction that Nigeria has some of the most patriotic soldiers in the world,” NAN quoted him as saying. “All that is missing is appropriate weapons to fight the terrorists who are well-equipped. “I am speaking from my personal knowledge because I defend top-ranking soldiers — generals who are charged illegally for demanding weapons to fight terrorists. “Troops are prepared to fight, but they are simply saying it is suicidal to face terrorists with inadequate weapons.” On his part, Quadri Olaleye, TUC national president, urged members of the union not to be discouraged despite the death of two members —Musa-Lawal Ozigi, TUC secretary-general, and Akinsola — in the Kaduna train attack. “I call on union members to keep the flag flying and continue the struggle. As a trade union, good governance is our goal; that is why we established a programme to ensure stability in the system,” Olaleye said. “It was during our national tour that our members were attacked on the Abuja-Kaduna train service. Our comrades lost their lives for a purpose, which is stability and good governance.”
