The Adamawa police command says it has rescued 24 child victims trafficked from the state. According to NAN, Sikiru Akande, commissioner of police in the state, confirmed the development on Tuesday. Akande said the children were rescued following an intelligence report received from some parents in the state. He also said most of the minors are citizens of Adamawa, adding that some were rescued from Kaduna, Jos, Enugu and other parts of the country. “On the good work we are doing in this command, we traced some underaged children (boys and girls) who are indigenes of Adamawa state that had been taken for child labour across Nigeria,” he said. “Presently, 24 of them are in our custody. They were rescued from different parts of Nigeria. “The command does not have the facility to take care of this huge number of children. We, therefore, appeal to the state government and other non-governmental organisations to assist the command in taking care of the children.” The commissioner said the command is working to ensure that underaged children trafficked and used for hard labour are rescued across the country. He urged members of the public and parents whose children are missing to come for verification at the state police command.
