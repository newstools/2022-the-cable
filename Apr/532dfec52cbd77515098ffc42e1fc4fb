The Super Falcons played a 2-2 draw in the second of their two-match bouquet against Canada on Tuesday. Randy Waldrum’s girls put up a better performance against the Canadians than they did in the first game on Saturday. Ifeoma Onumonu netted the opener for the Falcons in the fifth minute of play at the Starlight Stadium in Victoria, Vancouver. The Falcons took their one-goal lead into the half-time break, but on resumption of the second stanza, Christine Sinclair scored the equaliser for the home side courtesy of a defensive error. The nine-time African champions offered greater tenacity against the Olympic champions, and this paid off as Rasheedat Ajibade scored the second goal for the Falcons in the 58th minute. Goalkeeper Chiamaka Nnadozie made several crucial saves to keep the Falcons in the lead but Shelina Zardosky was eventually able to net the equaliser for the home side to settle the scoreline at 2-2. Earlier on Saturday, two second-half goals by Jessie Fleming and Vanessa Gilles earned the Canadian team victory over the African champions in the first encounter. The two-match tour is part of the NFF’s activities to prepare the Falcons for the Africa Women Cup of Nations (AWCON). The 12th edition of the AWCON will take place in Morocco from July 2-23, 2022. The African women’s football showpiece will determine the four flagbearers from the continent at next year’s FIFA Women’s World Cup in Australia/New Zealand.
