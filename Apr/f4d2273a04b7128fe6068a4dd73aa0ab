Cee-C, whose real name is Cynthia Nwadiora, participated in the 2018 edition of the Big Brother Naija reality show. The fashion enthusiast was 25 years old at the time she was featured on the show. Before her stint on the show, the Enugu-born actress had graduated with a law degree from Madonna University in Anambra in 2014. VERIFICATION First of all, there are inconsistencies with the age of both parties as speculated by the blogs and social media posts. Cee-C was 29 years old as of the time the picture emerged online. According to publicly available information, Obasanjo was born in 1937 at Ibogun-Olaogun, Ogun state. As of 2021, Obasanjo was 84 years old and not 86 as claimed by the blog posts. The former head of state had married a few times. His ex-wives are Mojisola Adekunle, Stella Abebe, Lynda, and Esther Oluremi. He currently lives in Ogun state with Bola Obasanjo, whom he married in 2009. Now to the origin of the photograph: Cee-C posted the picture on December 13, 2021, saying she had a business meeting with the former president. Obasanjo and Cee-C Corroborating this, Linus Okorie, Nigerian leadership consultant and author, also posted a picture of himself, Nwadiora and the former president, on the same day. In a now-deleted post, Okorie said the meeting was a preparation for the launch of Guardians of the Nation International (GOTNI ), a nonprofit leadership development organisation. Okorie, Obasanjo and Cee-C “Had a great meeting today with this great Nigerian. Chief Olusegun Obasanjo our highly respected former president of Nigeria ” he wrote. “CeeCee a brilliant lawyer and celebrity was a part of the visiting team. Purpose of the meeting loading as GOTNI Leadership Centre prepares for her official launch.” VERDICT There is no sufficient evidence to prove the claim that the former president got married to the reality star.
