Yusuf Gagdi, a lawmaker representing Pankshin, Kanke and Kanam federal constituency of Plateau, says citizens should be allowed to carry arms to end insecurity. According to NAN, he said this in an interview with journalists in the state. TheCable had reported how gunmen invaded four communities in Plateau and killed an unconfirmed number of people. Gagdi called on the national assembly to enact laws that will permit Nigerians to defend themselves by bearing arms. He said legalising the bearing of arms would help address the rate of attacks and killings in communities. “If we want to curtail the spate of attacks in communities, we should make laws that will permit citizens to carry arms,” he said. “If for instance, those who attacked my people know that the locals also have arms, they won’t come, and even if they do, the casualty will not be this high. “But there must be regulation on the use of the arms; anyone who misuses it should be imprisoned or even sentenced to death by hanging. “But I tell you, if citizens are allowed to carry these arms to protect themselves, all these attacks and killings will end.” Gadji said the attack in his constituency could have been avoided, adding that security agencies need to always work on intelligence reports at their disposal to avert incidents that could lead to security breaches.
