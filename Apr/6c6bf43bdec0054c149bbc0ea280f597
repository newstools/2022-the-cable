Members of the Tinubu Support Group (TSG) have picked up the presidential nomination form of the All Progressives Congress (APC) for Bola Ahmed Tinubu. The ruling party had announced that the price of its presidential nomination form is N100 million. The price, which elicited widespread criticism, was fixed at the party’s national executive committee (NEC) meeting. The support group, led by James Faleke, a member of the house of representatives, picked up the form for Tinubu in Abuja on Friday. The former Lagos governor is currently in Saudi Arabia for Hajj. Speaking after securing the form, Babachir Lawal, a former secretary to the government of the federation (SGF), said Tinubu is not worried about other presidential hopefuls in the ruling party. Aminu Suleiman, director-general of the TSG, had on April 20 offered to purchase the nomination and expression of interest forms for Tinubu. “I, Hon. Aminu Suleiman (D.G TSO) would like to officially state that I have signed a cheque to the tune of 100 million naira, for the purchase of nomination and expression of interest form for our Leader @officialABAT. God bless,” he had said. Tinubu is one of the frontline runners for the ruling party’s presidential ticket. The former Lagos governor is up against Vice-President Yemi Osinbajo, David Umahi, governor of Ebonyi; Chris Ngige, minister of labour; Yahaya Bello, governor of Kogi; Rotimi Amaechi, minister of transportation, among others, for the APC ticket.
