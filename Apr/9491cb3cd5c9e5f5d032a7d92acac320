After another exciting weekend of football actions across Europe, TheCable selects the Nigerian team of the week. Maduka Okoye (Sparta Rotterdam) Pulled off fabulous saves and initiated some of the attacks for Sparta Rotterdam. He shouldn’t be blamed for the goal. Commanding. Kingsley Ehizibue (Koln) Ehizibue made a number of interceptions and clearances during the game. He was alert to any danger. Solid. Anthony Izuchukwu (Hapoel Haifa) The former Nigeria U23 defender had a wonderful game against Maccabi Petah Tikva. Concrete. Michael Ihiekwe (Rotherham United) Always aware of any danger, he made the most interceptions, most clearances and most tackles, while keeping the Sutton forwards at bay during the English Football League (EFL) cup final win for Rotherham. Comprehensive. Jamilu Collins (Paderborn) A man of the match performance with one assist from two shots on target. He was impossible to pick up. Scintillating. Anthony Uzodinma (Keciorengucu) A five star performance from the attacking midfielder, who scored a brace. Outstanding. Kelechi Iheanacho (Leicester City) Over the course of the game against Manchester United, he put over several dangerous crosses and scored the curtain-raiser. Piercing. Anayo Iwuala (Esperance) With a goal and assist, Iwuala was another true star of the show. CR Belouizdad had no answer to him and he had their defenders leaping. Magnificent. Taiwo Awoniyi (Union Berlin) A real menace who scored a goal and exemplified his all-around performance as Union Berlin won. Motivated. Paul Onuachu (Genk) A key cog in the Genk dream machine, he showed his full range of terrific strikes and netted a hat-trick. Menacing. Isaac Success (Udinese) He scored a brace and was always available when his teammates needed him. Relativistic.
