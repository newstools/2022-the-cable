Seyi Makinde, Oyo state governor, says his administration will follow due process in the selection of the new Alaafin of Oyo. TheCable had reported how Lamidi Adeyemi, late Alaafin of Oyo, died aged 83 after spending 52 years on the throne. Makinde said his administration understands the eagerness of the Oyo people to see a new king, but he urged them to be patient. The governor was represented by Bayo Lawal, the commissioner for local government and chieftaincy matters, at the eighth-day fidau/interdenominational prayer held in honour of the late monarch. “People are eager to see the next king, but we have to follow due process. We promise not to compromise and another Alaafin will come in due time,” Makinde said. In their separate sermons, Imam Masud Ajokidero and Reverend Eyitayo Sulola urged the Oyomesi (kingmakers) not to be swayed by moneybags in the selection process. In her remarks, Alaba Lawson, the Iyalode of Yorubaland, described the late Alaafin as the father of Yorubas who always fight for the right of his people. “He always listen to the cry of Yorubas and was a great historian. I wish the incoming king will sustain the legacies he left behind,” Lawson said, Oba AbdulRashid Anikulapo, the Onibode of Igboholand, said the late traditional ruler enthroned many south-west kings who were not beaded crown-wearing kings before he was enthroned in 1970.
