The Anambra state police command has repelled an attack by gunmen on Nteje divisional headquarters in Oyi LGA of the state. According to the police, the gunmen attacked the police station around 3am on Thursday. Ikenga Tochukwu, Anambra police spokesperson, in a statement on Thursday, said police officers repelled the gunmen, which led to the death of one of the gunmen. “The operatives recover one type O6 rifle, one magazine and fifty-three live ammunition of 5.56mm and charms,” Tochukwu said. “The commissioner of police, CP Echeng, led the crack squad, when responding to the distress call as the station came under attack by the deadly gang. “The police operatives decisively dealt with the assailants. During the gun duel, one of the gunmen was neutralised due to the superior fire of the police operatives and the assailants also fled the scene. The station was secured and all police operatives and arms are intact.” The attack came barely 24 hours after four police officers were killed in an attack on Atani police station in Ogbaru LGA of the state. In the past few months, Anambra and other states in the south-east region of the country have witnessed a spate of attacks on public facilities and security personnel. On April 7, the headquarters of Aguata LGA was razed by gunmen. Soludo hails from the LGA. On April 3, two personnel of the Federal Road Safety Corps (FRSC) were killed by gunmen in the state..
