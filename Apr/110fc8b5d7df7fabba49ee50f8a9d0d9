Yahaya Bello, governor of Kogi state, says if elected president in 2023, his administration would create 20 million millionaires by 2030. The governor, on Saturday, declared his intention to run for president on the platform of the All Progressives Congress (APC). The governor made his intention official on Saturday during an event at the Eagle Square in Abuja. Bello said he would consolidate on the legacy of President Muhammadu Buhari if he’s able to succeed him in office. “In 2018, with APC in the saddle that figure has dropped to about 87m people yet Nigeria overtook India as the poverty capital of the world,” he said. “Just this month, Nigeria through the effort of the President relinquished the title back to India and brought down the figure to about 70m people. “It is therefore clear that our path to national prosperity lies in pulling millions of Nigeria out of poverty. “The Buhari administration has a target of lifting 100 million Nigerians out of poverty by the year 2030. “A Yahaya Bello presidency will have an additional target of creating 20 million naira millionaires by the same year 2030 with the aim that each of them will empower five other citizens.” Hafsat Abiola-Costello, daughter of the late MKO Abiola, is the director-general of the Yahaya Bello presidential campaign organisation. Senator Jonathan Silas Zwingina is the national coordinator and chairman of the presidential campaign while Femi Fani-Kayode, former minister of aviation, is the deputy national coordinator and deputy chairman.
