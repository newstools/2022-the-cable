On Thursday, Cable Newspaper Ltd, publisher of TheCable, launched ‘Our Two Kobo’ podcast. The maiden episode, ‘The Girls of Chibok: Eight Years After’, is dedicated to the eighth anniversary of the abduction of 276 schoolgirls of Government Girls’ Secondary School (GGSS) Chibok, Borno state. In this episode, Jam Jam and The Honourable go down memory lane on how the insurgents invaded the school and made away with the girls, the government’s immediate and long-term efforts towards the safe return of the students. Since the incident, over 100 of the girls have escaped or been rescued while another 109 are still unaccounted for. Our hosts spoke to Allen Manasseh, strategic team member of the Bring Back Our Girls (BBOG) group; and Yakubu Nkeki, chairman of the Chibok parents’ association.
