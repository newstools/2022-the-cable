Manchester United held Chelsea to a 1-1 draw in their English Premier League (EPL) encounter at Old Trafford on Thursday night. The Red Devils were pummeled all night by Chelsea who were denied by David De Gea in goal before Cristiano Ronaldo performed another rescue act despite another abject performance from the 20-time EPL champions. Marcos Alonso had scored for Chelsea. The first half was all one-way traffic with Chelsea calling De Gea to action on several occasions, with the Spanish goalkeeper denying Kai Havertz severally while also preventing Timo Werner from continuing his improved form with a goal. The former Atletico Madrid shot-stopper was eventually breached by Alonso, his Spanish compatriot, who volleyed into the net from an angle to hand Chelsea the lead on the hour. Ronaldo equalised two minutes later, as the 37-year-old controlled a Nemanja Matic pass before finishing with an emphatic shot for 1-1. The goal is Ronaldo’s first-ever against Chelsea and his 17th in the league this season. Reece James almost scored the winner but was denied by the woodwork as both sides settled for a point apiece. Chelsea are in third position and 13 points behind Liverpool on the EPL table as their season peters out. Manchester United, however, have 55 points following just one win in six matches, with their top four aspirations all but fizzling out with three matches to the end of the season.
