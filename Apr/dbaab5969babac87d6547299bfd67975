Rotimi Amaechi, transportation minister and presidential hopeful, says citizens must come together to surmount the challenges confronting the country. In an Easter message on Sunday, Amaechi said it is only through unity and oneness that the country will be uplifted to greater heights. The presidential hopeful said Nigerians must be accommodating of one another’s religions and ethnic differences. “No matter our religious or ethnic differences, oneness and unity and achieving our dreams and goals as a people will take us to greater heights as a nation,” he said. “We need to come together as Nigerians to tackle our challenges, fight our battles as one united front, and make our country better. “As we celebrate the resurrection of Christ Jesus, this Easter, let us also reflect on our values, as Christians, as Nigerians, let us be accommodating to our brothers and sisters from different religions, tribes and ethnic nationalities. “Let us work together as a unit to make Nigeria the country of our dreams, the country we want. Together we can make it happen. I wish you all love, laughter and light. Happy Easter!”
