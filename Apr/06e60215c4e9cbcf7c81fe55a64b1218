Ifeanyi Okowa, governor of Delta state, says Nigeria needs to tap from the experience of former President Olusegun Obasanjo on nation building. Okowa said this on Tuesday when he visited Obasanjo in Abeokuta, the Ogun capital. According to a statement by Kehinde Akinyemi, spokesman to Obasanjo, the Delta governor said stakeholders, including traditional rulers, also need to be consulted on finding solutions to challenges affecting security and the economy. “This is something that is threatening the fabric of our unity and not something we have to play with. The situation is getting worrisome and it’s time we all have hands on deck to be able to find solution,” Okowa was quoted as saying. “As it stands today, the APC-run government cannot alone be able to deal with it, and they need to find wide and far-reaching consultation, not with those in government alone, but all stakeholders, particularly those who have been part of running this country before and now, including even religious leaders. “We need to sit together and discuss the way forward.” The governor described Obasanjo as ”someone who truly understands Nigeria through and through”, adding that Nigeria “needs to tap from him, especially at a time like this, which will help to shape this nation”. “I thank God for the wonderful discussions that I had with him. He is a respository of knowledge and experience,” the governor added. On his next line of action ahead of the 2023 general election, Okowa said he is yet to make up his mind on whether to contest the presidency. “As at today, I have not made up my mind. The important thing is not about myself; it’s about the nation,” he said. “Our dream is to see Nigeria begin to have an improvement in our security and in the economy. These are some things we have not achieved at the moment.”
