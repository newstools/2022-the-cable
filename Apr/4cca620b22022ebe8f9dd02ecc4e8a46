The Federal Competition and Consumer Protection Commission (FCCPC) says residents should leave the purchase, repair or replacement of electricity equipment to the distribution companies (DisCos). The commission, in a statement on its social media handles on Sunday, said consumers are not expected to be involved in the purchase, repair or replacement of transformers, poles or other associated electricity equipment, unless where necessary. The agency said it is the responsibility of DisCos to ensure that damaged transformers are replaced within 48 hours after being notified, adding that in situations where residents take action, a written agreement and due compensation should be made. “Electricity Consumer Right/Responsibility: It is not the responsibility of the customer or the community to purchase, replace or repair transformers, poles or other associated equipment used in the distribution of electricity,” the statement reads. “DisCos are required to replace damaged transformers within 48 hours of official notification. But if the DisCo is unable to do so, residents may enter into a previous written agreement on terms of replacement with the DisCo in accordance with the NERC Investment in Electricity Networks Regulation & get appropriate refund/compensation.” Addressing the issue of meter purchase, FCCPC said “customers can purchase meters using the MAP Framework”, but “DisCos are responsible for refunding or compensating customers who paid in advance for the meters”. “The cost of the meter is to be reimbursed in 36 equal monthly payments using consumer-purchased energy credits (tokens),” the agency added.
