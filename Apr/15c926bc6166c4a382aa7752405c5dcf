Sloane Stephens, American tennis star, was spotted donning the snazzy green and white jersey of the Super Eagles of Nigeria while training for the ongoing Madrid Open. In a video shared on her Twitter handle on Wednesday, the 29-year-old could be seen rocking Nigeria national team’s jersey as she shimmied her hips to return forehand and backhand strokes with her trainer. The training was held on one of the hard-baked clay courts of the ongoing Madrid Open as she continued to acclimatise to the treacherous turf of the competition. ¡Venga Madrid! @MutuaMadridOpen pic.twitter.com/xBCEXpJ39M — sloanestephens (@SloaneStephens) April 27, 2022  The American is billed to take on Ukraine’s Anhelina Kalinina on Thursday in the tournament’s round of 64. Stephens entered the competition off the back of an emphatic seventh WTA singles title at the Guadalajara Open in February. The tennis star broke into the spotlight in 2017 after she defeated Maddison Keys to claim the year’s US Open — her first and only Grand Slam. She would then follow it up with a runner up finish at the French Open the following year. In January, Stephens got married to Jozy Altidore, American footballer, having announced their engagement in 2019.
