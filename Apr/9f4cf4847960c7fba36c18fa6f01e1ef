There is confusion over new guidelines for aspirants seeking political offices on the platform of the All Progressives Congress (APC). The guidelines issued by the party stipulate that political appointees are expected to resign 30 days to the primaries. The APC guidelines will affect presidential hopefuls such as Rotimi Amaechi, transportation minister; and Chris Ngige, labour minister; as well as other party members who currently hold positions as political appointees across the country. Section 3(i) of the APC’s guidelines, which directs elective office hopefuls who are political appointees to resign 30 days before the primaries, provides that “no political appointee at any level shall be a voting delegate or be voted for the purpose of the nomination of candidates”. A source in the ruling party, who confirmed the development to TheCable on Wednesday, however, said the guidelines may be reconsidered. “Yes, the guidelines were issued but it seems the party will withdraw them,” the source said. Felix Morka, APC spokesman, is yet to respond to enquiries on the matter. Meanwhile, the party has fixed May 30 and June 1 for a special convention on its presidential primaries, while the primaries for governorship, state houses of assembly, house of representatives, and senate will hold on May 18, 20, 22 and 24, respectively. The new APC guidelines follow section 84(12) of the newly enacted electoral law which provides that: “No political appointee at any level shall be a voting delegate or be voted for at the convention or congress of any political party for the purpose of the nomination of candidates for any election.” The aforementioned provision of the electoral act is currently a matter in court.
