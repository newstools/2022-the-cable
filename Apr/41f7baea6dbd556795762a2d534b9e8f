Manchester City and Liverpool shared the spoils following a 2-2 draw in their English Premier League (EPL) encounter at the Etihad Stadium on Sunday. In a game that was expected to determine the likely destination of the EPL title, Kevin De Bruyne and Gabriel Jesus scored twice to give Man City the lead, but the host were pegged back on both occasions by Liverpool’s Diogo Jota and Sadio Mane. The entertaining and pulsating encounter had its first goal on five minutes through a De Bruyne shot that deflected off Joel Matip before rising beyond Alisson Becker into the net. The visitors quickly responded through Jota to restore parity. The Portuguese forward latched onto a Trent Alexander-Arnold cutback to slot into the net despite several bodies on the goal line. While Liverpool continued to play on the counter, a bold and dominating Man City took the lead eight minutes before the interval through Jesus. The Brazilian striker got on the end of Joao Cancelo’s deep cross to fire into the roof of the net via the crossbar and the EPL champions went into the break with a deserved lead. The lead only lasted a minute into the second half as Mane was on hand to pull Liverpool level for the second time in the match. The Senegalese forward was on the end of Salah’s well-tailored assist and he dispatched into the far corner for 2-2. Both sides continued to search for an elusive winning goal but Raheem Sterling’s strike was ruled out for offside by VAR. The draw ended Liverpool’s 10-match winning run in the league. Pep Guardiola’s Man City retain its one-point lead at the top of the table with 74 points from 31 matches while Liverpool are a point behind from same number of games. Elsewhere, Ademola Lookman, Super Eagles of Nigeria forward, scored the opener as Leicester recorded a 2-1 victory at the King Power stadium for a third consecutive league win at home. The victory moved Leicester City back to the top half of the EPL table. RESULTS
