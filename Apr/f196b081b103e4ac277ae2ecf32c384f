Yahaya Bello, presidential aspirant of the All Progressives Congress (APC), will pick his expression of interest and nomination forms on Wednesday. On April 2, Bello declared his intention to run for president in 2023, adding that he would build on the successes recorded by President Muhammadu Buhari’s administration. The party had released its primary election timetable ahead of the elections, while it also announced the fees for the nomination forms — presidential hopefuls are expected to pay N100 million, while those for governorship will pay N50 million. In a statement on Tuesday, Yemi Kolapo, director of media and publicity, Yahaya Bello Presidential Campaign Organisation, said the governor paid the N100 million for the forms on Tuesday. “With the payment for the forms, Bello’s teeming supporters should be rest assured that he will be on the ballot in the 2023 presidential race,” Kolapo said. “We are highly encouraged by the number of APC governors, leaders and stakeholders who have demonstrated their strong support for the candidacy of our principal. We reiterate that he is not known for betrayal. He is always very loyal to his own and his priorities have always been Nigeria. “Though the race officially begins now, it is on record that Bello has consistently been at the forefront of the contest. He has demonstrated this again by being the first to pay for the forms. “We urge delegates and indeed all Nigerians to shun divisive narratives in the interest of the nation and choose the best of the lot. We have no doubt that our tested and trusted national working committee members will put the interest of the party and that of Nigeria first in their activities around the process that will throw up the next flagbearer of the APC.” Kolapo noted that the past few months have witnessed persistent calls by different youth, women and professional groups across Nigeria on the Kogi governor to contest for the office of the president.
