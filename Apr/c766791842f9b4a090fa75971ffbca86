United States Vice-President Kamala Harris has tested positive for COVID. Kirsten Allen, the vice president’s press secretary, announced the development in a statement on Tuesday. Allen said the US vice-president is currently not showing any symptoms, adding that Kamala has not been in contact with President Joe Biden. “Today, Vice President Harris tested positive for COVID-19 on rapid and PCR tests. She has exhibited no symptoms, will isolate and continue to work from the Vice President’s residence,” the statement reads. “She has not been a close contact to the President or First Lady due to their respective recent travel schedules. “She will follow CDC guidelines and the advice of her physicians. The Vice President will return to the White House when she tests negative.” According to CNN, a White House official said Harris arrived at the White House on Tuesday morning, and went straight to take a test. She was reportedly scheduled to attend an intelligence briefing along with Biden. The official said after testing positive, she returned to her residence where she will be isolating. Harris took the second dose of the COVID vaccine in January 2021. She is also reported to have received her first booster dose in late October and a second booster vaccine on April 1. The vice president’s positive diagnosis comes more than a month after her husband, Doug Emhoff, tested positive for COVID. The US, like many countries, had recently lifted most of its COVID restrictions, including the requirement to wear masks.
