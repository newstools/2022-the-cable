Karim Benzema scored an extra-time goal to send Real Madrid into the UEFA Champions League (UCL) semi-final despite a 3-2 loss to Chelsea in the quarter-final second leg at the Santiago Bernabeu on Tuesday. The 13-time UCL winners stopped Chelsea’s potential comeback with two late goals, coming from three goals down to claim a 5-4 aggregate win in the two-legged tie. Goals from Mason Mount, Anthony Rudiger, and Timo Werner put Chelsea close to a historic comeback, but Real Madrid produced a late show thanks to goals from Rodrygo and Karim Benzema, the team’s talismanic striker, on a drama-filled night. The 120 minutes of wonderful football artistry started with Chelsea taking the lead on 15 minutes through a well-struck curling shot from Mount. After the interval, Rudiger made it 2-0 with a header before Werner handed Chelsea an aggregate lead against the slumbering European giants with a well-taken goal 15 minutes from time. A trio of changes woke the sleeping hosts with Rodrygo, one of the substitutes, volleying into the bottom corner ten minutes from time to force extra time where Benzema punished Chelsea with another header on 96 minutes. Chelsea continued to attack but Kai Havertz and Jorginho could not convert clear-cut chances as Real Madrid advanced to the semi-final for a second consecutive season while also ending Chelsea’s title defence. Villarreal also advanced into the UCL last four following a hard-fought 1-1 draw at Bayern Munich, thanks to Samuel Chukwueze’s last-minute goal. The Super Eagles winger latched on to a pass at the back post to find the roof of the net, leading the less-fancied Spanish la Liga side to its first appearance in the semi-finals in 16 years. RESULTS Real Madrid 2-3 Chelsea (Real Madrid advance with 5-4 aggregate win) Bayern Munich 1-1 Villarreal (Villarreal advance with 2-1 aggregate win)
