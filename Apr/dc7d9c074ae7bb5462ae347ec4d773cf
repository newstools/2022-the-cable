The Nigerian Railway Corporation (NRC) says 22 passengers are missing following the recent attack on the Abuja-Kaduna train. The NRC says it has confirmed the safety of 186 passengers, representing an increase of 14 persons from the last tally. The development comes almost one week after the train was attacked in the Kateri-Rijana area of the state. Giving an update in a statement issued on Sunday, Fidet Okhiria, NRC managing director, said “51 phone numbers on the manifest are either switched off or not reachable since Tuesday morning”. He said 35 phone numbers “are ringing but no response from the other end” while 60 phone numbers, when called, are said to be non-existent. “Two coaches earlier re-railed were safely moved to Rigasa Station. This brings the total number of recovered coaches and safely moved to NRC stations to 7,” he said. “Intensive work continues on track repairs. More concrete sleepers were moved to site while some section of twisted tracks has been straightened.” Since the incident, only eight passengers on board the train have been confirmed dead. The NRC had announced the suspension of the Abuja-Kaduna railway operation following the attack. TheCable had reported that Musa-Lawal Ozigi, TUC secretary-general; Akin Akinsola, TUC Kwara chairman; and Chinelo Nwando Megafu, a dental surgeon, were among those who died in the attack.
