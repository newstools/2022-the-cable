The Nigerian navy says it has acquired a new warship, NNS KADA, to improve security on the country’s coasts and regional waters. Adedotun Ayo-Vaughan, navy spokesman, who made this known in a statement on Saturday, said the change of flag ceremony was performed in the United Arab Emirates (UAE) He said the ship, which is expected in Nigeria on May 22, would berth at ports in Oman, Kenya, South Africa, Angola, and Gabon before arrival in the country. Awwal Gambo, chief of naval staff, said it is important for states on the coastlines to have a quality fleet that would necessitate naval power protection in support of national and regional stability. He said the homebound voyage of NNS KADA is another milestone achievement in the navy’s fleet recapitalisation efforts. Gambo said the recent survey and charting of Nigeria’s offshore waters by NNS LANA, and the addition of NNS KADA, will help deter maritime crimes and improve the well-being of Nigerians and maritime trade. On his part, Bashir Magashi, minister of defence, said NNS KADA was conceived as a replacement for the NNS AMBE and NNS OFIOM which were decommissioned about 10 years ago.
