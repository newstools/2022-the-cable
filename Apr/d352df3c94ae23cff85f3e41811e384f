The Nigeria Immigration Service (NIS) says its operatives discovered a handgun “concealed” in the luggage of a passenger who arrived the country from the United States. The agency said the traveller was arrested at the Murtala Muhammed International Airport in Lagos. Amos Okpu, assistant comptroller for immigration, disclosed the development in a statement on Wednesday. “The Lagos Airport Comptroller, CIS Kemi Nandap stated that the Service received a credible intelligence that the passenger had boarded for Nigeria in Houston and had concealed a firearm in his luggage,” the statement reads. “Upon arrival we declared him a person of interest and contacted the Customs Service for a search on his luggages. The handgun and 26 rounds of 9mm ammunition were recovered from him. “The passenger who holds dual nationality of Nigeria and the United States is currently with us undergoing further interrogation to determine his intentions of bringing in the firearm. “The acting Comptroller-General of Immigration, Isah Jere Idris, wishes to use this medium to advise travellers on the need to always comply with acceptable best practices when embarking on foreign trip.”
