Nyesom Wike, governor of Rivers, has declared Farah Dagogo, a member of the house representatives, wanted for allegedly hiring cultists to attack the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) secretariat in the state. Dagogo represents the Degema/Bonny federal constituency of Rivers state at the national assembly. In a statement on Wednesday, Kelvin Ebiri, the governor’s special assistant on media, said Wike has asked the police to arrest the PDP lawmaker for deploying thugs to disrupt the screening of aspirants for various elective positions at the secretariat in Port Harcourt, the state capital. “The police must as a matter of urgency arrest Farah Dagogo wherever he is and must be made to face prosecution,” the governor was quoted to have said. “Already, some of the hoodlums hired by Farah Dagogo have been arrested and will be made to face the full wrath of the law.” Before moving into politics, Dagogo was said to be a field commander of the Movement for the Emancipation of the Niger Delta (MEND) but surrendered his arms in 2009 during an amnesty programme by the federal government. He later served as a lawmaker in the Rivers state house of assembly representing Degema constituency.
