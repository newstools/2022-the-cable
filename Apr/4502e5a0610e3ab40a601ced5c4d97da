At first glance, there is no indication that they are persons with disabilities (PWDs). But Betty Olayikan and Yewande Odutoye, who are deaf and currently work at the Sheraton Hotel Lagos, have had interesting experiences growing up. Betty wasn’t born deaf. She lost her auditory perception after she took ill. She, however, said stigma wasn’t so much of a problem as she had a solid support system, and would often keep to herself. “Growing up, I wanted to be a big caterer. Life as a deaf person has not been easy. But for my family, it was easy because my parents loved and accepted me,” she said. Speaking on her job, which she secured through Project Enable Africa and the Youth Empowerment Program, Betty said she enjoys working in the kitchen at Sheraton Lagos Hotel. “There were things I couldn’t do before but I can now do. I’ll advise deaf people to focus on their education. It’s very important. In the future, I want to be very popular and would also like to advocate that persons with disability also have ability,” she added. Yewande Odutoye, a worker at the housekeeping department of Sheraton Lagos Hotel, was born deaf. She, however, said although growing up was tough, she is grateful for the opportunity of working at the hotel. “My parents didn’t discover it on time till I was three years old. I graduated from Ekiti State University. Growing up, I had a passion for deaf children and I hoped to become a teacher to mentor deaf children,” she said. “Life wasn’t easy growing up. Because I could talk, my colleagues and teachers didn’t really get that I was deaf. So, most times, I would lip-read them to get what they were saying. I experienced discrimination, neglect and hatred, especially as a deaf lady. “I want to appreciate Project Enable for pushing me.”
