Abiodun Akabi, Lagos state commissioner of police, has warned against protests at the Lekki-Ikoyi bridge link. His statement comes as the Lekki Concession Company (LCC) commenced tolling operations at the Lekki-Ikoyi link bridge on Friday. The company had suspended its operations at the Lekki tollgate after the shooting of protesters during the #EndSARS protest on October 20, 2020. Pursuant to this development, brows have been raised over the commencement of tolling operations, with dissidents claiming it is a show of impunity by the state government. But reacting to this on Friday, Alabi said intending protesters found infringing on the rights of other Nigerians will be dealt with in accordance with the law. In a statement released by Benjamin Hundeyin, the Lagos police spokesperson, Alabi said protesting at the tollgate is capable of grounding commercial activities in the area and obstructing the flow of traffic. Alabi advised Nigerians to go about their lawful duties without fear of harassment and intimidation because the force will ensure the safety of lives and property. “While the command is not averse to the peoples’ right to freedom of assembly and association; and expression, the command will equally live up to its mandate of ensuring that no person or group of persons is allowed to infringe on the fundamental human rights of others, especially the rights to freedom of movement and right to dignity of human persons,” he said. “CP Alabi therefore warns all intending protesters that anyone found infringing on the rights of other Nigerians will be dealt with in accordance with the law. “Meanwhile, CP Alabi once again enjoins all peace loving Lagosians to go about their lawful duties without fear of harassment or intimidation, reiterating that adequate security assets have been strategically deployed to ensure their safety and security.”
