A federal high in Abuja has fixed May 18 to deliver a ruling on an application seeking bail for Nnamdi Kanu, leader of the Indigenous People of Biafra (IPOB). Kanu was re-arraigned on an amended 15-count charge bordering on treasonable felony. However, at the court session on Friday, Binta Nyako, the presiding judge, struck out eight out of the 15-count charge. While counts 6,7,9,10,11,12,13 and 14 were struck out, the defendant is to stand trial on counts 1,2,3,4,5,8 and 15. Shortly after the court’s ruling, Mike Ozekhome, Kanu’s lead counsel, moved an application for bail. Ozekhome said: “Until a person is tried and convicted, he should be allowed to walk free.” He reminded the court that a defendant ought to enjoy the presumption of innocence until proven guilty. “I humbly urge my lord to use your discretion to grant him bail subject to my lord’s condition,” he said. “You can limit him to stay in my house and I will not allow him to move around,” the lawyer added jokingly. Responding, Shuaibu Labaran, prosecution counsel, prayed the court to refuse the application, adding that Kanu had allegedly violated the earlier bail granted him. “My lord granted him bail in 2017 on health grounds, but since then until date, no medical record was submitted to the court until he jumped bail,” he said. “What we should be saying is contempt of court because he has flagrantly violated the orders of the court.” He urged the judge to be guided by her discretion vis-a-vis the circumstances of the case “and in the alternative, order accelerated hearing on this matter so that the defendant can know his fate one way or the order.” The judge adjourned the matter to May 18 to deliver ruling on the bail application.
