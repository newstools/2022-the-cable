Okwesilieze Nwodo, former national chairman of the PDP, says the crisis in Imo state is not politically motivated. The former Enugu governor, who said this on Sunrise Daily, a Channels Television programme, on Monday, was reacting to a statement made by Hope Uzodimma, Imo state governor. Uzodimma had said constant attacks on lives, government property and private-owned structures in the state are politically-sponsored. But in his reaction, Nwodo said the attacks in the state are not politically motivated since no politician has taken credit for the actions. He advised the governor to seek dialogue with the youths rather than blaming politicians for the crisis in the state. “I don’t agree with the governor. I don’t believe that it’s politically motivated because no politician is taking credit for whatever is happening in that place,” he said. “Instead, the youth feel like instead of their government cooperating with them, they feel it’s close cooperation with the federal government to stifle their agitation. So the reaction is that they fight back. “I think the governor should remove his mind from political causes.” Also speaking on the crisis in the south-east, the former governor said the biggest problem facing the region is that of unemployment. He said if the youths are invited for dialogue and empowered with job opportunities, the crisis in the region will be a thing of the past. “The biggest problem we have is unemployment. Massive unemployment even of graduates,” he said. “The second thing is the absence of sincere dialogue with the young people. Apart from the fact that they have no jobs, they feel extremely marginalised. “We have had a set of committees in the past and we have a current one led by Prof Ogbu. “They have produced a beautiful blueprint where they can take us to the point where we become the Dubai of west Africa. But we haven’t gotten the political will of the leaders in the zone to implement that blueprint.”
