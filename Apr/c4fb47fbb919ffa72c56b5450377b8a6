There was mild drama in Akure, the Ondo capital, on Tuesday, as soldiers clashed with Amotekun operatives over the seizure of some cows in the area. The Amotekun operatives were said to have seized the cows following distress calls by some farmers in Oke-Aro community in Akure, that the animals had destroyed their crops. But as the Amotekun operatives were taking the cows away, some soldiers said to be attached to the 32 artillery brigade, in Owena cantonment, Akure, refused to allow the animals to be taken away. The soldiers were said to have claimed that the cows belonged to officers in the barracks. What started as an argument was said to have degenerated into a clash, resulting in shooting — although there was no report of casualties. “The Amotekun operatives were taking the cows to their office at Alagbaka, when about 10 soldiers arrived in a Hilux vehicle,” a resident who witnessed the incident said. “The soldiers refused to allow the Amotekun operatives go away with the cows as they claimed that the animals belonged to officers from the military barracks. “The Amotekun operatives insisted on seizing the cows on the grounds that the anti-open grazing law had been violated. “However, trouble started after the argument led to exchange of blows between officers of the two security agencies. Next thing we knew, they were shooting into the air and residents fled for safety.” Speaking on the incident, Adetunji Adeleye, Ondo state commander of Amotekun, said the incident was “a minor disagreement between the officers”. “It has been resolved amicably. It was the arrested herders that hid under the soldiers to cause misunderstanding between the security outfits,” he added. Meanwhile, the development comes months after the Ondo government banned open grazing in the state. Rotimi Akeredolu, governor of Ondo, had signed the anti-open grazing bill into law in August 2021.
