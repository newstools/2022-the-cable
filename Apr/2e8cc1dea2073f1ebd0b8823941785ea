Ahmed Audi, commandant-general of the Nigeria Security and Civil Defence Corps (NSCDC), says President Muhammadu Buhari has approved funds for the agency to procure gunboats to tackle oil thieves. Audi said this in Abuja on Friday while addressing state commandants and other top management staff of the corps. Recently, the federal government had declared a clampdown on illegal oil refining activities. Speaking on the development, the NSCDC CG said the corps has finalised plans to acquire the gunboats for surveillance operations in riverine areas. According to Audi, the corps has also acquired sensitive intelligence equipment that would be deployed to states to aid information gathering. “Intelligence gathering and effective synergy is what will help nip insecurity in the bud,” NAN quoted him as saying. “We have realised that the intelligence reports state commandants are giving us are not enough. Citizens need to also know that the fight against insecurity should be of concern to all.” The commandant-general urged state commandants to work closely with governments to combat the increasing rate of insecurity in the country. He also advised them on the role of traditional leaders and locals and how they can provide support at the grassroots level. “The corps is fully committed to efforts that will make the nation safe — for crimes and criminalities not to thrive,” he added. Audi also said Rauf Aregbesola, minister of interior, had approved a set of new uniforms which would be unveiled after the completion of the necessary protocol. “They are of two sets. Grade one is almost at the stage of final approval, while the other, which is for operational purpose, will be ready later,” he said. Meanwhile, the announcement on the procurement of gunboats comes weeks after the Nigerian Upstream Petroleum Regulatory Commission (NUPRC) said the country loses more than 115,000 barrels per day to oil theft and vandalism.
