The National Drug Law Enforcement Agency (NDLEA) says it has marked some properties “linked” to Abba Kyari, suspended deputy commissioner of police, for investigation. The properties, which include shops and residential houses, are located in Borno, Lagos, Kano and the federal capital territory (FCT). On February 14, the NDLEA declared Kyari wanted over alleged link to an international drug cartel. Subsequently, the suspended police officer and four others were arraigned over allegations of drug trafficking. Speaking with TheCable on Wednesday, Femi Babafemi, NDLEA spokesperson, said the agency is currently marking properties “linked” to Kyari, adding that the total number will be disclosed after the completion of the process. “They are located in Borno, Abuja, Lagos and Kano. I can’t disclose the total number of the properties because the process is still going on. When we are done with the compilation and the marking, we have nothing to hide, we will make it public,” Babafemi said. “We have an arm of the agency that deals with assets and financial investigation of suspects that we are being investigated or prosecuted so that arm is doing its part of the work.” On Monday, NDLEA announced that its operatives have arrested Afam Ukatu, chairman of Mallinson group of companies, over an alleged N3 billion tramadol deal linked to Kyari. The NDLEA spokesperson said Utaku has been under the watch of the agency since 2021 after undercover police officers from Kyari’s team seized five cartons of tramadol from one of his staff.
