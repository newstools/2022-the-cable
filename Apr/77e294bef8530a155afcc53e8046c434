Akeem Adeyemi, son of the late Alaafin of Oyo, says his father committed his life to the protection of Yoruba culture and tradition. Lamidi Adeyemi, the Alaafin of Oyo, died on Friday evening at the Afe Babalola Teaching Hospital in Ado Ekiti. He was aged 83 and ruled for over 50 years. Speaking at the Alaafin’s palace in Oyo when funeral rites were being performed ahead of the late king’s burial, Adeyemi, a lawmaker representing Oyo federal constituency at the house of representatives, said his father was a man of peace who also ensured that Oyo town developed during his reign. “We are celebrating the life of our father that was well spent. We love him. The demise is shocking. Alaafin lived a life as a core traditionalist. He was a principled man; he was brave. The core of tradition of Yorubaland was paramount to him. He lived and died for Yoruba culture, tradition and religion. He was a man of peace,” Akeem said. “The Alaafin could have differences with you but everybody knows that he reconciled before he died. He was a man who gave Oyo its true name. He was a man who truly represented the culture and tradition of Yorubaland. “He was a man who was a symbol of Yoruba tradition; a man who was full of wisdom; a man who was truly a monarch in the Yoruba system; a man who was an epitome of wisdom.” Speaking about the king’s legacies, the lawmaker said his father showed the world that there is reward in being upright. “His was a legacy to tell the truth at all times no matter whose ox is gored; a legacy of being principled, with service to humanity,” he said. “In his entire life, he lived for service to humanity. As a king, he would not be in competition with any economic issue that would adversely affect his subjects. He was a man who loved his people.”
