The All Progressives Congress (APC) national executive committee (NEC) has vested the party’s national working committee (NWC) with its powers for three months. Within this period, the NWC led by Abdullahi Adamu, APC national chairman, will take decisions on behalf of the party’s NEC. The decision to transfer the NEC’s powers to the NWC followed a motion sponsored by Senate President Ahmad Lawan. The motion was seconded by Nasir el-Rufai, Kaduna governor, Iyiola Omisore, APC national secretary, told journalists. Omisore said the NEC resolved to transfer its powers in line with article 13(3) of the party’s constitution. This means the party’s NWC could solely fix the party’s schedule ahead of the 2023 general election. According to the stipulations of the Electoral Act, 2022, primary elections are expected to have been concluded by June 3. Bola Tinubu, former Lagos governor, Vice-President Yemi Osinbajo, Rotimi Amaechi, minister of transportation, and Chris Ngige, minister of labour and employment, are some of the APC chieftains who have declared their interest to contest for president in 2023.
