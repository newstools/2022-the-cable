Usman Baba, the inspector-general of police (IGP), has approved the promotion of 21,039 officers. According to a statement issued on Thursday by Olumuyiwa Adejobi, spokesman of the Nigeria Police Force (NPF), the promotion was approved on Wednesday. Adejobi said the promotion was for officers whose last promotion dates were “on or before 2017”. A total of 20,572 sergeants were promoted to the rank of inspector; 324 corporals to sergeants, and 143 constables to the rank of corporal. According to Adejobi, the exercise is part of efforts by the NPF to improve the welfare and conditions of service for officers. “The IGP further noted that the promotion of the officers is part of the manpower development drive of his administration to ensure that deserving personnel are promoted accordingly, to encourage hard work, and further embed the culture of merit, excellence, and dedication to duties,” the statement reads. “The IGP equally assured senior police officers that the Force high command is liaising with the Police Service Commission on the release of their promotion, which is expected to be approved and released as soon as possible. “The Inspector-General of Police, while commending the newly promoted officers for their resilience and invaluable commitment to duties, charged them to see their promotion as a call for renewed zeal, vigour, patriotism to duty, and further re-dedication to professional policing standards. “The IGP equally restated the commitment of his administration to entrenching longstanding reforms in the Nigeria Police Force.”
