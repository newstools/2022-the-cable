Spain and Germany, two European powerhouses, have been drawn together in Group E ahead of the FIFA World Cup later in the year. The draws were held in Qatar on Friday evening. Both European sides squared off in the final of the 2010 FIFA World Cup in South Africa where Spain prevailed 1-0 via an extra-time winner by Andres Iniesta. Both World Cup winners will be joined by Japan and the winner of an intercontinental playoff slugfest between the trio of the United Arab Emirates, Australia and Peru. The draws that included World Cup legends such as Nigeria’s Austin Jay-Jay Okocha, Raba Madjer, Lothar Matthaus, Tim Cahill among others also see France, the World Cup champions, in Group D alongside Denmark, Tunisia, and the winner of the second intercontinental playoff slugfest between Ukraine, Scotland and Wales. Brazil lead Group G which also has Cameroon, Serbia and Switzerland, while Ghana, conquerors of Nigeria, will face Uruguay in Group H. The Qatar World Cup will contain 32 teams that will be divided into eight groups — although only 29 teams have been confirmed. See full draws below: Group A Qatar
