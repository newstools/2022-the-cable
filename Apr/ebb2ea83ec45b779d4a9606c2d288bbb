Liverpool scored twice in both halves to cruise past Manchester United 4-0 in their English Premier League (EPL) encounter at Anfield on Tuesday night. Goals from Luiz Diaz, Mohamed Salah (brace), and Sadio Mane were enough to send the Reds to the top of the EPL ahead of Manchester City. Manchester United assembled a rag-tag starting line-up missing Cristiano Ronaldo, their talisman who was absent following personal bereavement while Liverpool presented its fearsome forwards. Unsurprisingly, it was Liverpool that started the match on the front foot and took a deserved lead in five minutes, with a Fabinho pass tearing Man United’s defence apart for Diaz to slot in Salah’s pass for 1-0. Salah, the Egyptian striker, was again on hand to punish United and double the lead in 22 minutes, latching onto Mane’s cushioned pass to slot beyond David de Gea for 2-0. An underwhelming Man United attack put up some efforts early in the second half but Liverpool made it 3-0 in 66 minutes, courtesy of a beautifully placed goal by Mane. Salah then added a chipped effort on 85 minutes to complete his brace and the rout with his fifth goal against Man United this season. It was also Salah’s first goal from open play in two months. Following the comfortable win, Liverpool have 76 points from 32 matches, two points ahead of Man City who have played a game less as the title race between both sides enters the final stretch of the season.
