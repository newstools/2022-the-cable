Members of the All Progressives Congress (APC) in Yagba federal constituency have endorsed Kingsley Fanwo, Kogi commissioner for information and communications, as the party’s candidate for the house of representatives in the 2023 elections. Fanwo received the endorsement on Saturday when he paid a “consultation visit” to APC executives in Mopamuro and Yagba West LGA of the state. In his remarks, the commissioner expressed confidence in the people to ensure his victory both in the primary and the general election. He advised his supporters to shun violence and keep peace with supporters of other aspirants, adding that “we are all one and working towards the progress of our party and constituency”. “We need the support of everybody in the party as well as in the opposition,” he said. Fanwo also enjoined the people to support the presidential ambition of Yahaya Bello, Kogi governor. Responding, Charles Omoyele, the APC chairman in Mopamuro LGA, urged his constituents to unite and support Fanwo “because he is our own and we must take it as our project”. Others who also endorsed the commissioner are Sunday Alumo, executive chairman, Mopamuro LGA; and Imole Suwale, assistant women leader in the LGA. At the APC secretariat in Odo-Ere, Yagba west LGA, Samuel David, party chairman in the LGA, said the executive members have endorsed Fanwo as their candidate for Yagba federal constituency.
