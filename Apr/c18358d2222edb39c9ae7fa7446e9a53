According to Haq in a statement, the UN secretary-general will also visit Senegal and Niger Republic. He explained that during the visit, Guterres will hold discussions with the presidents of the three countries, and also meet with representatives of various communities affected by violence. “On Saturday, the Secretary-General will begin a Ramadan solidarity visit to Senegal, Niger and Nigeria, during which he will also highlight the impact of the Ukraine war on the African continent,” Haq said. “The Secretary-General will meet and share an Iftar dinner with President Macky Sall of Senegal, who assumed the presidency of the African Union earlier this year. “He will also take part in Eid celebrations with President Mohamed Bazoum of Niger, and he is scheduled to meet President Muhammadu Buhari of Nigeria. “In the three countries, the Secretary‑General will have meetings with senior Government officials, as well as civil society representatives, including women, youth groups and religious leaders. He will meet families deeply affected by violence and instability in the Sahel, including people internally displaced and refugees. “Mr. [António] Guterres will also see first-hand the impact of climate change on vulnerable communities and will assess progress and challenges to the COVID-19 recovery. “The Secretary‑General began annual Ramadan solidarity visits when he was High Commissioner for Refugees, but the tradition was interrupted by the pandemic. This year, he will also use the visit to express his solidarity with victims of terrorism in the region.”
