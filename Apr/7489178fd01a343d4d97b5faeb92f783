Bola Tinubu, presidential hopeful of the All Progressives Congress (APC), says young Nigerians cannot be blamed for being “lazy” with erratic electricity supply in the country. Tinubu spoke on Saturday at a rally of south-west youths of the ruling party. In January, the former Lagos governor announced his intention to contest the presidential race on the platform of the APC. Speaking at the rally, Tinubu said no nation can witness “rapid development” without electricity, adding that the country cannot continue to give “excuses” for failure to generate a stable power supply. The presidential hopeful added that the country is blessed with enough gas that can be used to generate electricity and even export to European countries. “We cannot continue with excuses on NEPA failure. No! No nation can make rapid development without electricity,” Tinubu said. “Give us that, and if we cannot be successful, you can abuse us. You cannot give us erratic electricity that is undependable and then blame us again that we are lazy. No! “Nigeria — it is about time. We have enough gas to fire up our electricity. We can supply the rest of Europe with gas, and we can make money from it.” In April 2018, TheCable reported that President Muhammadu Buhari said many Nigerian youths just want to sit down and do nothing, banking on the notion that Nigeria is an oil-rich nation. Buhari, who was speaking at the Commonwealth Business Forum in Westminster, said a lot of Nigerian youths have not been to school, and they want everything free. The president’s comment sparked massive online protest, which led to the creation of the hashtag — #LazyNigerianYouths — to counter the president.
