Ibikunle Amosun, senator representing Ogun central, is set to declare his interest in running for president, TheCable understands. According to sources, the former Ogun governor is expected to announce his presidential bid at an event scheduled to take place on May 5. “Everything is set. He will formally declare his bid on May 5,” a source said. If all goes according to plan, the former Ogun governor, who is a member of the All Progressives Congress (APC), is set to challenge the likes of Vice-President Yemi Osinbajo, Bola Tinubu, Rochas Okorocha, David Umahi, Yahaya Bello, Rotimi Amaechi, among others, for the party’s presidential ticket. Amosun’s reported interest in the presidency comes three years after he was a major feature in the news over the controversy in his state in the build-up to the 2019 governorship election. The former governor, at the end of his second term in office, had supported Adekunle Akinlade for the APC’s governorship ticket in the 2019 election but the latter lost the party’s primary to Dapo Abiodun. Following the loss, Akinlade defected to the Allied Peoples Movement (APM) and became the governorship candidate of the party. The APM, however, lost the election and Akinlade has since rejoined the APC. Meanwhile, the APC national working committee (NWC) at the time suspended Amosun for “anti-party activities” days before the 2019 governorship election. Months afterwards, the NWC lifted the suspension.
