The federal capital territory administration (FCTA) has sealed off the ministry of works and housing, Federal Character Commission (FCC), the Nigerian National Merit house Maitama and Murg plaza over waste management debts owed to Abuja Environmental Protection Board (AEPB). In a statement on Monday, Osilama Briamah, director of the AEPB, disclosed the planned lockdown, adding that the measure was coming on the heels of the task team set up by Olusade Adesola, FCTA permanent secretary, to recover over N10 billion owed the AEPB by several government agencies, business premises, and residential apartments. He said the task team had been mandated to apply all legal means to recover the sums of money from the debtors and that the lockdown would begin from 5:30 am on Tuesday. “As workers prepare to resume work after the Easter holiday, some government offices, hotels, plazas and other business premises may be under lock and key due to debts owed to the Abuja Environmental Protection Board (AEPB),” he had said. Leading the enforcement of the lockdown on Tuesday, Ikahro Attah, senior special assistant on monitoring, inspection, and enforcement to the FCT minister, reportedly said the FCTA is worried about the high amount being owed to it. “FCT Administration needs enough fund to build infrastructure and keep the city running. The administration has decided to go after the Ministries, parastatals, agencies and private individuals. We cannot wait to see government money tied down, it’s wrong for people not to pay for services rendered,” he said.
