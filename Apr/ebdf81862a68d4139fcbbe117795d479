Babajide Sanwo-Olu, governor of Lagos state, says Nigerian workers are the lifeblood of the economy. In an address to mark the 2022 International Workers Day, Sanwo-Olu commended Lagos workers for their passion and commitment to the development of the state and Nigeria. The governor urged public and private workers in the state to remain productive and committed to carrying out their duties. “Happy Workers’ Day to all our committed and hardworking workers in the public and private sectors,” Sanwo-Olu said. “We appreciate your contributions; they are indeed the lifeblood of our economy because without the contributions of the workers, no government can achieve its dream. “Nigerian workers are the fabric that makes up the society as a result of their tireless contributions to the socio-economic development of the country. We appreciate all workers, both in the public and private sectors for their patience, strength and commitment to the growth and development of our dear Lagos State and Nigeria.” He urged workers to keep working with the government to take the state to greater heights. “As we join the rest of the world today, to celebrate International Workers’ Day, I implore all workers, especially those in Lagos State to remain productive and committed to duty. We must all join hands together to take Lagos to greater heights in line with our administration’s Greater Lagos agenda,” he said. “As a government, we will continue to make the welfare of workers our priority and ensure that we play our role in creating a good working environment for workers in the state. I congratulate all our workers on the 2022 International Workers’ Day.”
