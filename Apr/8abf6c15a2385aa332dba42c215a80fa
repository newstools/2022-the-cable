About 43 women and children have been rescued from Boko Haram captivity in Borno state, security sources said on Friday. The rescued victims were said to have been rescued when troops of the army’s 202 battalion deployed under 21 sector 1 operation Hadin Kai engaged in a gun battle with suspected insurgents. According to Zagazola Makama, a counter insurgency expert in the region, troops also killed 13 Boko Haram fighters. The troops were said to have carried out the operation in collaboration with the Civilian Joint Task Force (CJTF). The troops reportedly stormed the hideouts of insurgents at Mallum Masari and Gabchari, Mantari, Kanari, Markas, Garin and Baban Baba villages in Bama LGA of Borno state on Thursday. Some insurgents were said to have escaped with gunshot wounds, while troops recovered nine AK-47 rifles, six AK-47 magazines loaded with rounds of ammunition, bicycles and motorcycles. “They are Mujahedeens from the faction of Abubakar Shekau who were running from military onslaught in Sambisa forest,” one of the insurgents who was reportedly captured was quoted as saying. “We are running from the Nigerian soldiers because they have dominated most parts of our camps in Sambisa forest. We are hiding in these villages because even if we run to Lake Chad, ISWAP will fight us.” Onyema Nwachukwu, army spokesperson, was not immediately available to comment on the recent development. However, in a statement on Friday, the army said it recorded more success against insurgents. “Ongoing offensive onslaught by troops of operation Desert Sanity records another feat as several ISWAP/Boko Haram terrorists were neutralised around Kangarwa/Metele in Borno State. Weapons and ammunition amongst others were also recovered,” the statement reads.
