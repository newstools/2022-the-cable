The supreme court has affirmed the nullification of the participation of the All Progressives Congress (APC) and its candidate, Andy Uba, in the November 2021 Anambra governorship election. In the judgment delivered on Tuesday, the apex court, in a unanimous decision by a five-member panel of justices, held that Uba did not emerge through a valid primary. The court held that the primary which produced Uba was conducted in breach of the party’s guidelines. George Moghalu, an aspirant in the APC primary election, had approached the court challenging the process and the outcome of the primary. He sought N122.5 million in damages, including a return of the cost paid for expression of interest and nomination forms, as well as N100 million “for the breach of contract to commence and conclude primary election”. In a judgment delivered in December 2021, Inyang Ekwo, a federal high court judge, had held that the primary that produced Uba was not validly conducted as it was in breach of the electoral act and the party’s constitution. He had described the conduct of the primary by APC as “crude and primitive” and ordered INEC to delete Uba’s name from its record as a candidate in the election. Ekwo had also ordered the party to refund the N22.5 million paid by Moghalu for expression of interest and nomination forms. The appeal court, on February 23, said it found no reason to set aside the high court judgment that disqualified Uba and the APC. The decision was affirmed by the apex court on Tuesday.
