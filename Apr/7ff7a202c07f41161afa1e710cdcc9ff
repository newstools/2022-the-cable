Sadio Mane scored two first-half goals to propel Liverpool to a 3-2 win over Manchester City in their English FA Cup semi-final tie at Wembley on Saturday. The Reds capitalised on an error-strewn and lethargic performance from the usually assured Man City without Kevin De Bruyne, Ederson Moraes, Aymeric Laporte, and Rodri Hernandez, all four regulars left on the bench. Liverpool was however at full strength as the Anfield side continue their chase of an improbable quadruple this season. Jurgen Klopp’s men got to a flying start with the lead on nine minutes through Ibrahima Konate’s header from an Andy Robertson corner kick before Mane scored his first of the afternoon on 17 minutes. The Senegalese forward pounced on a Zack Steffen error, sliding the ball into the net at the feet of the hesitant goalkeeper who took too long to make a decision. Mane completed his brace on the stroke of half-time, converting a volley at the near post to hand Liverpool a commanding 3-0 lead at halftime. The Cityzens improved in the second period and scored two minutes in when Jack Grealish converted Gabriel Jesus’ pass at the near post to offer Man City a lifeline. Both sides traded chances as the half wore on and it was City who got their second goal in the 90th minute when Bernardo Silva tapped into an empty net from a rebound. Man City fashioned two chances to level but Liverpool held on to claim a 3-2 victory that sends them into the FA Cup final, the club’s first since Klopp became manager. Liverpool await the winner of the second semi-final between Chelsea and Crystal Palace to know their opponents in the final.
