Nasir el-Rufai, governor of Kaduna, has announced that the state government has begun negotiating the takeover of the Ahmadu Bello Stadium from the federal government. The governor spoke while meeting athletes and sports teams who won medals for Kaduna state at both local and international sports competitions. He said President Muhammadu Buhari “has agreed in principle” to return the stadium to the state government, adding that the next step is to work out the details “between the ministry of justice and the ministry of youths and sports”. El-Rufai said the Kaduna government has also embarked on the “major redevelopment” of the Ranchers Bees Stadium. ‘’Mr President has agreed in principle to the transfer of Ahmadu Bello Stadium back to Kaduna state, and we are working out the details between the ministry of justice and the ministry of youths and sports,’’ he said. “We are also undertaking a major redevelopment and upgrade of the Ranchers Bees Stadium or the Township Stadium, into a modern stadium.’’ The Ahmadu Bello Stadium is one of the oldest stadia in Nigeria and was designed in 1965. With 16, 000 capacity, the stadium has hosted several games involving the national teams and two FIFA tournaments — 1999 under-20 World Cup and 2009 under-17 World Cup.
