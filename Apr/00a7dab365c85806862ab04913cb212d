Yahaya Bello, governor of Kogi, who is currently seeking to run for president, says he is confident he will secure the presidential ticket of the All Progressives Congress (APC). The governor said this on Saturday in response to a question at the ongoing second GYB annual seminar for political and crime correspondents and editors. On April 2, Bello declared his intention to run for president, adding that he would build on the successes recorded by President Muhammadu Buhari’s administration. Speaking on Saturday, the Kogi governor said all indicators pointed to the fact that he is in the best position to win the 2023 presidential election for the APC. “To answer your question on whether I am scared of other contestants for the presidency. You mentioned asiwaju Bola Tinubu and others. I will say ‘no, I am not scared of anybody in the contest for the APC presidential ticket’,” he said. “Tinubu and others are founding members of the APC, but foundation is not enough. I will defeat all the other aspirants because I have all it takes to be a champion. My performance in Kogi state will speak for me.” The governor also claimed that there are over 16 million Nigerians waiting to vote for him in the 2023 general election.
