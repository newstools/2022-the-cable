Vice-President Yemi Osinbajo will not declare for the 2023 presidential race on Thursday. According to sources close to Osinbajo’s camp, the vice-president has not made any plan to declare for the 2023 presidency on the said date as reported by some media platforms. On Tuesday, some news reports had claimed Osinbajo will formally declare to contest in the next election under the platform of the ruling All Progressives Congress (APC). In February, Laolu Akande, Osinbajo’s spokesperson, said his principal has not taken a decision on contesting the presidency in 2023. “The VP continues focusing all his attention on the work of this administration and on supporting Mr. President in every possible way. Please continue to ignore the speculations,” Akande had said. Ahead of the general election, several groups have asked the vice-president to run for president. In January, youth groups under the umbrella of the National Coalition of Youth and Students (NACOYS) asked the vice-president to declare for the 2023 race. In February, a group called the Concerned Citizens of Nigeria launched an online petition urging Nigerians to persuade Osinbajo to contest the presidency in 2023.
