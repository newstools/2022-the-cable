Peter Obi, a former governor of Anambra and presidential hopeful, says there will be no Nigeria if the country’s problems are not tackled soon. Speaking on Wednesday when he paid a visit to Godwin Obaseki, Edo governor, Obi said Nigeria needs someone who is conversant with the problems confronting the country. The presidential hopeful seeking to contest on the platform of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) said citizens need to make sacrifices to build a better country for the future generation. “As you know I’m one of those aspiring to serve this country. We need to all make sacrifices to build a better nation for our children,” he said. “You need someone who is conversant with the enormity of the problems besieging this country today. If not aggressively tackled from 2023, this country will not be there for all of us.” In his remarks, Obaseki said Edo remains committed to efforts that strengthen the unity of the country. “His excellency, governor Peter Obi, has come to talk to us and consult with us in Edo on his aspiration to be president of Nigeria. As you know, Edo is the heartbeat of Nigeria. For us in Edo, it is about Nigeria first,” he said. “Whatever we are doing politically must be one that will strengthen and preserve our country and our view is that this country Nigeria cannot be sustained and preserved if there is no fairness because we need that unity. “We need to realise that as a country, we all must all feel part of this country and have access and opportunities like anyone of us. Anything that is not inclusive, Edo is not part of it. Edo wants to build a strong united country.”
