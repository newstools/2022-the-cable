Ibikunle Amosun, senator representing Ogun central, says he will officially declare his bid to run for president on May 5. Amosun said his experience in private and public life has vested in him the requisite experience to be president. “It is with the greatest respect that I write to notify you and my distinguished colleagues of my intention to contest for the office of president of our dear country, the federal republic of Nigeria and to respectfully invite you and my distinguished colleagues to the formal declaration ceremony,” the former governor said in a statement. “I have been blessed by God to serve as Senator of the Federal Republic of Nigeria between 2003 and 2007 and as a two-term Governor of Ogun State between 2011 and 2019. “I have also had the privilege to be elected a second time to the Senate of the Federal Republic in 2019 where I currently serve the good people of Ogun Central Senatorial District. “My varied experience in private and public life has imbued me with requisite insights, experiences and network of relationships adequate to provide a leadership that will galvanize our dear country to achieve her manifest destiny as leader in Africa and of the black race.” The senator said his declaration will be held at Shehu Musa Yar’Adua centre located in the Central Business District (CBD) of Abuja at 11:00am. “I seek the prayers of all of you for a successful declaration ceremony, victory at the party primaries and the 2023 presidential election,” he said.
