Labaran Maku, former minister of information, has declared his intention to contest the governorship of Nasarawa on the platform of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP). Maku announced his intention on Saturday in Lafia, the Nasarawa capital, when he led his supporters to inform the PDP state working committee (SWC) of his return to the party. The former minister, who until his recent return to PDP was the national secretary of the All Progressives Grand Alliance (APGA), apologised to party members for leaving since 2015. He spoke on his commitment to the party before his defection to APGA following dissatisfaction with the outcome of the 2015 governorship primary of the PDP, adding that he could not justify his leaving the party. Maku then announced his governorship ambition, and promised to accept the outcome of the party’s primary. He also said he would work with whoever picked the party’s ticket, adding that the state had suffered from “bad governance, poor performance and total neglect in the last 12 years”. “We are on a rescue mission under PDP,’’ he said. In his remarks, Francis Orogu, PDP chairman in Nasarawa, expressed joy at Maku’s return, and said the leadership of the party had been working since 2019 to bring him back to the party. While assuring party members that a level-playing ground would be provided for all aspirants, Orogu commended Maku for “speaking truth to power”.
