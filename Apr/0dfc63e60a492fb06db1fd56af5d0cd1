President Muhammadu Buhari has advised Nigerians against allowing themselves to be used to promote disunity in the country. The president spoke on Tuesday during an iftar he hosted for governors, ministers and heads of government agencies. According to a statement by Garba Shehu, presidential spokesman, Buhari advised Nigerians to “resist agents” who want to destabilise the country. “We have the land, we have the resources, and we have the people. But I do not know why people will allow themselves to be successfully subverted to destabilise their own country,” he added. The president also expressed confidence that in spite of the current security challenges, the country will overcome. Speaking on the 2023 general election, he said he was a beneficiary of free, fair and credible polls, adding that the introduction of technology for elections will make it impossible for anyone to claim millions of votes. Kayode Fayemi, chairman of the Nigeria Governors’ Forum (NGF), who attended the dinner, was quoted as commending the president for demonstrating resilience and determination at a crucial period in Nigeria’s history. ‘‘We have a leader who is not distracted by momentary challenges but has continued to commit to the renewal of our nation and we, governors, ministers and heads of government agencies are equally dedicated to building a better Nigeria on your watch,’’ he was quoted as saying.
