The Ebonyi police command says one Christian Iboko, an operative of the Ebube Agu security network, has been killed by gunmen. Loveth Odah, the command’s spokesperson, said the 26-year-old Iboko was killed on Thursday night. Odah said the deceased was trailed and killed at his family house in Nduogbuovu community, Izzi LGA of Ebonyi. The police condemned the killing and described it as “unfortunate and wicked”. “The command has started an investigation into the incident and a serious manhunt has commenced to ensure that the perpetrators of such a heinous crime are brought to book,” she said. “The Commissioner of Police, Mr Aliyu Garba, has ordered a serious manhunt in the area. I assure you, our officers will work round the clock to arrest those involved.” Another Ebube Agu personnel had earlier been killed in his house in Ezza north LGA of the state on March 23. In January, an operative of the security network was beheaded by gunmen in his home. The police later arrested two persons over their alleged involvement in the crime.
