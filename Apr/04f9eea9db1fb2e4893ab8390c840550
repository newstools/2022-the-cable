Manir Dan’iya, deputy governor of Sokoto, has declared his intention to contest the governorship of the state in the 2023 general election. He announced his intention in a statement issued on Friday. According to the statement issued by Aminu Abubakar, his media aide, the deputy governor said he would build on the achievements of Aminu Tambuwal, current governor of Sokoto. “With utmost humility and Allah’s will, I formally declare my intention to run for the office of Governor, Sokoto State, on the platform of our great party, the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP). I seek your support,” the statement quoted the governor as saying. The deputy governor also expressed his appreciation to his supporters and party loyalists in the state. Prior to winning the election alongside Tambuwal on the platform of the PDP in 2019, Dan’iya had replaced Aliyu Ahmed as Sokoto deputy governor following the resignation of the latter in November 2018. Ahmed had resigned to contest as the deputy governorship candidate of the All Progressives Congress (APC) in the 2019 general election. In March 2019, the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) declared Tambuwal as winner of the governorship election in Sokoto state. According to INEC, Tambuwal polled a total of 512,002 votes to beat Ahmed who got 511,660 votes.
