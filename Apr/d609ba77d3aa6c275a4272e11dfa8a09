Muhammad Sa’ad Abubakar, the Sultan of Sokoto, has confirmed the sighting of the moon signalling the beginning of Ramadan. In a live broadcast on Friday, Abubakar announced that the Ramadan fast will begin on Saturday. The Nigerian Supreme Council for Islamic Affairs (NSCIA) also announced the development in a statement on Friday. “Assalamu Alaikum Wa Rahmatullah, Alhamdu Lillah, the crescent of Ramadan 1443H has been sighted at some locations in Nigeria . Tomorrow 2nd April, 2022 is 1st Ramadan, 1443,” the statement reads. The development comes hours after Saudi Arabia announced the sighting of the moon. The Ramadan month is a time for reflection, contemplation, and celebration when Muslims around the world observe fasting for 29 or 30 days. Fasting during the holy month is one of the five pillars of Islam, and during the period, Muslims abstain from eating, drinking, and any form of sexual relationship from dawn till dusk. Muslim faithful are also encouraged to perform prayers, seek forgiveness and engage in humanitarian activities. Fasting in Ramadan is compulsory for all adult Muslims, except if an individual is sick, travelling, observing menstrual cycle, pregnant, or elderly. The Islamic calendar follows the phases of the moon, known as the lunar cycle, falling nearly 10 days earlier every year in the Gregorian calendar.
