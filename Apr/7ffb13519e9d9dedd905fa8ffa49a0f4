A coalition of women groups has called on the federal government to “comply immediately” with the court ruling on implementation of 35 percent affirmative action policy. On April 6, TheCable had reported that a federal high court in Abuja ordered the federal government to implement its 35 percent affirmative action policy on public service positions. In a statement issued on Friday, the women said the federal government has no excuse to waste time on implementing the court ruling. “The landmark judgment which upheld and mandated the implementation of the provisions of the national gender policy (2006) on 35 percent affirmative action in appointive positions is worth celebrating,” the statement reads. “The court also upheld the equality of the sexes and the constitutional mandate to recognise this in all appointive positions. This indeed is long overdue. In effect, it clearly means that Nigerian women are now accorded 35% affirmative action as a matter of right in line with democratic ethos. “Across the world, especially in Africa, women are emphatically rejecting inequality which can no longer be tolerated and that clearly means taking into consideration every measure, including legal action to get what women deserve. “With this victory, we demand immediate implementation of the judgment of the court. We call on the government to set up implementation framework for the enforcement of this landmark ruling. “We demand all parastatals, agencies and ministerial appointments to henceforth be in compliance with the 35 percent affirmative action.” Women groups signatory to the statement include: Nigerian Women Trust Fund (NWTF), Women Empowerment and Legal Aid (WELA), Centre for Democracy and Development (CDD-West Africa), Women Advocates Research and Documentation Centre (WARDC), and Vision Spring Initiatives (VSI). Others are Women in Politics Forum (WIPF), YIAGA Africa, International Federation of Women Lawyers (FIDA), and the 100 Women Lobby Group.
