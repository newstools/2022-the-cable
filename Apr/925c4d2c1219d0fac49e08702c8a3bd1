We provided good plumbing system to enable uninterrupted water supply, replaced the water cosets, carried out a complete facelift of the toilet environment to make it standard for use” Chidera stated. <img class="alignnone wp-image-687283" src="https://f5p3e9e4.stackpathcdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/Screenshot_20220414-143327_Office.jpg" alt="" width="550" height="354" srcset="https://f5p3e9e4.stackpathcdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/Screenshot_20220414-143327_Office.jpg 994w, https://f5p3e9e4.stackpathcdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/Screenshot_20220414-143327_Office-300x193.jpg 300w, https://f5p3e9e4.stackpathcdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/Screenshot_20220414-143327_Office-768x494.jpg 768w, https://f5p3e9e4.stackpathcdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/Screenshot_20220414-143327_Office-24x15.jpg 24w, https://f5p3e9e4.stackpathcdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/Screenshot_20220414-143327_Office-36x23.jpg 36w, https://f5p3e9e4.stackpathcdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/Screenshot_20220414-143327_Office-48x31.jpg 48w" sizes="(max-width: 550px) 100vw, 550px" /> Mr. Megwa Edwin, the State Coordinator, Lagos NYSC said “I’m particularly excited today, as this is a project, we all have been looking out for, seeking help from corporate organizations for over one and half years, which continuously proved abortive. Then, Hypo came in unsolicited to bequeath us with these unique gifts. We can’t thank the management enough. Currently more than 2,000 corp members have registered as volunteers under the toilet rescue project and are working hard to effect change in schools who don’t have decent toilet facilities, updates on this shall be provided in due time.
