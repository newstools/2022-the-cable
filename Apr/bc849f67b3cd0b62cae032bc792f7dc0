Mohammed Abba Aji, a former senator representing Borno central, says Bola Tinubu, a chieftain of the All Progressives Congress (APC), should support Vice-President Yemi Osinbajo for the presidency. Osinbajo declared his intention to contest the presidency on Monday, while Tinubu, on January 10, announced his intention to run for the same office after he a visit to President Muhammadu Buhari. Speaking with journalists in Abuja, Aji said Tinubu should back Osinbajo for the presidency because the vice-president has many supporters across the country. “Asiwaju is a great leader of our party and his role in bringing about an Osinbajo vice-presidency has been vindicated, having performed creditably, impressing President Buhari and millions of Nigerians,” he said. “As a leader, when you have brought a great idea, you should allow such to grow and Vice-President Osinbajo’s declaration for the 2023 presidency is a reflection of very sound growth and the next step is for Osinbajo to assume the presidency in 2023. “I have been in politics since the early 80s and I can tell you that the Nigerian electorate is now much wiser, much more discerning and sophisticated than what you had in the past. “The spontaneous rallies are a show of strength, asserting the power of the real people and it is a strong pointer to professor Yemi Osinbajo’s very bright chances for ultimate electoral victory.” Aji had dumped the APC in 2018 to contest for a seat on the senate on the platform of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP). He, however, lost the election to Ibrahim Shettima, former governor of Borno who is the current senator representing Borno central.
