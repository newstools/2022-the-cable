President Muhammadu Buhari says he does his best to avoid interacting with judges in order to avoid the assumption that he interferes with judiciary matters. The president spoke at an iftar he organised for the leadership of the judiciary on Thursday evening. According to a statement by Garba Shehu, presidential spokesman, Buhari also reassured the judges that the executive arm of the government will continue to respect the judiciary within the boundaries laid out in the constitution in order to strengthen the country’s democracy. “I assure you that I have tremendous respect for the judiciary. Order and discipline can only be established when the law applies to all, irrespective of position or status, who you are or who you like and without fear or favour,” he was quoted as saying. “I try to keep my distance from you to avoid the perception of interference.” According to the statement, Ibrahim Muhammad, chief justice of Nigeria (CJN), said Buhari has never asked a favour from the judiciary. “In all your years in office, at no time, no moment did Mr. President or any other person from you attempt to talk or ask for favours from the courts,” he was quoted as saying. “We can recall no such attempt by you or anyone on your side to interfere with judicial decisions. “This is a mark of your maturity and sagacity. I am convinced that as you do with the judiciary, so is the case with ministries and other agencies of government. “With leaders like you who do not interfere with judicial decisions, the country can rest assured that all is well.”
