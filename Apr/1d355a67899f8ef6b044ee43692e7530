Afe Babalola, founder of Afe Babalola University, Ado Ekiti, says the 2023 elections will produce “recycled leaders” if held under the 1999 constitution. Speaking at a media briefing on Monday in Ado-Ekiti, the capital of Etiki, the senior advocate of Nigeria (SAN) said politics has become a “lucrative” enterprise in Nigeria. According to NAN, Babalola said instead of holding elections in 2023 when President Muhammadu Buhari’s term ends, an interim government should be formed to steer Nigeria in a new direction. He said the 2023 elections should be suspended, while an interim government should be in office for six months to develop “a new-look peoples’ constitution which should provide for part-time legislators and non-executive president”. According to him, members of the interim government should be selected from previous presidents and vice-presidents, ministers and governors, as well as delegates of prominent professional associations. “The same constitution has made politics become not only very attractive but the only lucrative business in Nigeria today,” he said. “What this means is that any election that holds under the present scenario will end up producing transactional and recycled leaders, with no ability to turn things around. “The new constitution should also provide that there shall be no salary, but sitting allowances only for lawmakers. It should provide a true federal system of government, instead of the expensive presidential system of government. I suggest a parliamentary system of government with a unicameral legislature. “The new constitution should also provide a body at the local, state and federal levels to screen all aspirants on the sources of their wealth and means of livelihood.”
