Chukwuma Soludo, governor of Anambra, has sworn in 20 new commissioners for the state. The swearing-in ceremony held on Saturday at the executive chamber of the Anambra government house. Speaking on the event in a statement, the governor said the decision to conduct the swearing-in on Saturday was because he believes there are no off-days in governance. “This is the third week since I was sworn in as the Governor of Anambra State. In line with my promise to the people and the constitution of the Federal Republic of Nigeria, 20 commissioners have been sworn in today after going through the statutory screening at the state assembly. The 21st commissioner will also be sworn in next week after being cleared by the house of assembly,” the statement reads. “This is happening on a Saturday, unusually so because the business of Anambra under my watch can be carried out 24/7. “To all my newly inaugurated commissioners, I congratulate them all as well as commiserate with them. This is a call to action. The challenges are humongous! “They all offered to serve, and were selected from a very competitive pool of over 1000 applicants. As they all came knowing the Ministry they have been assigned to; this means they were selected and are fit-for-purpose for the huge task ahead. “I’m not a fan of the “100 days in office” frenzy, as I recognise that it is a four year bout that must be benchmarked to appraise performance. I, therefore, have charged them all with a 50 days in office delivery plan. We will be exerting because the Anambra people cannot wait. What this means is that we expect nothing but excellence – that is the Anambra spirit.” Ben Chiobi, a retired officer of the Nigerian Air Force (NAF), was also sworn in as the special adviser to the governor on security. Below are the details of the 20 new commissioners.
