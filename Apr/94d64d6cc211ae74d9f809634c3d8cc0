Rochas Okorocha, former governor of Imo, has asked the federal government to set up a judicial panel to investigate the recent fire incident at an illegal oil refinery in the state. He said this in a statement issued on Sunday by Sam Onwuemeodo, his special adviser on media. On Friday, a reported explosion occurred at an illegal oil refining site in Ohaji/Egbema area of Imo state, with at least 100 people reported to have been burnt to death. The development comes amid concerns by stakeholders on the effects of oil bunkering across the country. Okorocha, now senator representing Imo west district, described the incident as “worrisome and disheartening”. “Orlu zone has been in the news for the wrong reasons. The ugly and disturbing stories of killings or deaths in the zone have become unbearable,” he said. Okorocha, therefore, called on Timipre Sylva, the minister of state for petroleum, to immediately set up a judicial panel of inquiry to unravel the “remote and immediate causes” of the incident, with a view to averting future occurrence. The former governor also “prayed for God to console the families affected by this disaster and give the souls of all those who lost their lives in the incident, eternal rest”. Meanwhile, President Muhammadu Buhari has directed security agencies to “intensify” the clampdown on sponsors of illegal refineries across the country. The president has also asked security operatives to ensure that those responsible for the Imo incident face prosecution.
