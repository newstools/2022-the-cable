The Yobe police command says it has ordered the closure of its mammy market in Damaturu, the state capital. In recent days, some markets where local drinks are sold in some states in the north-east have recorded explosions. Last week, Taraba recorded two such incidents in the state, while the Islamic State in West Africa Province (ISWAP) issued a statement claiming responsibility for the attacks which left six persons dead and several people injured. On Sunday, an unconfirmed number of people were killed and others injured after an explosion rocked a relaxation centre in Abasha ward, Gashua LGA of Yobe state. The attack came days after bars in Geidam LGA of the state were attacked by gunmen. TheCable understands that the mammy market of the police area command in Damaturu has multiple locations where local drinks are sold. Dungus Abdulkareem, police spokesperson in Yobe, confirmed the closure of the mammy market to TheCable on Tuesday. The police spokesperson said the command ordered the closure of the mammy market as a “preventive measure”. “Yes, it has been closed. You know there were attacks on beer parlours where people use to get drinks. One recently happened in Geidam local government area of the state where some people were killed,” he said. “However, following the incident of a bomb explosion which we are suspecting to be improvised explosive devices (IED), our police EOD department went there and analysed it and they found some elements for making bombs. “So, with this development and to avert a future occurrence and with an investigation ongoing, we now decided to close down those places until we curb the situation. “You know you cannot predict issues like these. You have to take measures. It is a preventive measure. It is just a temporary closure pending our investigation.” The police spokesperson added that the market will be reopened when the command “certifies” that it is safe to do so.
