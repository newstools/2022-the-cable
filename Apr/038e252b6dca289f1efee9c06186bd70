Bandits have abducted five students of the College of Health Science and Technology in Tsafe area of Zamfara state. The students were reportedly abducted in the early hours of Wednesday. The bandits invaded the residence of the students –a private hostel– situated outside the school campus. Mohammed Shehu, spokesman of the command, confirmed the incident to TheCable. He, however, said one of the victims escaped from the abductors. “It is confirmed. The students were abducted at the outskirt of the town in their residence,” Shehu said. “One of them escaped, remaining four students. The police in collaboration with sister agencies have commenced a search and rescue mission to get the students back.” He added that the bandits are yet to call anyone to discuss ransom. In 2021, abduction of students was rife in the northern part of the country. From Niger, Kebbi to Kaduna, Zamfara, Plateau, scores of students were abducted despite efforts of the state governments and security agencies to curtail the onslaughts. Some of the students were later released by the bandits after negotiations. As part of efforts to curb the menace, schools were closed down in some of the affected states. Residents have also not been spared from the attacks. An expose by TheCable revealed that at least, 821 students were kidnapped within eight months in 2021.
