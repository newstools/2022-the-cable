The convoy of former President Goodluck Jonathan has been involved in an accident. TheCable understands that the auto crash occurred on Wednesday along the airport road in Abuja. Two persons are feared to have died in the accident, but the identities of the deceased remain undetermined. According to sources in Jonathan’s camp, the former president was still in Yenagoa, Bayelsa state capital, as at Wednesday morning. He was said to have travelled to Abuja for an official assignment. The accident is the latest in a long list of road mishaps involving the convoy of political leaders. Most recently in March 2021, a driver was killed in an accident involving the convoy of Inuwa Yahaya, governor of Gombe state. The accident was said to have happened while the governor was returning to Gombe from Bauchi where he had attended a meeting of the North-east Governors’ Forum. In the same month, one of the vehicles in the convoy of Bala Mohammed, governor of Bauchi, somersaulted during a visit to the Tafawa Balewa LGA of the state. A total of 10 police officers were in the affected Toyota Hilux van. Similarly, the convoys of Vice-President Yemi Osinbajo, Godwin Obaseki, Edo state governor, and Babagana Zulum, his Borno counterpart, have also been involved in auto crashes in recent years — with fatalities recorded in all three cases.
