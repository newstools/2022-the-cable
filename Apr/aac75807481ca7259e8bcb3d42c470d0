Presidential hopefuls on the platform of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) from the south-east have asked members of the party from other regions to support a candidate from their zone. The presidential hopefuls — former Senate President Anyim Pius Anyim; Peter Obi, former governor of Anambra; Sam Ohuabunwa and Nwachukwu Anakwenze — spoke on Saturday at a media briefing in Abuja. Speaking on behalf of his colleagues, the former senate president said they will work with party members from other regions to ensure that the PDP presidential ticket is zoned to the south-east in the interest of “fairness and equity”. “It is our knowledge that more aspirants may have obtained forms under PDP. We hope that they will join us a little later,” he said. “So, in the interim, four of us that are presidential aspirants on that platform of our great party, the PDP, met this morning and resolved as follows. “We have agreed to work together as a team. We will work together to ensure that a south-easterner emerges as the PDP flag bearer for the 2023 presidential election. “We intend to consult with other zones on this issue and it is based on fairness and equity. In doing so, it is important to note that we have always supported other zones, and we now expect them to reciprocate.” Anyim said the party’s constitution supports zoning, adding they will stick to their guns on the matter. “In fact, in line with the PDP constitution, we believe that the PDP constitution favours what we are doing and we have to boldly step out with this decision,” he said. The development comes hours after governors of southern states in the PDP insisted that the party’s presidential ticket be be zoned to the south.
