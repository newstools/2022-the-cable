The African Table Tennis Federation (ATTF) has confirmed Lagos as the host of the 2022 African Cup, World Championships regional qualification, and the continent’s club championships. According to a statement from Nigeria Table Tennis Federation (NTTF), the three tournaments will be held at the Molade Okoya-Thomas Hall of Teslim Balogun Stadium from May 19 to 28. The World Championships regional qualification for West African teams will serve off the Games from May 19 to 21, while the African club championships will follow on May 23 to 25. The 10-day contest will then wrap up with the African Cup, which is a singles tournament, from May 26 to 28. Khaled El-Salhy, president of ATTF, said Lagos was chosen to host the tournaments because of the remarkable organisation of previous editions. “Lagos has the best bid to host the African Cup in 2022 together with the African Clubs, as ATTF is always satisfied with the remarkable organisation in Lagos coupled with full capacity of spectators in the venue throughout any major competition,” he said. “The new thing is that the ITTF World Cup may not be held this year, and the other option will be the WTT Cup Finals which will include the same policy that continental cup winners will represent each continent.” Most of the continent’s table tennis stars are expected in Lagos for the African Cup, including Egypt’s Ahmed Saleh and Dina Meshref who will be defending their titles, and Aruna Quadri, who recently became the first African player to reach the semi-final of the WTT star contender event. For the African Cup, each participating country will nominate two players in men’s and women’s events, while the host country will nominate four players each. Meanwhile, ATTF has approved a nine-member main organising committee (MOC) with Wahid Oshodi as the chairman. He would be deputised by Alfred Germain Karou, president of Cote D’Ivoire Table Tennis Federation.
