The National Emergency Management Agency (NEMA) says the death toll from the explosion that rocked an illegal oil refinery site in Abaeze community Ohaji/Egbema LGA of Imo state has risen to 110. The incident occurred on Friday night. Ifeanyi Nnaji, acting head of Imo/Abia operations office of NEMA, said more bodies were recovered in Orashi River, near the scene of the incident on Sunday, and that some died at various hospitals. Nnaji said emergency workers in Imo have been on the ground since the incident occurred to carry out rescue operations and evacuate the bodies. The NEMA chief said arrangements are being made to carry out mass burial of the dead. He added that the cause of the explosion is yet to be ascertained. “Those who should tell the story and give insight to the incident are all dead, we are still on ground, we will soon come out with a report on the incident,” he said. He appealed to the government to create an enabling environment for genuine business to flourish within the oil producing communities in Imo, so as to  discourage youths from engaging in illegal activities. He also appealed to oil companies in the area to assist the government in job creation for their host communities. Following the incident, President Muhammadu Buhari ordered security agencies to intensify the clampdown on illegal refineries. The president also asked security operatives to ensure that those responsible for the explosion are prosecuted. Also, Rochas Okorocha, former governor of Imo, asked the federal government to set up a judicial panel to probe the fire incident.
