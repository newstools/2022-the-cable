The Bala Mohammed Campaign Organisation says the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) needs unity ahead of the 2023 general election. Addressing a press conference in Abuja on Friday, Udenta Udenta, spokesman of the campaign organisation, said the national working committee (NWC) should punish anyone disrupting party’s activities. Udenta said this in reaction to comments reportedly made by Ehigie Uzamere, a former senator. Uzamere had said former Vice-President Atiku Abubakar was the right person to fly the PDP flag at the presidential election — not Mohammed. The Mohammed campaign spokesman said the PDP must prevent party members from using uncouth words toward each other. “PDP does not need this type of acrimony now. We are having a family conversation,” Udenta said. “The PDP must reign in those using uncouth language against other aspirants. We are not sure who Uzamere is working for but enough is enough. “This will be our last studied and restrained response to his unprovoked attack against Sen Bala Mohammed. Next time around we will remove our gloves and go bare-knuckles with such unsavoury individuals and the dark political forces and entities egging them on. “Make no mistake about it, Senator Bala Mohammed’s campaign organisation has the requisite communication skills, robust energy, intestinal fortitude and intellectual depth to take on such sleazy individuals without minding the consequences to party coherence unless the NEC does the needful. “Bala Mohammed holds Alhaji Abubakar Atiku in high regard and is sure Abubakar Atiku also holds Bala Mohammed in high regard and believes strongly that the effort of political clowns and creatures of the night like Uzamere will not damage the respect the two leaders have for one another.”
