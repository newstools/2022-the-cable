The federal government has declared April 15 and 18, 2022 as public holidays to mark the Easter celebration. According to a statement by Shuaib Belgore, permanent secretary in the ministry of interior, Rauf Aregbesola, the minister, made the declaration in Abuja. Aregbesola urged Christians to emulate the attributes of sacrifice, togetherness, forgiveness, kindness, love, peace and patience, “which were the attributes and practices of Jesus Christ, as exemplified by His ministry on earth”. The minister called on Christians and all Nigerians to use the occasion to pray for an end to all security challenges bedevilling every part of the country. He assured that the federal government will leave no stone unturned to ensure that the recent attacks by “undesirable elements” on the highways, airport, and the railway are brought to an end. “Security is everybody’s business. I, therefore, urge Nigerians and foreigners resident in our country to display a high sense of citizenship and public spiritedness at this critical time in the history of our country, by supporting the efforts of all security agencies in bringing peace and security of lives and property of the citizenry,” Aregbesola was quoted as saying. The minister called on Nigerians to join hands with the administration of President Muhammadu Buhari to bring sustainable development and usher in prosperity for all. Aregbesola assured Nigerians that the nation is “inexorably on the path to greatness” despite its present challenges.
