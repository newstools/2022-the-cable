Sunday Dare, minister of youth and sports development, has described Lamidi Adeyemi III, the late Alaafin of Oyo, as a “lover of sports and youth-friendly leader who accommodated everyone without discrimination”. The long-reigning monarch died on Friday night at the Afe Babalola Teaching Hospital in Ado Ekiti. He was aged 83 and ruled for over 50 years. Alaafin, who ascended the throne at the age of 31 in 1970, was an amateur boxer during his youth. He was also a boxing enthusiast till his demise. Paying his tribute on Saturday, Dare also described Alaafin’s death as a huge loss, not only to the people of the Oyo state but to Nigeria as a whole. “Oba Lamidi Adeyemi III was a very committed sports lover who promoted boxing and actively participated in it. As a youth-friendly leader who accommodated everyone without discriminating, he will be sorely missed,” the minister said.
