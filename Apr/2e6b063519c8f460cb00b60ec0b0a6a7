President Muhammadu Buhari says it is stupidity to kill innocent people in God’s name. The president said with adequate education, Nigerians now know that the Boko Haram insurgency is neither about religion or ethnicity. Buhari said this while receiving Karin Ahmad Khan, chief prosecutor of the International Criminal Court (ICC), on Wednesday at the state house, Abuja. “God is just. You can’t kill innocent people, and shout; Allahu Akbar (God is great). It’s either you don’t know God at all, or you are simply being stupid,” he said. “To say Western education is unacceptable (Haram) is very fraudulent. That is why we are fighting them, and educating the people. And we are succeeding a lot. “We came to office when things were very bad, but we are educating the people. Education is fundamental. “Religion and ethnicity are out of it. Some people have just made it a lifestyle to cause confusion, destruction and death.” Khan in his remarks said extremism is like cancer, which can spread and recede, adding that what Boko Haram and the Islamic State in West African Province (ISWAP) do is pervasion of religion.
