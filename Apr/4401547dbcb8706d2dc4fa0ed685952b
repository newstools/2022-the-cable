Ahmadu Fintiri, governor of Adamawa, has announced his decision to seek re-election on the platform of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP). Fintiri declared his intention on Monday at the swearing-in ceremony of the newly elected local council chairpersons in Yola, the capital of Adamawa. The governor said he is seeking re-election to continue the developmental efforts recorded by his administration. “It is no longer news that the nomination form for the Adamawa gubernatorial race of our party has been picked for me,” he said. “We have done so much and there is more to be done to better the lots of our people and our dear state. We have built a trusting relationship with the electorates, majority of whom are the masses where our support is derived because our party needs to continue on the path of victory. “After a very wide consultation within our great party and outside it, within the state and outside it, with my family, friends, associates and leaders, I wish to formally inform you that I have accepted to offer myself once again to seek for the endorsement of our great party, the PDP, to carry its flag in the 2023 governorship election. “I believe you can trust me again as you have done before. There is indeed nothing about me that either you or the entire citizens of Adamawa state do not know. And there is nothing on the shelf of your developmental needs that I do not know. “I have started the crusade for reinventing a new Adamawa state, where no one is left behind and nothing is left untouched. We have done so much in physical infrastructure and moving forward, stomach infrastructure will take precedence.” Fintiri was elected as governor in 2019 on the platform of the PDP. He scored 376,552 votes to beat Jibrilla Bindow, candidate of the All Progressives Congress (APC) and incumbent governor at the time, who got 336,386 votes. Meanwhile, Bindow has also declared interest to return to office on the platform of the APC.
