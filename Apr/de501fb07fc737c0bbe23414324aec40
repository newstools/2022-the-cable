Pauline Tallen, minister of women affairs, says if Osinachi Nwachukwu’s neighbours had spoken up about the abuse she was experiencing, her death might have been prevented. The acclaimed gospel singer was alleged to have been a victim of domestic assault perpetrated by Peter Nwachukwu, her husband. Osinachi’s neighbours had told TheCable that her husband would lock her out of the house. They had also said she was “depressed and scared”. Speaking on Monday at an event in Abuja to mark the 30th anniversary of the Sir David Osunde Foundation, Tallen said security is not just the work of those in uniform but the responsibility of everyone within the society. Making reference to Osinachi’s case, she said if evil is seen in the neighbourhood, it should be reported to the police. “Gender-Based Violence is so prevalent — young girls and women are being beaten to death, killed, because neighbours are not speaking,” NAN quoted her as saying. “The vulnerable are not left out. When I was in the gospel singer’s house, when I finished interviewing the children and I came out, then the neighbours had to talk. “I said ‘where were you? If you had reported to the police, if you had spoken, maybe this lady wouldn’t have been dead’. “Somebody could have rescued her. The police would have picked the man before he destroyed her. “We must expose the bad people. We must speak out. We should not speak after the victim has been destroyed or killed.”
