The Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) has released the final list of candidates for the July 16 governorship election in Osun state. In a statement on Tuesday, Festus Okoye, INEC national commissioner and chairman, information and voter education committee, said under section 32(2) of the electoral act 2022, any party that observes that the name of its candidate is missing from the list should notify the commission in writing. Okoye added that the letter on candidates missing from the list must be signed by the party’s national chairman and secretary, and supported with an affidavit to be submitted not later than 90 days to the election. “Furthermore, the attention of parties is drawn to Section 32(3) of the Electoral Act 2022, which provides that failure to notify the Commission shall not be ground to invalidate the election,” the statement reads. “The final list is published in our state and local government offices in Osun State as well as our website and social media platforms for public information as required by law.” The list shows that Ademola Adeleke of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP), Adegboyega Oyetola of the All Progressives Congress (APC), and 13 other candidates — all male — are vying for the governorship position. There are, however, six female candidates vying for the position of deputy governor. Below is the full list:
