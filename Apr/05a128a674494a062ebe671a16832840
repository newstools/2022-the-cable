Abdullahi Adamu, national chairman of the All Progressives Congress (APC), says the ruling party is yet to decide on the zone which will produce its 2023 presidential candidate. Speaking with state house reporters on Friday, Adamu said the APC presidential flagbearer will be chosen at the convention of the party. “I am today privileged to be the chairman of the party. The party is greater than me. The party has not made a decision and I cannot preempt what the party decision will be,” the APC chairman said. “We will come out by the grace of God, at the appropriate time [with] the candidate the convention will choose. I do not want to speculate. “My duty as chairman is to listen to party men, party leaders, stakeholders, to see what is going to be best when the time comes. And I’ve always found it easier and more noble, to get a bridge before I jump to cross it. We are not there yet.” Adamu said the party did its homework before fixing the presidential expression of interest and nomination forms at N100 million. He argued that the party would need funds to maintain itself and finance campaigns ahead of the 2023 polls. “On the issue of cost of forms… we have been listening with rapt attention to the hues and cries, from our lovers, and from our adversaries. We have no regrets whatsoever. We did some homework,” he said. “Over and above that, yes, we are the ruling party. Yes, we need to set examples in what we do. But I ask you, I don’t know which part of the country you come from. If God forbid, your traditional ruler dies today, contestants will go for more than N100 million, it is no news. “We don’t want to continue begging, particularly in an election year like this. So I want to see that we’re able to mobilise sufficient funds to support our efforts to win the election.”
