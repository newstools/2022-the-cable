Gunmen attacked a mosque in Bali Jali village, Bali LGA of Taraba state as worshippers were breaking their fast on Tuesday. Residents said the bandits wreaked havoc in the community and headed for the mosque, where they shot sporadically and abducted victims. Confirming the incident to TheCable, Usman Abdullahi, spokesperson of the Taraba state police command, said one person has been confirmed dead, with seven kidnapped, while several others suffered gunshot wounds. He added that police have held “a crucial meeting” with stakeholders from the communities, which will aid the trailing of the bandits and the eventual release of those kidnapped. “The command is aware of the attack, and this morning, the DPO, LGA chairman and all stakeholders within that area had a crucial meeting mapping ways they can trace the kidnappers and get those people rescued. Officially one was killed, and seven were kidnapped,” he said. Taraba is one of the worst-hit states by the prevailing insecurity in the country. In February, gunmen invaded the home of Peter Jediel, chairman of the Nigeria Labour Congress (NLC) in the state, and kidnapped him after sporadic gunshots. Jidiel’s abduction came two weeks after Salihu Dovo, a local government chairman, was killed by gunmen.
