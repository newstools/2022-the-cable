The United Nations says activities such as illegal wildlife trade and deforestation can hasten the destruction of the planet. The organisation said this in a statement on Friday to mark the International Mother Earth Day, which is celebrated annually on April 22. The Earth Day seeks to remind the world that the earth and its ecosystems provide human beings with life and sustenance, and thus, the healthier the ecosystems, the healthier the planet and people. This year’s theme, ‘Invest in our Planet’, portrays a sense of urgency for people to unite and take measures to preserve biodiversity and protect the planet. “Mother Earth is clearly urging a call to action. Nature is suffering. Oceans filling with plastic and turning more acidic. Extreme heat, wildfires and floods, have affected millions of people. Even these days, we are still facing COVID-19, a worldwide health pandemic linked to the health of our ecosystem,” the UN said. “Climate change, man-made changes to nature as well as crimes that disrupt biodiversity, such as deforestation, land-use change, intensified agriculture and livestock production or the growing illegal wildlife trade, can accelerate the speed of destruction of the planet. “Ecosystems support all life on Earth. The healthier our ecosystems are, the healthier the planet – and its people. Restoring our damaged ecosystems will help to end poverty, combat climate change and prevent mass extinction. But we will only succeed if everyone plays a part. “For this International Mother Earth Day, let’s remind ourselves – more than ever – that we need a shift to a more sustainable economy that works for both people and the planet. Let’s promote harmony with nature and the Earth.”
