One person was killed while nine others were reportedly abducted by gunmen following an attack on Bagodo community in Chikun LGA of Kaduna state. The gunmen were said to have invaded the community located near Kamanzo, on the outskirts of Kaduna metropolis on Monday night. A resident of the community, who confirmed the incident, said the attackers were shooting indiscriminately as they moved from house to house. They were said to have broken into three houses and abducted nine people, while one person was killed. “There was serious confusion among residents of the community as many people fled their homes to Kamanzo for safety,” the resident said. “Everybody was terrified, knowing that these people are well armed and they always come in large numbers. “We have been banking on the mercy of God, because it is like the security agencies have been overwhelmed by the terrorists when you look at the way people are being killed or abducted almost every day.” Mohammed Jalige, spokesman of the Kaduna police command, did not respond to telephone calls when contacted. The development comes amid recent attacks on communities across the state, including an attack on a train on March 28, which left eight persons dead, while 22 persons are feared to have been abducted. Meanwhile, Usman Baba, inspector-general of police (IGP), had ordered the deployment of more operatives to the state following the Kaduna train attack.
