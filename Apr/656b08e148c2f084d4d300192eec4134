Jibrilla Bindow, former governor of Adamawa, has declared his interest to run for a second term in office on the platform of the All Progressives Congress (APC). Bindow was governor of Adamawa between 2015 and 2019 before losing to Ahmadu Fintiri of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP). Speaking with journalists in Yola, the Adamawa capital, on Monday, the former governor urged other persons seeking to contest to give him a chance to complete what he started. He said if elected, Adamawa people would witness more development in the state. “I did a lot in the state when I was governor and I have many plans for the state, if hopefully reelected in 2023,” NAN quoted him as saying. On his part, Ibrahim Bilal, chairman of the APC in the state, said all the APC governorship hopefuls should be united in winning the state at the general election. “We want you to understand yourselves and unite for the progress of the party ahead of 2023 general election,” Bilal said. In August 2021, Bindow and some APC members were grilled by the Department of State Services (DSS) for allegedly insulting President Muhammadu Buhari. An audiotape of the meeting was leaked to the media, and the DSS invited the key participants of the meeting for questioning. But Sadiq Abdullateef, media aide of the former governor, dismissed reports that his principal insulted Buhari. Abdullateef added said Bindow condemned those making incendiary comments against the president at the said meeting.
