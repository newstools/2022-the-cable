Over the weekend, an image showing Peter Obi, presidential aspirant of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP), wearing a cap with an insignia popularised by Bola Tinubu, a presidential aspirant in the All Progressives Congress (APC), was circulated on social media platforms. The image was mostly shared on Facebook and WhatsApp. Some social media users had claimed Obi, a former Anambra governor, wore the cap to an event. Netizens who shared the image also claimed that the former Anambra governor is now supporting Tinubu’s presidential ambition. A Facebook user identified as Olaore Taiwo posted the image with the caption, “Peter Obi is officially BATIFIED. He loves Asiwaju Tinubu’s Cap.” “Batified”, coined from the initials of Tinubu’s names, loosely translates as someone who has been initiated to support the APC chieftain. A Facebook user identified as Omotayo Adetola Ogunro also posted the image with the caption, “Peter Obi is also batified by putting on Asiwaju’s cap. Asiwaju Bola Ahmed Tinubu’s cap is now what people are wearing.” Another user wrote: “Peter Obi of PDP attended a public function with Tinubu cap on his head No be juju be that. E go shock you in 2023.” <img class="alignnone size-large wp-image-690984" src="https://f5p3e9e4.stackpathcdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/IMG-20220425-WA0004-585x1024.jpg" alt="" width="585" height="1024" srcset="https://f5p3e9e4.stackpathcdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/IMG-20220425-WA0004-585x1024.jpg 585w, https://f5p3e9e4.stackpathcdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/IMG-20220425-WA0004-171x300.jpg 171w, https://f5p3e9e4.stackpathcdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/IMG-20220425-WA0004-14x24.jpg 14w, https://f5p3e9e4.stackpathcdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/IMG-20220425-WA0004-21x36.jpg 21w, https://f5p3e9e4.stackpathcdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/IMG-20220425-WA0004-27x48.jpg 27w, https://f5p3e9e4.stackpathcdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/IMG-20220425-WA0004.jpg 617w" sizes="(max-width: 585px) 100vw, 585px" /> <img class="alignnone size-large wp-image-690985" src="https://f5p3e9e4.stackpathcdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/IMG-20220425-WA0005-576x1024.jpg" alt="" width="576" height="1024" srcset="https://f5p3e9e4.stackpathcdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/IMG-20220425-WA0005-576x1024.jpg 576w, https://f5p3e9e4.stackpathcdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/IMG-20220425-WA0005-169x300.jpg 169w, https://f5p3e9e4.stackpathcdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/IMG-20220425-WA0005-13x24.jpg 13w, https://f5p3e9e4.stackpathcdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/IMG-20220425-WA0005-20x36.jpg 20w, https://f5p3e9e4.stackpathcdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/IMG-20220425-WA0005-27x48.jpg 27w, https://f5p3e9e4.stackpathcdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/IMG-20220425-WA0005.jpg 607w" sizes="(max-width: 576px) 100vw, 576px" /> HOW GENUINE IS THE IMAGE? TheCable subjected the image to a reverse search and the results showed that the original image was taken during the wedding ceremony of Obi’s daughter — Gabriella Nwamaka — which took place in Anambra state. In the original image, the former Anambra governor was not wearing any cap. The original image On April 17, Valentine Obienyem, Obi’s spokesperson, shared the real image on Facebook as part of activities from the wedding ceremony. Multiple media reports used the original picture as a featured image for news stories published on the event. TheCable also subjected the image to an error level analysis on fotoforensics, a platform that provides tools for digital forensics. It showed incoherent colours at the head region of the image. The analysis means that the cap was imposed on the image. The result of the error level analysis can be viewed here. VERDICT The image showing Obi in a cap bearing Tinubu’s insignia was photoshopped.
