Bola Tinubu, APC presidential hopeful, met with 12 governors elected on the platform of the party in Abuja on Monday. TheCable learnt Vice-President Yemi Osinbajo had met with 10 APC governors on Sunday night. Osinbajo announced his intention to run for president in 2023 to the governors at the meeting. On Monday morning, the vice-president publicly declared his presidential bid, saying he would complete the task President Muhammadu Buhari started if elected president. TheCable understands that while 10 APC governors met with Osinbajo, 12 including AbulRahman AbdulRazaq, governor of Kwara state who returned to the country today, met with Tinubu. Tinubu called them for the meeting after they had honoured the invitation of the vice-president. The governors who met with Tinubu are Nasir el-Rufai of Kaduna; Dapo Abiodun of Ogun state; Simon Lalong of Plateau; Abdullahi Ganduje of Kano; Atiku Bagudu of Kebbi; Mai Mala Buni of Yobe; Babajide Sanwo-Olu of Lagos; Hope Uzodimma of Imo; Abdullahi Sule of Nasarawa; Muhammad Badaru of Jigawa, and Gboyega Oyetola of Osun. The support of governors is crucial in elections, particularly in internal contests, as they have influence over the delegates who vote in the primary elections. Tinubu who declared his presidential bid in January will be squaring off against Osinbajo, who is regarded as his ”political son”, in the APC presidential primary election. He will also be going up against Rotimi Amaechi, minister of transportation who is speculated to have Buhari’s blessing — though the president said he is not interested in who succeeds him. <img
