The United States has confirmed its first human case of the H5 strain of bird flu. Bird flu is a condition caused by an influenza virus which is generally observed among wild aquatic birds. It can also infect domestic poultry, other birds, and animals. Bird flu infections in humans, though possible, is rare. They are many strains of bird flu — one of which is the H5 strain. According to a statement on Thursday by the US Centre for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), the H5 case was discovered in a person in the western state of Colorado. The individual was involved in the culling of poultry presumed to have had H5N1 bird flu. The patient reported fatigue for a few days as the only symptom and had since recovered. According to the CDC, the patient is being isolated and treated with the influenza antiviral drug oseltamivir. “This case does not change the human risk assessment for the general public, which CDC considers to be low,’’ the statement reads. “CDC had been monitoring for illness among people exposed to H5N1 virus-infected birds since these outbreaks were detected in U.S. wild birds and poultry in late 2021. “To date, H5N1 viruses have been found in US commercial and backyard birds in 29 states and in wild birds in 34 states. “CDC has tracked the health of more than 2,500 people with exposure to H5N1 virus-infected birds and this is the only human case that has been found to date. “This is the second human case worldwide associated with this specific group of H5 viruses that are currently predominant and the first case in the United States. “The first case internationally occurred in December 2021 in the United Kingdom in a person who did not have any symptoms and who raised birds.” This announcement comes two days after China reported its first human case of the H3N8 strain of bird flu.
