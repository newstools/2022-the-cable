Gunmen have reportedly abducted 10 members of the Miyetti Allah Cattle Breeders Association of Nigeria (MACBAN) in Ogbaru LGA of Anambra state. The incident was said to have occurred at the herders’ settlement in Obene community on Saturday. About 300 cows were reportedly carted away by the gunmen. The attackers are said to have contacted families of the victims and asked for N4 million as ransom. Commenting on the incident, Tochukwu Ikenga, Anambra police spokesperson, told TheCable that the command will spare no effort to ensure that the assailants are brought to justice. “I can assure you that the  Anambra State Police Command, under the leadership of the commissioner of police, CP Echeng, shall leave no stone unturned till the alleged abductors are rescued and return to their families unharmed,” he said. “I put a call to the sarkin following the message he sent to me and I urged him to go to the police station close to him and make a report. This will enable us to do a preliminary investigation, since he claimed that the alleged abductors have made contact with the families. “This will enable the police to plan properly in the investigation and rescue mission of the victims.” The incident is the latest in a string of attacks on communities across the state in recent months. On Wednesday, a police divisional headquarters in Anaku, Anyamelum area of the state, was attacked by gunmen. Though no death was recorded, three operational vehicles in the premises were set ablaze. On April 18, five persons returning from a traditional wedding ceremony were abducted by gunmen in Akpo-Nkpologwu road in Aguata LGA of the state. Days before the abduction of the wedding guests, gunmen attacked a police checkpoint in Aguata LGA, which resulted in three officers sustaining injuries.
