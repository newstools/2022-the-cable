Ibikunle Amosun, the senator representing Ogun central district, has described Lamidi Adeyemi, the late Alaafin of Oyo, as a symbol of unity in the country. The monarch, who died on Friday at the age of 83, ruled the town for 52 years. Speaking on Tuesday when he paid a condolence visit to the late Alaafin’s family in Oyo, Amosun said Adeyemi was always punctual to events, noting that the Yoruba race has lost a lover of peace. “Alaafin represented unity and harmony among all the zones in the country because his relationship cuts across everybody,” he said. “Yoruba has missed one of our greatest reservoirs of culture. Whenever you saw him, you would know that this was the way Yoruba kind should be. “Throughout my eight years as the governor of Ogun state, there was no function I would invite him to that he would come late; he would have been on the seat even before the programme started.” Other persons who visited the family on Tuesday were Niyi Akintola, former governorship aspirant of the All Progressives Congress (APC) in Oyo, and Sharafadeen Alli, former secretary to the Oyo state government.
