Godwin Obaseki, governor of Edo state, says there is no ‘big cake’ to share again in Nigeria. The governor, who hosted some presidential aspirants of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) in Benin on Monday, said the next president must be someone Nigerians can trust to bake another cake. Obaseki said except the PDP rises to the occasion, it may be difficult to fix the country’s problems. “Forty years ago, we had a big cake to share but today that cake has disappeared,” he said. “Whoever aspires to be the president of this country must be somebody that Nigerians are ready to give ingredients to bake a bigger cake for us all. “For us in Edo, we are ready and stand for building a bigger, stronger and better Nigeria as we cannot continue the way we are today. “We are concerned that except PDP comes out and rally Nigerians around, it will be difficult to pull Nigeria back from the brinks. “Things are really bad and difficult for our people. We have never had it this bad. “We have never had the level of the combination of poverty and inflation, as inflation in Nigeria is pushing millions of people into starvation. We also experiencing security challenges. “Many have been kidnapped in Nigeria as we speak and this is not about individual aspiration, but about Nigeria, as we need the country to survive to be able to push our individual aspirations.” The governor said the visiting group is working towards a consensus candidate arrangement, adding that the task of becoming Nigeria’s president is enormous.
