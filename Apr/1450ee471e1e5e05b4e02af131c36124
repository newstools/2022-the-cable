Gunmen, on Thursday, invaded Anguwan Bulus, a suburb in Sabon Tasha, Kaduna state. Three people were said to have been killed while six were injured and 10 others were abducted. The community is said to have been witnessing frequent attacks by gunmen. A community leader in the area who confirmed the attack said the gunmen invaded the area in large numbers around 8:30pm on Thursday, shooting sporadically. “We are in deep trouble in this community. This is about the fourth time our community is being invaded by these bandits,” he said. “They came around 8:30pm and started shooting. Some people were able to run to Sabo for safety. They killed three people and injured six others. “I don’t know how many people they kidnapped, but I can confirm that I know of 10 people that were taken.” According to him, many people who escaped from their homes were yet to come back, “so it is difficult to determine the exact number of people that were kidnapped”. The community leader said throughout last night residents did not sleep as they were apprehensive. “We were helpless, everybody was tense and agitated. We were at the mercy of the bandits because they were many and they were carrying sophisticated weapons,” he said. When contacted, Mohammed Jalige, the state police spokesperson, said he would get back to TheCable when he has information about the incident. The incident comes two days after the attack on the Abuja-Kaduna train where some passengers were killed, with several persons sustaining injuries and an unspecified number of people still unaccounted for. On Wednesday, gunmen invaded the low-cost housing estate in Zaria city, Zaria LGA of Kaduna state, abducting six persons.
