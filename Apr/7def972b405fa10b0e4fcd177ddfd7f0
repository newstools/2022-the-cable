Manchester City overcame ultra-defensive Atletico Madrid in their UEFA Champions League (UCL) quarter-final first leg tie at the Etihad Stadium on Tuesday night. Man City, the dominant side all night, waited until halfway into the second half before they finally pierced Atletico Madrid’s defensive armor, as Kevin De Bruyne scored the only goal of the encounter. City continued to plug away but had to settle for the lone goal victory going into the second leg next Wednesday in Spain. Liverpool scored in both halves to secure a 3-1 win over Benfica for a commanding advantage going into the second leg at Anfield. Ibrahima Konate and Sadio Mane gave Liverpool a two-goal lead that was restored by Luiz Diaz. Darwin Nunez had earlier halved the deficit for Benfica but Liverpool closed out victory to continue their impressive form. RESULTS
