Aisha Buhari, first lady, has asked presidential hopefuls to adopt women as their running mates in the 2023 general election. The first lady said this on Saturday when she hosted presidential hopefuls from various political parties to iftar. The event held at the banquet hall of the presidential villa. Speaking at the iftar, Aisha said considering the voting strength and involvement of women in politics, they should be adopted as running mates in the forthcoming elections. “In fact, it is high time women are adopted as running mates at all levels, considering their voting strength and active involvement in political processes,” she said. “As we approach the 2023 elections with greater hope, I am confident that Nigeria will continue to grow from strength to strength on the pedestal of our democratic tenets.” She also also encouraged the aspirants to ensure that the forthcoming elections are fair and free. Citing the 2015 elections that brought in her husband as president, she said that was a good example to emulate in the 2023 elections. “It was neither contested in the court of law, nor in the court of public opinion,” she said. “Therefore, the greatest end-of-tenure gift that fellow Nigerians can give to the first family is another free and globally-acknowledged fair election come 2023.” At the APC national women conference held in January, the first lady had asked the leadership of the All Progressives Congress (APC) to ensure that women are put in strategic positions in the party. According to her, the participation of women in politics will have a significant impact on the country’s development.
