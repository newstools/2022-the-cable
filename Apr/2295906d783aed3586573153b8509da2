The All Progressives Congress (APC) says it is yet to take a final decision on the schedule of activities for its primaries. Felix Morka, the APC national publicity secretary, disclosed this at a media briefing on Wednesday after a meeting of the party’s national working committee (NWC). Earlier on Wednesday, there were reports circulating indicating dates for the APC’s primaries to elect candidates for the 2023 elections. Speaking on the development, Morka said the party had not concluded its deliberations on the matter. “We discussed the programme for our party’s primaries, looking at the schedule of activities that is to come. I will not be able to give you a run-down of the details of that schedule because that is still in discussion, and we are yet to conclude on a definite plan or timetable or schedule for our primaries,” he said. “But I can confirm that we did have that conversation today. We began it today, but we have not concluded or made any decision.” He added that as soon as the deliberations are concluded, the decision of the party would be made available to the public. On the party’s position on section 84(12) of the electoral act, the APC spokesman said political appointees would be guided by the law on their participation in primaries. “Both the ministers and other appointees and the party’s leadership have excellent counsel and guidance. I am sure everyone involved intends to comply fully with the letters of the electoral act,” he said.
