Anyim Pius Anyim, former senate president, says the country’s most important challenge is related to politics, not the economy. Speaking on Monday at the ‘Greater Nigeria Conference’ held in Abuja, the former secretary to the government of the federation (SGF) said Nigeria needs to get its bearings politically to provide the right environment for the economy to thrive. Anyim, who is seeking to contest the presidency, also said his experience in the civil service has provided him with the skills needed to lead the country. “In this matter, experience, exposure, and knowledge are important. I worked in Abuja for about 33 years and all through my public service career, I served only in the presidency. As secretary to the government, I was the engine room of the presidency. My experience is cognate experience and my exposure is nationwide,” he said. “I usually segment the country’s challenges into three — political, economic and social. I want to tell you that most times, people lift the economic challenges as if it’s the most important thing. I want to emphasise that the most important challenge in the country today is political, which will include leadership. “You have to politically build the country before you build the economy. You have to have a country before you have social cohesion. If I have the opportunity to lead this country, using consensus, I’ll set up a new foundation upon which we’ll build this nation.”
