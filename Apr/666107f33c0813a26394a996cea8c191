Musiliu Akinsanya, chairman of the Lagos state parks management committee, popularly known as MC Oluomo, has promised to support Babajide Sanwo-Olu, governor of the state, for a second term in office. On Monday, the Governor’s Advisory Council (GAC), the highest decision-making body of the All Progressives Congress (APC), endorsed Sanwo-Olu for a second term in office. The development came weeks after the GAC had dismissed speculations that it had endorsed another candidate for the 2023 governorship election. Speaking on the development in a chat with TheCable on Wednesday, Jimoh Buhari, MC Oluomo’s media aide, said his principal will mobilise members of the transport union to support Sanwo-Olu for a second term. “MC Oluomo supports the endorsement of the governor and promised to work for him for the re-election bid,” he said. “MC Oluomo believes that the governor will perform more than his first tenure, because in his first term, the state experienced the COVID-19 pandemic, #EndSARS protest, and others. “Despite all these, the governor still performed well. He has promised the governor three million votes from the union, friends and family members. We are 100 percent for the governor.” In 2018, Tinubu endorsed Sanwo-Olu as the Lagos APC gubernatorial candidate against Akinwunmi Ambode, the then incumbent governor, who was elected on the platform of the party.
