Bala Mohammed, governor of Bauchi state, says launching a presidential bid is not a walk in the park. Mohammed said it is “not easy” to be on a presidential campaign trail while at the same time serving as governor of Bauchi state. The Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) presidential hopeful, however, said he embarked on the mission to “put Bauchi on the map”. He spoke on Friday while hosting members of the Nigerian Labour Union (NLC), media chiefs, and Traders Artisans Association for a Ramadan fast break at the Bauchi government house. The governor said: “This Ramadan has been very beneficial, I apologised that I have not been able to do it the way I did it last year because I have had to run up and down trying to be president and at the same time trying to be governor. “It is not easy to be in all places at the same time but I am doing it for you because we have to put Bauchi on the map. “There are some more eminently qualified people to do governorship and presidency in Bauchi. We hid behind for too long and it is time for us to accept with humility and present ourselves so that we can provide services to this country. “We are going to do it with humility and as democrats, whatever happens, it is to the glory of God.” The Bauchi governor is contesting against sitting governors and top politicians for the presidential ticket of the opposition party. The contenders are Udom Emmanuel, governor of Akwa Ibom; Nyesom Wike, governor of Rivers; Dele Momodu, publisher of Ovation Magazine; and Anyim Pius Anyim, former senate president. Others are former Vice-President Atiku Abubakar, Bukola Saraki, ex-senate president; Ayo Fayose, former governor of Ekiti; and Peter Obi, ex-governor of Anambra state.
