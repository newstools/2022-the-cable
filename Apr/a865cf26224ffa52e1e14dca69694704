The League Management Company (LMC) has banished Kano Pillars to the MKO Abiola Stadium in Abuja. The Kano-based team will play all its home games in Abuja for the rest of the 2021/22 Nigeria Professional Football League (NPFL) season. The development is a sanction for the latest case of fan violence involving Kano Pillars. In a statement issued on Sunday, LMC slammed a nine million naira fine on the club over the breach of the NPFL rules. The club will also have three points deducted from already accrued points. The LMC went a step further with the disciplinary action by banning the Sanni Abacha Stadium, Kano from hosting NPFL games till further notice. The league management body also mandated Kano Pillars to repair or replace the damaged Katsina United FC team bus, which was vandalised by the Pillars fans. Kano Pillars were held 0-0 by Katsina United before the home fans went on a rampage in the 82nd minute of play, disrupting the game and forcing the referee to call for a suspension. The team is currently 13th on the NPFL log with 27 points.
