President Muhammadu Buhari has commiserated with the families of the two Nigerian Air force pilots who died in an aircraft crash. The two officers — Abubakar Alkali and Elijah Karatu — were killed in the aircraft crash which took place at NAF Base, Kaduna, on Tuesday. In a condolence message by Garba Shehu, presidential spokesperson, Buhari described the incident as “unfortunate”, saying the officers risked their lives in their service to the country. “I am shocked beyond words by the demise of these two promising young men who risked their lives in the service of the country,” Buhari said. “There is no reward big enough to pay for the services of these young and dedicated professional airmen in the service of their country.” While extending his sympathies to Oladayo Amao, chief of air staff, and the families of the deceased, Buhari called for more safety measures to forestall “tragic incidents of this kind”. “I welcome the decision by the NAF  authorities to investigate this accident, but I also call on them to publish and implement the recommendations of the reports of past investigations into air accidents, with a view to preventing future tragedies and putting closure to the families and friends of the deceased,” Buhari added.
