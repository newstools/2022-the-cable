The national electricity grid suffered a system collapse on Friday — the third incident in less than one month. The grid had collapsed on March 14 at 10:40am leading to power outage across the country. Barely 48 hours later, the grid collapsed again on March 15, resulting in blackout in communities across states. Confirming the latest development in a statement on Friday, Abdulazeez Abdullahi, head of corporate communication, Kaduna Electric, said the grid collapsed at 6:29pm. “Dear Esteemed Customers, the management of Kaduna Electric regrets to inform you that the current outage being experienced in our franchise states is due to a collapse of the national grid,” the statement reads. “The collapse occurred at about 18:29 pm this evening. Normal power supply shall be restored as soon as the grid is restored. “We sincerely apologise for all inconveniences.” The Abuja Electricity Distribution Company (AEDC) also confirmed the development in a message to its customers on Friday night. “Please be informed that there has just been a national grid collapse causing an outage in our franchise areas,” the message reads. “We apologise for the inconvenience caused and appeal that you bear with us while we await restoration from the TCN. We regret all inconveniences caused.” You can read more on what it means when the national grid collapses here.
