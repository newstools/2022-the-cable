Garba Shehu, presidential spokesman, says Ban Ki-moon, former secretary-general of the United Nations (UN), has commended President Muhammadu Buhari for his “handling” of the country’s security challenges. According to Shehu, the former UN secretary-general spoke in a phone call with Buhari on Monday afternoon. There have been attacks by gunmen across the country in recent months, leading to killings, abductions and destruction of property. Within the past 15 days, there has been an attack on a train, as well as the killing of scores of residents across Kaduna, Benue, Imo, Oyo, Taraba, Anambra, Ebonyi and Plateau states. Speaking on the Monday phone call, Shehu said the president also expressed appreciation to Ban Ki-Moon for his support towards the country’s progress. “President Muhammadu Buhari Monday afternoon spoke to Ban Ki-Moon over the phone and said Nigeria is in full appreciation to the former United Nations Secretary General for his commitment towards the progress and socio-economic development of Nigeria,” the statement reads. “President Buhari reiterated his long-standing respect and admiration for the two-time UN Scribe and thanked him for initiating the call. “Ban Ki-Moon commended the President for his handling of security and related challenges facing the country. “He expressed appreciation for the support of two prominent citizens of Nigeria – Professor Ibrahim Gambari, President’s Chief of Staff and one-time UN Undersecretary General, and Mrs Amina Mohammed, the current Deputy Secretary General – saying that they are among the best he had ever worked with.”
