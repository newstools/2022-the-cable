Passengers abducted during the recent attack on a train in Kaduna have appealed to the government to come to their rescue. After the attack which occurred on March 28, the Nigerian Railway Corporation (NRC) had confirmed eight deaths, while 22 persons were declared “still missing” as of April 3. On April 6, Alwan Hassan, acting managing director/chief executive officer of the Bank of Agriculture (BOA) — one of those declared missing by his relatives — was released, and his abductors had listed the Ramadan season and old age as reasons he was freed. TheCable had also reported that the abductors had reached out to family members of captives to demand various amounts as ransom. In a video obtained by HumAngle on Sunday, some of the victims are seen seated on the floor and surrounded by armed persons in what looks like a large forest area. The BOA MD is also seen in the video, which has more than 20 persons seated on the bare floor. One of the victims who spoke, but didn’t give her name, said she is a staff member of the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) in Kaduna state. “In my own case, I am a staff of INEC in Kaduna state. I am pleading with the government to please come to our rescue,” she said. Joy, another abductee who identified herself as a student of Kaduna State University, asked the government to ensure they are rescued safely. “I’m speaking on behalf of the students. Government should please hear our cry and come to our aid,” Joy said. A woman identified as Gladys, who said she was an “ex-staff of Defence Industries Corporation of Nigeria”, said government should listen to concerns raised by citizens. “What happened on Monday was needless if the government would have a listening ear and accede to what the populace are talking about,” Gladys said. A male victim, identified as Adedeji, said he was on his way to Kaduna for eye treatment when the attack occurred.
