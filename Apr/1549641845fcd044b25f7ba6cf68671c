Tottenham Hotspur played a goalless draw against Brentford in their English Premier League (EPL) encounter at the Brentford Community Stadium on Saturday. The late fixture proved to be a drab affair as Brentford held their more illustrious opponent, who are chasing the coveted fourth position in the EPL. It was the second consecutive league match Tottenham have failed to test the goalkeeper as promoted Brentford further cemented EPL survival in their first year. The draw sees Antonio Conte’s men drop to fifth on the log, two points behind Arsenal, their North London rivals, who defeated Manchester United 3-1 at the Emirates stadium in the weekend’s early fixture. The Gunners took the lead three minutes into the encounter through Nuno Tavares before Bukayo Saka’s penalty doubled Arsenal’s lead on 32 minutes. Cristiano Ronado reduced the lead two minutes later but Granit Xhaka’s 70th-minute long-range strike sealed victory for Mikel Arteta’s side. Manchester City also won 5-1 against hapless Watford to extend their lead at the top to four points over Liverpool who have played a game less. Gabriel Jesus was the protagonist in this encounter, scoring four of the goals. RESULTS
