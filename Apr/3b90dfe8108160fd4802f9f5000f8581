The Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) says it is yet to fix a date for the National Executive Committee (NEC) to deliberate on the issue of zoning for the 2023 presidential ticket. On March 24, the party set up a 37-member zoning committee, led by Samuel Ortom, Benue governor, to decide on whether or not to adopt zoning. The panel has its recommendation to the national executive council (NEC) of the party for further action. Ortom had also dispelled rumours that the panel advised the party to throw open the presidential ticket. The party had also indicated that only the NEC would have the last decision on the contentious issue of zoning after debating the outcome of the committee’s report. Reports on Sunday suggested that the NEC has decided to meet on Thursday to decide on the report of the panel. But Debo Ologunagba, PDP spokesperson, said: “No date has been fixed. When the date is fixed, it will be announced as appropriate.” On Saturday, the party adjusted its timetable and schedule of activities for the 2023 general elections. It extended the last day for the purchase of all forms to Tuesday, April 19, 2022, and extended the submission of already completed forms to Wednesday, April 20, 2022.
