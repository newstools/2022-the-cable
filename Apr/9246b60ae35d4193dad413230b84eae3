Chukwuma Soludo, governor of Anambra, has shown support for two Nigerian brands — Air Peace and Innoson Vehicle Manufacturing (IVM) Ltd. Before his inauguration, Soludo had pledged to prioritise local brands, saying he would only use Innoson vehicles manufactured in Nnewi, Anambra, for official duties. Writing via his official Twitter handle on Thursday, Soludo disclosed that he had taken an Air Peace flight from Abuja to Anambra. Air Peace is owned by Allen Onyema, a native of Anambra state. He added that he would be driven to his home in an Innoson vehicle. “On board an Air Peace flight from Abuja to Anambra, being chauffeured to the homestead in an IVM G80 car, I ask myself what more could better explain ‘Local’ as the new global?” the tweet reads.
