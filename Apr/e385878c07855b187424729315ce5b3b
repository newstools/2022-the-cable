Chelsea scored two second-half goals to stroll to a 2-0 win over Crystal Palace in their English FA Cup semi-final encounter at Wembley Stadium on Sunday. Goals from Ruben Loftus-Cheek and Mason Mount saw the Blues shake off a lethargic first half to overcome Palace, their London rivals. Courtesy of the victory, Chelsea have now advanced to the final of six competitions since Thomas Tuchel took over as manager in January 2021. Coming off the disappointment of crashing out of the UEFA Champions League at Real Madrid in midweek, Chelsea started sluggishly but Crystal Palace could not capitalise, as Edouard Mendy’s save from Cheikhou Kouyate’s shot was the only meaningful chance of the first half. While Kouyate again went close from a corner kick early in the second half, it was Chelsea that drew first blood on 65 minutes, with Loftus-Cheek’s rising half volley from just inside the penalty area nestling into the top corner of the net. Tuchel’s men doubled their advantage 11 minutes later as Mason Mount latched on to Timo Werner’s pass before slotting into the bottom corner to seal the victory. Chelsea have now qualified for a third consecutive FA Cup final, becoming the third club to achieve the feat after Manchester United and Arsenal. The Stamford Bridge side, who have lost the last two finals they featured in, will face Liverpool at Wembley in the final showpiece on May 14.
