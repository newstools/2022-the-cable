Muslim clerics led by Abdulganiy Ajokidero, chief Imam of Oyo town, have performed Islamic burial rites on the remains of Lamidi Adeyemi, Alaafin of Oyo. The monarch died at the Afe Babalola University Teaching Hospital in Ado Ekiti on Friday night. Following the announcement of his death, the imam and other Islamic clerics arrived the palace on Saturday to hold Islamic prayers for the repose of his soul. After the prayers, his body was then taken back to the palace, where traditionalists held final rites for the king behind closed doors. His body was later brought out into the main hall where the late king had received visitors when he was alive. At the time of his death, the Alaafin was 83 years old and had been on the throne for over 50 years — he was the longest-reigning Alaafin. Adeyemi succeeded Alaafin Gbadegesin Ladigbolu II in 1970 and was crowned on January 14, 1971. Yusuf Ayoola, head of the Oyomesi and Bashorun of Oyo, will take over the throne pending the installation of a new Alaafin. Former President Olusegun Obasanjo had, in his condolence message, said the Alaafin had great faith in a united Nigeria and was a promoter of peace. Below is a video of the Alaafin’s remains being conveyed to the palace.
