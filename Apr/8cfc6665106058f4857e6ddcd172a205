The Chartered Institute of Bankers of Nigeria (CIBN) has elected Kenneth Opara as its new president. Opara, who is the the 22nd president/chairman of the council of the institute, was elected on Saturday. He was elected alongside seven other members during the institute’s 2022 annual general meeting (AGM) held in Lagos. He will succeed Bayo Olugbemi, whose two-year tenure will end on May 21. Speaking on his new position, Opara said he is ready to give his best to deliver the mandate given to him by the institute. “I wholeheartedly accept the mandate to serve as the 22nd president and chairman of the council of CIBN,” NAN quoted him as saying. “I am mindful of the fact that you have high expectations for me and my colleagues. Let me assure you that we shall collectively do our best to deliver on your mandate as an obligatory innovator and implementer. “We will leverage what the past president has done and also look on how to build capacity, collaborate with the stakeholders, and work with other regulators and the banks to ensure that we make a perfect and meaningful competition. “I thank the electoral officer and I congratulate all the candidates. I want to say that we are all winners; no victor no vanquished.” Speaking on the 2021 operations, Olugbemi, outgoing president of CIBN, said the institute contributed significantly to the promotion of banking education and professionalism within and outside Nigeria. Olugbemi said the number of individual members grew from 144,922 as of April 30, 2021 to 149,967 as of March 24, 2022 — representing an increase of 3.5 percent.
