Nse Ekpenyong, a member of the house of representatives, is dead. An aide to the lawmaker confirmed his death to TheCable on Monday. The legislator reportedly died on Saturday. The circumstances surrounding his death are still sketchy. Ekpenyong, who represented Oron/Mbo/Okobo/Udung Uko/Urue Offong/Oruko federal constituency of Akwa Ibom, was a member of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP). He was a former member of the Akwa Ibom state house of assembly and the ex-state deputy chairman of the PDP in the state. In 2017, he was arraigned at the federal high court, Uyo, Akwa Ibom state by the Economic and Financial Crimes Commission (EFCC) over allegations of certificate forgery. Ekpenyong’s death comes about eight months after the demise of Adedayo Omolafe, a member who represented Akure north/south federal constituency. Omolafe was the fifth lawmaker to have died in the house of representatives in 2021 and the seventh in the ninth assembly. He died four months after the passing of Suleiman Aliyu, a member of the green chamber from Kaduna state.
