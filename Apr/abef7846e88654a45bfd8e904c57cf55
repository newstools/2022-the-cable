The Nigeria Centre for Disease Control (NCDC) says the outdoor use of face masks is no longer mandatory. Speaking on Friday during an interview with NAN, Ifedayo Adetifa, director-general of NCDC, said the use of face masks indoors and in other high-risk settings such as public transport is still recommended. “As vaccination coverage rises in countries, relaxation of COVID-19-related restrictions including mask mandates is increasing,” he said. “However, the recent COVID-19 surges in many countries have led to questions of whether face masks should be encouraged or required, and for how long. “Proper mask use reduces the probability of transmission between an individual who is infectious and one who is susceptible to infection and helps protect those with a high risk of infection and severe disease. “Example, the elderly and those with cardiovascular and other disease and particularly in environments with a high risk of transmission – indoors – and where there is crowding.” Adetifa encouraged Nigerians to make use of the opportunity provided by the government to get their COVID-19 vaccine at no cost. “This is our best chance at getting back to normalcy as soon as possible as a country and we must work collaboratively to ensure it is done in the quickest time possible,” he said. Boss Mustapha, chairman of the Presidential Steering Committee (PSC) had recently said the use of face masks outdoors will be based on the discretion of Nigerians. “The PSC continues to strongly recommend the use of face masks in enclosed environments. In open spaces, the use of face masks is discretional,” he said during a COVID-19 briefing.
