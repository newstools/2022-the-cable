Sunday Dare, minister of youth and sports development, has commended the National Youth Service Corps (NYSC) for the establishment of its television and radio stations. The minister paid a courtesy visit to the TV and radio studios at the NYSC headquarters in Abuja on Thursday. Speaking as a guest on NYSC Radio 88.3 FM, Dare described the initiative as a major achievement in the scheme’s history. According to him, the TV and radio stations are crucial to help disseminate authentic information in the era of unregulated social media and rising fake news. “In an era of unregulated social media journalism, we should all be worried about fake news. With the danger posed by misinformation and miscommunication, credible outlets like the NYSC TV and radio are poised to bridge the gap and be a reliable source of authentic information for the youth and the society at large,” he said. “It is gratifying that the visionary behind the establishment of the NYSC scheme, Gen. Yakubu Gowon, had commissioned the TV and radio station and it is enough that he was here to see his vision blossom into what it is right now.” The minister said the stations would broadcast activities of the NYSC across the country with unique information about youth development in various sectors of Nigeria’s socio-economic life. He also enjoined the youth to devote 20 or 30 minutes daily to the radio station with a view to participating in the interactive sessions. The NYSC TV and radio will broadcast on Channel 365 on GoTV and 88.3FM on radio respectively.
