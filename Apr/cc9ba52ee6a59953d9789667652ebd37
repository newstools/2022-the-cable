A soldier and a policeman have been killed following an attack by insurgents on a security post in Borno state. The incident occurred on Monday afternoon along the Molai/Damboa road in the state. The security post is manned by a joint task force made up of military personnel and mobile police officers. The insurgents reportedly seized a military gun truck and ambulance, which they set ablaze as they fled into a nearby bush. The suspected Boko Haram members, who invaded the security post, were conveyed on motorcycles and vehicles and were armed with “sophisticated weapons”. According to information from the military command in the area, aside from the two security operatives who were killed in the attack, a police officer sustained injury. A deployment from the Nigerian Air Force (NAF) later arrived the scene and went after the insurgents who had fled into the bush. Meanwhile, a military source told TheCable that they had received an earlier intelligence that insurgents would carry out some attacks during the week in response to the recent killing of some Boko Haram commanders. The development comes hours after the multinational joint task force (MNJTF) killed 10 Boko Haram commanders in the Lake Chad region. The MNJTF operates in the Lake Chad basin of Nigeria, Chad, Cameroon and Nigeria.
