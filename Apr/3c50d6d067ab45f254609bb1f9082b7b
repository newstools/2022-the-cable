John Okoriko, founder of Solid Rock Kingdom Church, has been abducted by gunmen in Akwa Ibom state. The cleric was reportedly abducted when armed men invaded the church’s headquarters in Ibekwe Akpanya, Mkpat Enin LGA of the state on Tuesday. Odiko Macdon, police public relations officer in Akwa Ibom, confirmed the development to TheCable on Wednesday. Macdon said the Akwa Ibom police command would ensure that the culprits are found and prosecuted. “We have received that report and we are working on it,” he said. The cleric, who preaches frequently over the radio and online broadcasts, concentrates his lectures on human values and God’s kingdom. His abductors are said to be demanding N100 million in exchange for his release. The incident is the latest in the activities of attacks by gunmen in the south-south state. In September 2021, Nelson Effiong, a former senator representing Eket senatorial district, was abducted when gunmen invaded a drinking spot in Uyo. Effiong, however, regained his freedom after close to two months in captivity.
