Valentine Ozigbo, candidate of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) in the 2021 Anambra governorship election, has declared his intention to contest in the state’s south senatorial district election in 2023. Ozigbo declared his intention to contest the senatorial election in Awka on Sunday. The PDP candidate was runner-up in the governorship election won by Chukwuma Soludo of the All Progressives Grand Alliance (APGA) in 2021. He polled 53,807 votes in the election. According to Aziza Uko, his director of media and communications, Ozigbo’s decision to run for senate is in response to the clamour by political associates and people of the district. Uko said after the governorship election, the clamour for Ozigbo to run for the senatorial seat of Anambra south began with youth groups and political blocs in the state. “Mr Valentine Chineto Ozigbo has accepted the call by his people, the people of Anambra south, and influential voices across Anambra to run for the seat of Anambra senatorial district in the senate,” Uko said. “He is well-positioned to clinch the ticket at the PDP primary election slated to hold in May because he is the most popular and widely accepted aspirant.”
