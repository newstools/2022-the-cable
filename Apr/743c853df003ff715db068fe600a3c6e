A federal high court in Abuja has fixed June 2 to hear various applications in a suit seeking the extradition of Abba Kyari, the suspended deputy commissioner of police (DCP). Inyang Ekwo, presiding judge, adjourned the matter on Wednesday, after Pius Akutah, counsel to the attorney-general of the federation (AGF), asked the court for more time to enable parties respond to processes served on them. Akutah noted that he had filed a motion for an extension of time on April 19. Mahmud Magaji, Kyari’s counsel, did not object to the application. The judge then adjourned the matter until June 2 for hearing. On March 23, the matter was stalled following the AGF’s failure to serve court processes on the defendant. Kyari is wanted in the United States over alleged conspiracy to commit wire fraud, money laundering and identity theft. A grand jury had on April 29, 2021, filed an indictment against him with the approval of the US district court for the Central District of California, after which a warrant was issued for his arrest. In July 2021, the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) indicted Kyari in a $1.1 million fraud involving Hushpuppi, the self-confessed international fraudster. The suspended police officer denied the allegation, claiming that his “hands are clean”. In August 2021, Usman Baba, inspector-general of police, received the report of a panel set up to probe the allegation against the officer. The report was thereafter sent to the AGF who then filed an extradition application against Kyari on March 2.
