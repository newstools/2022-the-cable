An improvised ‎explosives device (IED) has been found in Shanono, a community in Rigasa, Igabi LGA of Kaduna state. The IED was reportedly concealed in a bucket at the same spot where another one was discovered the previous day. An anti-bomb squad deactivated the IED in Shanono on Thursday and no one was hurt in the process. Confirming the development, Mohammed Jalige, spokesman of the Kaduna police command, said the IED was deactivated after the police explosives ordnance department (EOD) personnel worked on it. Jalige said the police are working to arrest the suspects who have been planting the devices. The spokesman said five IEDs have been defused by the ordinance department in less than one month. “This morning we found another one (IED) planted in the same spot. With the quick intervention of people in that community, the issue was reported and responded immediately,” he said. “We detailed our explosives ordnance department (EOD) personnel to the area, the suspected IED was diffused. The one we discovered yesterday was also diffused there without causing harm to anybody. “We have intensified efforts with a view of tracing the suspects behind the planting of these IEDs. In less than a month we have diffused about five IEDs.”
