Some youths, on Monday, staged a protest and barricaded the Lagos-Ibadan expressway. The protesters made bonfires on both sides of the road around Berger area, preventing the free movement of vehicles along roads linking to the expressway. They also displayed banners with the inscription: ‘Questions for Politicians and Religious Leaders. What is the Future of Nigeria? All Highways in Nigeria will be [Blocked]. No movement Nationwide’. During the protest, they urged motorists and passers-by to support them. “If you don’t like the way the country is, support us. We are angry. We are the youths. We are suffering. People graduate and can’t get jobs. We are angry,” one of the protesters said. The demonstration lasted for close to an hour before police officers arrived the scene and cleared the road for motorists. Benjamin Hundeyin, Lagos police spokesperson, confirmed the development to TheCable and said two persons were arrested. “The police responded and two people were arrested. They were taken to Ojodu Abiodun police division and the road was cleared and the flow of traffic continued,” he said. “They claimed they are members of the ‘Angry Youths Movement of Nigeria’.” Normalcy has been restored in the area. Meanwhile, the development comes amid security challenges in the country. The most recent incident was an attack by gunmen on a Kaduna-bound train. The train was said to have nearly reached Rigasa, its final stop, when the gunmen struck. According to a statement by the Nigerian Railway Corporation (NRC) on Sunday, eight passengers were killed while at least 22 persons are still missing.
