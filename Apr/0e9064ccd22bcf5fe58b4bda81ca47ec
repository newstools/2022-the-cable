Usman Baba, the inspector-general of police (IGP), says the force will no longer tolerate attacks on police facilities in the south-east. Recently, police facilities have been a soft target for gunmen in the region, resulting in the deaths of many officers. Anambra state has witnessed the most attacks on police facilities in the past few weeks. On Wednesday, gunmen attacked the police divisional headquarters in Anaku, Anyamelum area of Anambra, and set ablaze three operational vehicles in the premises. To stem the wave of attacks, the IGP has ordered the “immediate deployment” of additional operational assets to the police units in the south-east. “Consequently, the IGP has ordered the immediate deployment of additional operational assets to complement officers and men attached to operations to restore peace in the south-east and other launched operations with the aim of flushing out criminal elements who hide under the guise of aggrieved citizens to perpetrate criminal acts,” Muyiwa Adejobi, force spokesperson, said in a statement issued on Thursday. “The IGP warned that attacks on police officers in the line of duty would no longer be tolerated under whatever guise, as the force holds the lives of its personnel sacrosanct, and such unwarranted attacks would be strictly treated in accordance with extant laws. “He equally reiterated the commitment of the force to protection of lives and property while stressing that it is vital to respect the lives and fundamental rights of police officers and other security operatives, in order to enable them advance their sacred mandate of serving and protecting the citizens better.”
