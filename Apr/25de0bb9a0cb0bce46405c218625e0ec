Some gunmen have abducted the wife and daughter of Usman Bamaiyi, commissioner for environment in Plateau state. The gunmen abducted them from the commissioner’s residence located in Mangu LGA of the state. The attack was said to have occurred in the wee hours of Saturday. Bamaiyi was reportedly not home when the intruders struck. The PUNCH quoted a resident of the area as saying the gunmen shot sporadically in the air. “Some heavily armed men came to Gindiri last night around 2:00am. They went straight to the house of the state commissioner for environment,” the resident said. “The sound of gunshots fired by the gunmen was too much. When they eventually left, we discovered that they took the commissioner’s wife away alongside his daughter.” Efforts to reach Ubah Gabriel, spokesman of the police command in Plateau, were not successful but he was quoted as confirming the incident. There have been a number of abductions in Mangu LGA in recent times.
