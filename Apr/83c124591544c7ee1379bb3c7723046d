The home of Cyprian Akaolisa, attorney-general of Imo, has been razed by gunmen. The incident is the second attack on Akaolisa’s building in less than a year. In June 2021, the building was razed but no casualties were recorded. The Imo attorney-general had been sacked over alleged misconduct in 2021, but was recalled after three months, with the state saying the dismissal was done in “error”. Confirming the latest incident on Sunday, Akaolisa said his father’s house was also set ablaze in the attacks which occurred over the weekend. “Through my many years of struggle, I have managed to put a block on another to build a befitting house for my family. My aged father also has a house he built through his sweat. Today, both buildings are in rubble and ashes,” he said. “Firstly, last year, these arsonists burnt my country home in Obibi, Awo-Idemili, Orsu LGA of Imo state for no just cause. This year again, they returned and this time, they perfected the complete burning of even the blocks/bricks. “And last night, to my utter consternation, they levelled my father’s house. This is a house my father built by himself — the life-toil of an aged man. “I wish to put on record that my family house is completely destroyed. This was after they used a truck to cart away all the properties: fridges, TVs, mattresses, generator sets and other household materials.” While condemning the attacks and other acts of violence across the state, he urged stakeholders in Imo to unite against such negative developments in the interest of moving the state forward.
