Akinwumi Adesina, president of the African Development Bank (AfDB), has condoled with the family of Ernest Shonekan, former head of the interim government over his demise. Shonekan died earlier in the month. He was 85. Speaking when he paid a condolence visit to Margaret Shonekan, widow of the former leader, Adesina said Shonekan took over power at a time the country was filled with “turbulence and uncertainty”. The AfDB president said Shonekan had a big heart “who believed in and remained committed to the unity of Nigeria”. “Chief Shonekan straddled the world’s of business, governance, community development, and philanthropy with excellence,” he said. “His immense contributions to and sacrifices for Nigeria will ensure that his memory remains evergreen in the history of Nigeria. “He was always thoughtful, gracious, full of wisdom, with every word sculpted to shape a better pathway for the country.” Adesina prayed that God grant Shonekan’s widow grace, strength, and fortitude to bear the loss. The AfDB president was accompanied on the condolence visit by some of his top aides.
