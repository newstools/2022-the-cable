At least 10 people have been reportedly killed and houses razed after gunmen invaded Atak Mawai village in Zangon Kataf LGA of Kaduna state. A resident told TheCable that the gunmen broke into the neighbourhood at about 3am on Sunday while many villagers were asleep. He said the locals were awoken by heavy gunfire and began running helter-skelter, adding that those killed were set ablaze in their homes. “The bandits came around 3am when the people were asleep. They were shooting sporadically as they went from house to house setting houses ablaze,” the resident said. “We are yet to ascertain the exact number of people killed because many people ran to the bushes, but I can confirm that 10 people were burnt to death in their homes.” He added that the gunmen had left the community before the arrival of security operatives. When contacted, Mohammed Jalige, police spokesperson in Kaduna, said the command had yet to confirm the attack. He, however, promised to release information on the incident soon.
