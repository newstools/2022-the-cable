Babajide Sanwo-Olu, governor of Lagos, says the state has a “bright future”. Sanwo-Olu spoke on Saturday at the New Year service held simultaneously by Christian and Muslim faithful at the Lagos House, Marina. The governor urged his cabinet members to work toward achieving the ‘Greater Lagos’ agenda. He also enjoined members of the state executive council to lead with the fear of God, make good things out of their lives and ensure that people remember them for good things. “Let us open a new chapter and know that the new chapter is about togetherness. They have said to us that we all have a brighter future,” a statement by Gboyega Akosile, chief press secretary to the governor, quoted Sanwo-Olu as saying. “Our state has a bright future. But it is really for us to open our eyes very well and see the bright future. We should connect to God Almighty and ask for His direction in everything we do.” In his sermon, Samuel Abiara, general evangelist, worldwide, Christ Apostolic Church (CAC), told Nigerians, especially the people of Lagos, to shun those he described as prophets of doom. “Don’t listen to prophets of doom against Nigeria, our nation and the leaders. Don’t listen to prophets of doom against Lagos state. The future of Nigeria and Lagos state is bright,” Abiara said. On his part, Obafemi Hamzat, deputy governor of Lagos, said only unity, peace and love can engender prosperity in any society. While assuring Nigerians of a better life in 2022, Hamzat asked all religious leaders to continue emphasising religious tolerance. “It is practically difficult, if not impossible, to achieve prosperity where insecurity permeates in any society. I, therefore, urge every Nigerian to support the government in her quest for socio-economic and political development,” he added. “The THEMES agenda of Sanwo-Olu administration encompasses every aspect of the life of every Lagos resident. Therefore, we solicit the support of everyone so that our noble objectives may be a reality.”
