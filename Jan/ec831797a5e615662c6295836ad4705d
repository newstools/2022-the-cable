Tunde Rahman, media aide to Bola Tinubu, a chieftain of the All Progressives Congress (APC), says the former Lagos governor is in the United Kingdom for “consultations”. TheCable had earlier reported that the APC chieftain travelled to London. There were, however, unconfirmed reports that the former Lagos governor travelled to the UK over ill health. But in a statement he sent to TheCable, Rahman said the presidential aspirant is in “excellent spirits” and speculations about his visit to the UK are “inaccurate”. He said Tinubu travelled to the UK for meetings and consultations, adding that the former governor will return to Nigeria next week. “Asiwaju Tinubu is in fine health and excellent spirits. The speculations in a national newspaper and on social media are just what they are: unfounded and untrue speculations,” he said. “Asiwaju’s trip to the UK is not to rest or because of any illness. While abroad, Asiwaju is maintaining a vigorous schedule of meetings and consultations on a range of important matters. “Whether at home or abroad, the daily schedule of Asiwaju is vibrant and full. Most people couldn’t sustain his high level of activity. “Asiwaju will return to Nigeria next week once this set of meetings and talks abroad are completed.”
