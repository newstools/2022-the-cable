Some members of the All Progressives Congress (APC) in Jigawa have asked the national caretaker committee led by Mai Mala Buni, Yobe governor, to cancel the congress in the state over the alleged non-compliance with the rules in electing party leaders. In a petition dated October 30 and addressed to Buni but seen by journalists on Monday, the APC members accused Badaru Abubakar, Jigawa governor, of hijacking the process. The APC members — listed as Sani Ibrahim Taura, Hafizu Abubakar, Bala Idi Kazaure, Mutari Garba Garki and Saifullahi Muhammad Mudasshir — alleged that the governor “single-handedly” produced Aminu Gumel as chairman of APC in Jigawa and 35 other executive council members. “We, the undersigned and card carrying members of APC, being critical stakeholders of the party in Jigawa state observed with concern how due process and provisions of the constitution of our great party was strangled on 16th October, 2021, in the name of party state congress, Jigawa state chapter,” the petition reads. “We are aggrieved with what was termed as state congress that produced Alhaji Muhammadu Sani Gumel as chairman on the following grounds:  There was no genuine consensus that produced the current leadership of the state executive council because not all stakeholders were carried along or contacted; no nomination forms were offered for sale to any member apart from those installed for consideration by governor of the state, Muhammed Badaru Abubakar. “There was no balanced consideration of interest groups that make up the party architecture in the state in sharing the leadership positions. “In particular, interest groups from defined ANPP, CPC, and AC were not considered. The Governor hand-picked the exco and handed over the party affairs in the state to a crop of people who are not known as grassroot members.” They also alleged that access to the venue of the congresses was restricted in order to prevent them from exercising their franchise as party members.
