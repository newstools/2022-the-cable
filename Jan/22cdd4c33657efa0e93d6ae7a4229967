The Zamfara state government says it has secured the release of 2,155 victims from bandits. Speaking on Sunday, Ibrahim Dosara, the commissioner of information, said the victims were rescued between September 2021 and January 2022. Dosara said the effort was achieved through collaboration with security forces deployed in the state. He said the rescued victims, including school students, women, and children, had since been reunited with their loved ones. “We wish to register our deep appreciation to the military for upping the ante in recent times,” he said. “The various military operations, the latest being that of Gando Forest, have displaced the terrorists operating along the various axis and significantly degraded their capabilities. “The end to this horrendous crime could now be said to be in sight with greater optimism, more than any other time.” He said Bello Matawalle, the governor, has been working to restore law and order in the state despite the challenges. He added that Matawalle had briefed President Muhammadu Buhari on measures being taken by the state to address the security challenges, including the meetings he held in Niamey with Mohamed Bazoum, President of the Republic of Niger. “The president was briefed of the last visit to the Niger Republic by Matawalle where the President immediately directed the Governor to return to Niamey, Niger Republic, to conclude the remarkable mission of peace,” Dosara said. “This is a heartwarming development for us in the entire north-western states as it has become the bedrock of neutralising the incessant inflow of dangerous weapons into the hands of bandits across the region.” The commissioner advised residents of the state to eschew rumour-mongering, especially on social media, saying it could worsen the security situation.
