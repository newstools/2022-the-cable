Okezie Ikpeazu, governor of Abia, has lashed out at those asking why it is taking long for his administration to complete the construction of a bridge in the state. The construction of Aba-Osisioma flyover is said to have begun in 2017 — over four years since his administration commenced the project. In a recent interview he granted to a radio station in Abia, Ikpeazu said the people did not ask him to construct the bridge but he embarked on the project because he saw a need to. The governor said those asking about the project do not have cars, adding that people who do not have cars have no business with a flyover. “Are you the one that asked me to build the flyover? I started the flyover on my own because I saw the need for it,” he said after he was asked about the project. “Most of the people demanding updates on the flyover don’t have vehicles, they are moving about with legs. “What business does those walking have with the flyover? They should be happy that we are almost done with the flyover. We are currently working on the stone base of the flyover.”
