President Muhammadu Buhari says the federal government is working to ensure that peace returns to Zamfara “in the shortest possible time”. TheCable had reported that Buhari’s scheduled visit to the state on Thursday was cancelled due to “bad weather”. According to Bello Matawalle, governor of Zamfara, the president said he would reschedule the visit for next week, while a date would be communicated later. Speaking with the people of Zamfara through a television broadcast on Thursday evening, Buhari said he was “pained” about being unable to make it to the state. According to a statement by Femi Adesina, presidential spokesman, the president added that he has directed security agencies to sustain operations against bandits in the state. “It pains me that I can no longer be with you today as I had planned. I had just finished what I came to do in Sokoto at the BUA cement facility and was looking forward to meeting you,” he said. “I have been told that the trip cannot hold anymore because of bad weather which has made it impossible for my helicopter to fly to Gusau from Sokoto. “I understand how you feel about this development but I know that you will agree with me that Allah knows best. I particularly sympathise with your governor, Bello Matawalle, and his cabinet who have put everything in place to make the visit a successful one. “I look forward to a more weather-friendly period when I will visit. I am directing our security agencies to sustain the onslaught against terrorists, restrict cross-boundary infiltration and all unauthorised access to the goldmines in the state. “The Federal Government and the Zamfara State Government are working to ensure that peace returns to all parts of the State in the shortest possible time and we expect all citizens to cooperate with, and support in all ways, the Armed Forces and other security agencies.”
