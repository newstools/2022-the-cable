Sunday Dare, minister of youth and sports development, has hailed the Super Eagles for defeating the Pharaohs of Egypt in their opening game at the ongoing AFCON in Cameroon. A lone goal from Kelechi Iheanacho handed the Eagles a victory against the seven-time African champions on Tuesday night and pushed them to the top of Group D. In a statement, the minister urged the team to maintain the urgency and momentum shown in the game against Egypt throughout their stint in the tournament. Dare also said the team’s display against the Pharaohs demonstrated the tenacity of Nigerians to brace the odds. “I urge you to remain focused and take this tournament one game at a time. There is a new spirit and a new attitude and they showed in your total dominance of proceedings today,” he said. “Now we have to stay focused and take it one game at a time. There are more battles ahead and there must not be complacency, just as we must face our next game with the same zeal and determination.” Nigeria’s next game will be Sudan on January 15 in Garoua before meeting Guinea Bissau on January 18.
