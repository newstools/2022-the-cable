Chelsea returned to winning ways in the English Premier League (EPL) following a 2-0 win over Tottenham Hotspurs at the Stamford Bridge on Sunday. Hakim Ziyech and Thiago Silva scored in the second half as Chelsea returned to winning ways, their first in four EPL matches. The game also saw Antonio Conte, former Chelsea manager, return to the Bridge but he left empty-handed as the Blues made it four wins in as many matches against Tottenham this season. Hakim Ziyech curled the ball into the left corner on 47 minutes before Thiago Silva headed in Mason Mount’s free-kick eight minutes later. The defeat is Tottenham’s first league loss since Antonio Conte took over at the London-based club, denting their top-four hopes. Chelsea remain third on the EPL log with 47 points, one behind Liverpool who won 3-1 at Crystal Palace to reduce Manchester City’s lead to nine points. The Reds enjoyed a two-goal halftime lead through Virgil van Dijk’s header and Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain’s neat finish. Jurgen Klopp’s side secured the win through a controversial 89th minute penalty after Palace had outplayed them for a long stretch in the second half and reduced the deficit through Odsonne Edouard in the 55th minute. Meanwhile, Arsenal’s top-four chase was dented following a 0-0 draw with relegation-threatened Burnley at the Emirates Stadium in London. The Gunners dominated but could not break down a sturdy Burnley defence, stretching Arsenal’s winless run to five games in all competition, including two EPL matches.
