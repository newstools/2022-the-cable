Omoyele Sowore, Sahara Reporters founder, has alleged that there was an assassination attempt on his life by thugs on Wednesday. According to Sowore, the incident took place when he tried to gain access to the federal high court to attend the trial of Nnamdi Kanu, leader of the Indigenous People of Biafra (IPOB). “Yesterday I attended the court trial of IPOB leader, at the federal high court in Abuja. Upon arrival, we approached the DSS agents officially but illegally occupying the court entrance and had an exchange,” he said. “It didn’t take long before the regime assassins arrived to take my life. The rest is history but it won’t delay their day of judgement.” In a video which he posted on social media, the activist said: “This is the third time that I’ll attend Kanu’s trial and the regime will send armed thugs to try and harm us. The last time I was there, they broke my car.” <span data-mce-type="bookmark" style="display: inline-block; width: 0px; overflow: hidden; line-height: 0;" class="mce_SELRES_start">﻿</span> Kanu was re-arraigned before Binta Nyako, a federal high court judge, on Wednesday. The IPOB leader pleaded not guilty to the 15-count charge bordering on treasonable felony. Sowore is also answering to criminal charges preferred against him at the federal high court by the federal government.
