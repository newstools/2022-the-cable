Novak Djokovic, Serbian tennis player, has been denied entry into Australia to participate in the upcoming Australian Open grand slam tournament. The world number one tennis player had his visa cancelled by the Australia Border Force (ABF), the country’s border patrol agency, on arrival in the country on Wednesday. Djokovic, who has not been vaccinated against COVID-19, travelled to Australia after disclosing that he received a vaccination exemption. In a statement issued on Wednesday evening, the ABF revealed why it is denying Djokovic entry into Australia. In the statement, it said the 20-time Grand Slam winner’s visa was cancelled because the 34-year-old did not comply with laws and entry requirements of Australia. “The ABF can confirm that Mr Djokovic failed to provide appropriate evidence to meet the entry requirements to Australia, and his visa has been subsequently cancelled,” the statement read. “Non-citizens who do not hold a valid visa on entry or who have had their visa cancelled will be detained and removed from Australia.” It is, however, reported that Djokovic’s lawyers would challenge his deportation as the tennis star seeks to defend his Australia Open title. Djokovic is the defending champion and has won a record nine Australian Open titles. Another title in Australia would see him surpass Rodger Federer and Rafael Nadal to become the all-time record Grand Slam holder with 21 titles.
