The Economic and Financial Crimes Commission(EFCC) has re-arraigned Femi Fani-Kayode, former minister of aviation, on a 17-count charge of fraud. The former minister was re-arraigned on Monday alongside Nenadi Usman, former minister of state for finance; Danjuma Yusuf, a former national chairman of the Association of Local Government of Nigeria (ALGON) and a company, Joint-Trust Dimensions Nigeria Limited, on charges bordering on conspiracy and unlawful retention of funds. The defendants pleaded not guilty. In view of their pleas, the prosecution counsel, Rotimi Oyedepo, asked the court for a trial date. Upon their plea, Ferdinand Orbih, counsel to the first defendant (Usman), prayed the court to allow the defendants continue on the bail terms previously granted them by the court. Although Oyedepo, EFCC counsel, did not oppose the applications of the first and third defendants on the grounds that they have never breached their previous bail conditions, however, opposed Fani-Kayode’s bail application. He drew the court’s attention to allegations that the former minister had forged medical records to delay the trial. Norrison Quakers, Fani-Kayode’s counsel, however, argued that his client “is not a flight risk and has not breached the terms of his bail condition”. In his ruling, Daniel Osiagor, the judge, granted the prayers of the defence and held that the defendants should enjoy the existing bail. The matter was adjourned till March 17 for trial.
