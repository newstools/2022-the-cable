The national working committee (NWC) of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) has named a nine-member post-primary reconciliation committee for Ekiti state. David Mark, former senate president, is the chairman of the committee, while Seyi Makinde, governor of Oyo state, will serve as the co-chairman. Sanusi Daggash, a former minister of national planning, is the secretary of the committee, while Adolphus Wabara, former senate president, is a member. Other members are Zainab Kure, Charles Akitoye, Sergeant Awuse, Bala Mande and Shuaibu Oyedokun. In a statement issued on Monday, Debo Ologunagba, PDP spokesperson, said the committee is to reconcile all aggrieved members in the state, including the aspirants in the recently concluded governorship primary election. “The committee is charged with the sole mandate of reconciling all our stakeholders in Ekiti State including all aspirants in the just concluded Governorship Primary Election in the State,” the statement reads. “This is in line with the commitment of the NWC to ensure an amicable resolution of all issues as our Party sets for a victorious governorship election in Ekiti State.” The opposition party asked its members in Ekiti to “remain focused on the success of the PDP in the forthcoming governorship election in the state”. Controversy and allegations of disenfranchisement had marred the PDP governorship primary election held last Wednesday in the state. Before the poll began, Biodun Olujimi, senator representing Ekiti south who was a top contender in the race, pulled out citing disenfranchisement by the party.
