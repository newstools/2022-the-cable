Novak Djokovic, men’s world number one tennis star, on Sunday, lost the second visa cancellation appeal case against the Australian government. The decision means Djokovic will not participate in this year’s Australian Open grand slam tournament set to begin on Monday in Melbourne. The 34-year-old had on January 5, entered Australia with a visa that included a health exemption certificate but was cancelled by the Australia border force. While the world number one tennis player won the first appeal against the government, the 20-time grand slam winner suffered a second visa cancellation sanction by the government “on health and good order grounds.” Unlike the outcome of the first appeal, Djokovic’s defence could not sway the three-judge panel of the federal court who upheld the government’s re-cancellation decision on “public health grounds”. According to Skysports, the Serbian is now facing a potential three-year ban from travelling to Australia and will be permitted to return only in “compelling circumstances that affect the national interest”. In his reaction, Djokovic, in a statement, said he was extremely disappointed with the ruling — which meant he could not take part in the Australian Open. The tennis superstar, who is aiming for a record 21st major title, added: “I respect the court’s ruling and I will cooperate with the relevant authorities in relation to my departure from the country.” Djokovic has won the Australian Open a record nine times and has been the defending champion since 2019.
