iStrategic Transparent Solutions, a Nigerian firm, is partnering the Russian Software Trade House (RSTH) in the development of a software that will be used to tackle insecurity. The agreement of the partnership is contained in a memorandum of understanding (MoU) signed by both companies. The organisations are working on the software that will be applied in the areas of safety, security and cybercrime — and can be used by both private and public institutions in Nigeria and the West African region. The MoU said the partnership is for the “sole purpose of protecting, preventing and deterring the activities of criminals, insurgents and bandits”. “The provision of a platform for ease of governance and delivery of government services to the people of Nigeria, the West Africa region and beyond,” it read. Detection of corruption, financial crime, money laundering, fraud, illicit financial flows and other financial crimes and digitization of government services are among the priorities the partnership is seeking to address. Speaking at the signing ceremony of the MoU, Habibu Adamu Aliyu, chief executive officer (CEO) of iStrategic, said the firm was founded by some experienced former law enforcement operatives. “Our experts are Seasoned Investigators, Intelligence Analysts, Certified Fraud Examiners, Certified Anti-money Laundering Specialists, Accredited Counter Fraud & Counter Corruption Specialists, Counter Terrorist Financing Specialists, ICT Specialists, Seasoned Prosecutors and Arbitrators with decades of experience in security software solutions, financial crimes investigation, analysis, prosecution, assets tracing and recovery etc,” Aliyu said. The CEO thanked the Nigerian embassy in Russia on the role it played in bringing the partnership to fruition.
