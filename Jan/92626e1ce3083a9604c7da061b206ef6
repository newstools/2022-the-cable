Orji Uzor Kalu, chief whip of the senate, has asked the All Progressives Congress (APC) to postpone its convention planned for February 2022. Speaking with NAN in Abuja on Tuesday, Kalu said the party needs a good atmosphere to conduct the exercise. The former Abia governor said postponing the convention would protect “democracy” in APC. “I still stand by my words that the APC convention should be postponed. I have a lot of respect for our people and they have to give me an alternative view to have a change of mind that what they are saying is real,” he said. “What I am saying is a better atmosphere than what they are saying: I know what I am saying, they might not be seeing what I am seeing. “As a party, we should not cause trouble for ourselves. I believe that the best thing to do is to protect democracy and our party, the APC. “I also call on the national executive committee of the party to reaffirm our constitution to put a President of the Republic and president of the party. “I want us to adopt the ANC method, where you might be president of Nigeria and not president of the party. “So, I want us to test run it when President Muhammadu Buhari leaves in 2023, for Buhari to become president of the party and there will be president of the republic.”
