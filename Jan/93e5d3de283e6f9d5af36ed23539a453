Raymond Dokpesi, former chairman of Daar Communications, says Nigeria’s next president should be someone that will unify the country. The Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) chieftain spoke at the party stakeholders’ meeting in Adamawa. Dokpesi said Nigeria “has never been this disunited”, adding that the country needs someone like Atiku Abubakar, former vice president, to lead the nation out of “its present quagmire”. “Now that 2023 is approaching again. Now that the economy of the country has totally collapsed, and our children cannot find employment,” he said. “It is very glaring that we need somebody who is a unifier, who is very sound, who has business acumen, who himself has investment and wealth of experience and wherewithal to be able to properly lead the country out of its present quagmire like Atiku.” “The country has never been disunited as we have it today, both on religious and ethnic lines. Our economy is in shambles. We have not borrowed as much money externally and locally as we have experienced in the last six or seven years of the APC-led federal government. “What we have under the Buhari administration is a Nigeria that is flowing with the blood of our children. The banditry and insecurity that is available is one which is unprecedented.” In October, Dokpesi had said no candidate from the south will be able to win the 2023 presidential election. This is despite the call by southern governors that all political parties zone their presidential ticket to the south.
