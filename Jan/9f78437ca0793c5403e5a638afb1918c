Abubakar Bello, governor of Niger, says it is time for a “full-fledged war” to be declared against bandits since they have been proscribed as terrorists. Bello said this on Friday, according to a statement by Mary Noel-Berje, chief press secretary to the governor. The governor was reacting to the recent attack on Nakudna and Wurukuci communities in Shiroro LGA of Niger state, which reportedly led to the killing of over 30 residents. The residents were said to have been attacked while harvesting crops on their farmlands, while many houses and food stores were also destroyed during the invasion. While condemning the attacks, Bello expressed concern over the inability of farmers to harvest their crops, adding that the situation could cause food scarcity in the state. He promised to adopt more measures to ensure the protection of residents in the area. According to him, the government and security agencies will intensify efforts to ensure the perpetrators are apprehended. “We are worried by the nefarious activities of these terrorists. Desperation has been noticed amongst them as a result of the onslaught of security agents which has made them target unsuspecting rural inhabitants,” he said. “It is now time that full-fledged war should be declared on these unscrupulous elements since they have been proscribed as terrorists. “We cannot just allow these people to continue with this massacre.” He commiserated with the families of the deceased and wished those who sustained injuries quick recovery.
