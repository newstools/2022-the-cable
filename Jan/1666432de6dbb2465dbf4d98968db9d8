Quadri Aruna has moved three spots up from 14 to 11 in the latest International Table Tennis Federation (ITTF) ranking. Aruna’s new position was announced by the federation on Sunday. With the feat, Aruna has broken the record he set in November when he climbed four spots up from seventeen to thirteen in that month’s ITTF ranking. The table tennis star has also become the first-ever player from the continent to have achieved the latest spot in the world. Aruna’s achievement was made possible following his exploits in 2021. Speaking of the development, the Nigerian said the feat means more hard work for him to get higher on the table. “This is indeed a big challenge for me, and I hope this new year will bring good tidings as I will have to redouble my efforts to remain on top in the ranking and hopefully make it to the top 10,” Aruba said. “I also hope this will motivate more Africans to aim high as nothing is impossible in the sport.”
