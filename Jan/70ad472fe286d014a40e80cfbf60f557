President Muhammadu Buhari has expressed sadness over the recent killing of residents during an attack on Ancha community in Bassa LGA of Plateau state. Garba Shehu, presidential spokesman, in a statement on Thursday, said Buhari also asked stakeholders in the state to ensure that the peace deal involving residents in the LGA does not “collapse”. The community was attacked on Tuesday night with several residents killed and houses set on fire. Danjuma Auta, national secretary of the Irigwe Development Association (IDA), had said 18 residents were killed. Although circumstances that led to the attack are still unclear, the incident occurred months after the Irigwe and Fulani communities in Plateau held a reconciliation meeting. The meeting took place in October 2021. Speaking on the Tuesday incident, Buhari said the recent attack goes against the peace agreement reached between the Irigwe and the Fulani in the area. “My thoughts are with the families of the victims in this time of grief. May their souls rest in peace,” the president was quoted as saying. Buhari also urged communities in the area and the Plateau inter-religious council to “do everything possible to commit to the peace agreement and prevent it from falling apart”. “Every group taking the law into their hands claims to be retaliating. As a society, there is no place for this sort of violence. This is unacceptable,” he added. The president, however, commended Simon Lalong, governor of Plateau, for his efforts in tackling the situation.
