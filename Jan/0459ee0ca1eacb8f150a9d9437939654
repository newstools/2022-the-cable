The Redeemed Christian Church of God (RCCG) says it will offer free surgery for cleft lip and palate patients from across the country. The surgery, organised in partnership with Good Smile Africa Initiative and Smile Train, is designed to be part of the 80th birthday celebration of Enoch Adeboye, general overseer of RCCG. It is also to celebrate his 40 years in the position of general overseer, during which the church has spread to over 195 countries, from an initial 40 parishes. Leke Adeboye, a pastor at the church, said the intervention is one of the initiatives of the church to put smiles on the faces of people from all parts of the country. “A cleft lip/palate is not a curse or evil spirit. Anybody with a cleft lip/palate can be helped,” he said. The surgery will be performed at the Redeemers Health Centre in Redemption Camp, Lagos-Ibadan Expressway. The sessions are to hold from 8am each day between March 22 and 26, 2022, with the opportunity for follow-up visits from May 20 to 22, 2022.
