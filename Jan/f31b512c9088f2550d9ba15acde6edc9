Femi Gbajabiamila, speaker of the house of representatives, says the electoral act amendment bill will be reintroduced in the house on Wednesday. Gbajabiamila said this on the floor of the green chamber on Tuesday while addressing his colleagues who resumed sitting for the year. TheCable had reported how the president declined assent to the bill, citing concerns over the recommendation of direct primaries for political parties. The president had said compulsory direct primary polls for political parties “violates the spirit of democracy”. “The house will reintroduce the amendment tomorrow and we will work quickly to address the mitigating concern, pass the bill and send it to President Muhammadu Buhari for assent,” the speaker said. Speaking on the concerns raised over errors in the bill, Gbajabiamila said he had set up a technical committee to look into the matter, adding that the report would be made available to the house in a few days. He said the “drafting and other technical errors in the bill, is a matter of concern as it appears the version sent to the president differs from what is circulating in the public domain”. “However, in December of last year, I appointed a technical team to look into the issue. I expect to have their report within the next day or two so that we can proceed to the next stage,” the speaker said.
