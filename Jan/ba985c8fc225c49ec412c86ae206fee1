Gernot Rohr, former Super Eagles head coach, is in talks with the Ghana Football Association (GFA) to become Black Stars manager, TheCable understands. Rohr was dismissed by the Nigeria Football Federation (NFF) last December after a series of unsatisfactory performances in the Qatar 2022 World Cup qualifiers. The Franco-German has been without a job ever since last month while the Black Stars of Ghana are also without a manager following the dismissal of Milovan Rajevac after the team’s premature exit from the group stage of the ongoing Africa Cup of Nations (AFCON). On Friday, a source close to Rohr confirmed to TheCable that the 68-year-old has open negotiation with GFA to become the Stars’ new head coach. It is also understood that nothing has been confirmed yet between both parties. If it goes through, Rohr will be coaching Ghana against the Eagles at the upcoming World Cup qualification play-off billed for March 2022. The winner of the fixture will earn one of five tickets to represent Africa at the World Cup later this year in Qatar.
