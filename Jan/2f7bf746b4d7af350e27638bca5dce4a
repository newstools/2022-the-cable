The Federal Airports Authority of Nigeria (FAAN) has unveiled its plan to expand the General Aviation Terminal (GAT) of the Lagos airport. The agency said it would expand the Zulu wing of the terminal as part of efforts to improve infrastructure and service delivery. In a statement on Friday, Henrietta Yakubu, FAAN general manager of corporate affairs, said the expansion project “will commence any moment from now”. Yakubu said the project would only hamper passenger facilitation “minimally” at the terminal as normal passenger check-in would not be affected in any way. “However, the Protocol and VIP lounge at the terminal will be affected, as the facilities will be relocated temporarily till the end of the project, since major construction works will be carried out in that axis of the terminal,” the statement reads. “Meanwhile, the Authority is already making arrangements for temporary spaces to be used as Protocol and VIP lounges, while the project is being executed. “When the expansion project is completed, the terminal would have been enhanced in terms of capacity, aesthetics and passenger comfort, as the expected and expanded new lounges will be twice what is presently on ground.” Yakubu said the authority would like to appeal to passengers and other airport users to be patient and bear with any inconvenience during the duration of the project. She said FAAN would continue to give more updates on the project as the need arises.
