Bola Tinubu, a former governor of Lagos state, says there is no rule preventing a kingmaker from becoming king. Tinubu played a role in the merger of different parties to form the All Progressives Congress (APC), and the subsequent emergence of President Muhammadu Buhari as the party’s candidate in 2015, thus earning him the moniker. The APC chieftain on Monday said he had informed Buhari about his intention to run for the presidency in 2023. Fielding questions from reporters after meeting with Buhari at the presidential villa, Tinubu said he would pursue his ambition without the title of “kingmaker”. “About the cap of kingmaker. I have never seen the cap of a kingmaker before,” he said. “That is the truth and I have never seen where it is written in the rule book anywhere in any country that a kingmaker cannot be a king – unless you commit murder. “So, whatever is your attribute [of me] is your own opinion. Me, I want to pursue my ambition without the title of a kingmaker. You can write your literature and story based on your own perception.” The former governor said Buhari is not stopping him from pursuing his lifelong ambition to be Nigeria’s president. “He (Buhari) is a democrat. He didn’t ask me to stop. He didn’t ask me not to attempt and pursue my lifelong ambition,” he said. “So, why do I expect him to say more than that? You are running a democratic dispensation, and you must adopt the principles and the values and virtues of democracy. That’s it.” The former Lagos governor said he has the capacity to govern Nigeria. “I have the confidence, the vision, the capacity to rule, build on the foundation of Mr. President, and turn Nigeria better,” he said. “In Lagos state, you’ve seen that experience and the capacity to turn things around and that is what we are doing.”
