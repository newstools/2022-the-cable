Hoodlums suspected to be members of the Eastern Security Network (ESN), on Monday, razed a Toyota Sienna vehicle in Ekwulobia, Aguata LGA, Anambra state. The suspects were said to be enforcing the Monday sit-at-home order declared by the Indigenous People of Biafra (IPOB). The development comes despite the announcement by IPOB in November 2021, suspending the sit-at-home directive. It is not yet clear if there were casualties from the attack on Monday. When contacted, Tochukwu Ikenga, Anambra police spokesperson, said although there is no tension in Ekwulobia, “there is a reported case of arson”. “The commissioner of police, CP Echeng, has since ordered reinforcement teams from the command headquarters to intensify patrols around major areas like Onitsha, Nnewi, Ihiala, Aguata, Awka and other environs in the state,” he said. “The reinforcement teams which comprise police mobile operatives, counter terrorist units, special forces and other tactical teams are to address any security concern that may arise and to forestall any breakdown of law and order in the state. “This order is following a reported case of arson around the boundary between Ekwulobia and Okoh at about 7 am today 10/1/22. “Police operatives are currently on ground and normalcy has been restored in the area. The situation is being monitored.”
