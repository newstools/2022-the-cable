The Economic and Financial Crimes Commission (EFCC) has filed criminal charges against Rochas Okorocha, senator representing Imo west. The 17-count charge was filed on Monday before a federal high court in Abuja. According to the commission, the former Imo governor allegedly conspired with others, including a member of the All Progressives Congress (APC) and five companies, to steal N2.9 billion public funds. Aside from Okorocha, other defendants are Anyim Nyerere Chinenye, Naphtali International Limited, Perfect Finish Multi Projects Limited, Consolid Projects Consulting Limited, Pramif International Limited, and Legend World Concepts Limited. In April 2021, the EFCC arrested the former governor and he was grilled for two days over issues bothering on alleged corruption. Okorocha, who governed Imo from 2011 to 2019, had been accused by the state government of various corrupt practices including diversion of public funds — although he has denied any wrongdoing. Documents obtained by TheCable showed how the former governor awarded 12 contracts worth N20 billion in violation of the public procurement act. TheCable had also reported how a government committee uncovered N112.8 billion “dubious debts” which various banks owed the state during Okorocha’s tenure. Meanwhile, the development comes hours after Okorocha formally declared his interest to run for the office of president in 2023.
