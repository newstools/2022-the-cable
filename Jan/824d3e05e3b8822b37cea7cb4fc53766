President Muhammadu Buhari has charged the Super Eagles to aim for gold at the forthcoming 2022 Africa Cup of Nations (AFCON) in Cameroon. Buhari addressed the team in Abuja on Tuesday during a send forth dinner organised for the players and staff ahead of their final departure. The national team is billed to depart the country on Wednesday night ahead of the tournament which kicks off on Sunday. Buhari, who was represented by Sunday Dare, sports minister, said the team possesses the skills and talent to succeed at the tournament. The president assured the team that Nigerians are behind them, adding that they should strive and live up to expectations. “We have been champions three times and at other times we have won silver and bronze medals. But we want to win the gold again this time,” a statement by Clem Agba, minister of state for finance, budget and national planning, read. The president also charged the team not to be discouraged by recent challenges which include COVID-19 and injuries. “We have followed your preparations for this tournament and have seen the challenges that you have faced with the late release from your clubs, the Covid-19 protocols, injuries and other factors,” it added. “We urge you to rather see these obstacles as a stepping stone to your success and glory by demonstrating the Nigerian spirit of determination, focus, resilience, discipline and conquest on and off the pitch.” The Nigerian team, led by Augustine Eguavoen, will begin their campaign at the tournament on January 11 against the Pharaohs of Egypt in Garoua.
