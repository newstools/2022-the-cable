Iyorchia Ayu, national chairman of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP), and other members of the party’s national working committee (NWC) are currently in a closed-door meeting with former President Olusegun Obasanjo. The PDP chieftains, including former governors, arrived at the Abeokuta residence of the former president on Saturday afternoon. Peter Obi, former vice-presidential candidate of the PDP in the 2019 election, and former governors like Sule Lamido (Jigawa), Olusegun Mimiko (Ondo), Liyel Imoke (Cross River) and Donald Duke (Cross River) are present at the meeting. Others include Taofeek Arapaja, the party’s national chairman, south, and other party officials. Although the agenda of the meeting is yet to be ascertained, it may be connected with the 2023 elections. Obasanjo was elected president twice on the platform of the PDP but in 2015, the former president distanced himself from party politics. With about a year to the 2023 elections, politicians and political parties are frantically making moves that will boost their chances at the polls.
