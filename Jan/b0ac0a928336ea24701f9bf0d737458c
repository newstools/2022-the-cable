A worker with INTERSOS, an international humanitarian organisation, has allegedly raped a female internally displaced person (IDP) in Maiduguri, the Borno capital. Over a million people have been displaced by Boko Haram insurgents in the state. Enkas Chau, INTERSOS head of mission Nigeria, in a memo on Wednesday, said the alleged rape was connected to the death of the victim. “We are saddened to inform you that one of our Nigerian staff members is currently held in police custody in Maiduguri. He is accused of having committed rape and other violence connected with the death of a woman, as well as having caused a traffic accident leading to the injury of another person,” the memo reads. “The incident happened in Maiduguri town. Upon learning about this terrible incident, we have immediately suspended the staff, who was off duty and on vacation when the incident happened. As the investigation is ongoing, we will closely monitor the development and take appropriate actions accordingly. “We express our deep sorrow to the families of the victims. At this moment, we are focusing on gathering additional information, and providing the necessary assistance to the authorities. “INTERSOS has a zero-tolerance policy against any form of Sexual and Gender Based Violence (SGBV). Our recruitment process follows strict and detailed guidelines in compliance with the organisation’s ‘Prevention of Sexual Exploitation and Abuse Policy’, and its implementation is constantly followed up by a dedicated unit. We are also part of the Inter-Agency Scheme for the Disclosure of Safeguarding-related Misconduct in the Recruitment Process within the Humanitarian and Development Sector. “As we go through this difficult time, we kindly ask you to share any information you may receive regarding the case with me at nigeria@intersos.org, while we stay at your disposal for any further questions.”
