The Ebonyi government has asked residents in the state to disregard the sit-at-home order of the Indigenous People of Biafra (IPOB). The proscribed separatist organisation had said there will be a sit-at-home protest in the south-east on Tuesday. Emma Powerful, IPOB’s spokesperson, who announced the order on Saturday, had said the sit-at-home order is in solidarity with Nnamdi Kanu, leader of the group, who is scheduled to appear in court on January 18, 19 and 20 for the continuation of his trial. “Following our leader’s upcoming court proceedings on the 18th, 19th and 20th of January 2022 next week, we wish to remind Biafrans that there will be only sit-at-home on 18th of January, and not 19th and 20th of January. In keeping with our avowed solidarity with our Leader, the entire Biafra land will be on lockdown only on January 18 for obvious reasons,” the statement reads. But reacting to the order on Sunday, the Ebonyi government asked all markets and parks in the state to open for business, adding that failure to do so will attract “severe punishment”. “All markets and parks leaderships in Ebonyi are by this announcement directed to ensure that markets are open for businesses on Monday, Tuesday and Wednesday,” Nwachukwu Eze, commissioner for markets and parks, said in a statement. “The state is not in any way part of the sit-at-home order by IPOB. Please note that strict compliance to this directive is very important as failure to do so will attract severe punishment.” The directive asking residents to ignore the sit-at-home order comes days after David Umahi, governor of Ebonyi, said the state “can never” be part of IPOB’s proposed nation of Biafra.
