Novak Djokovic, the world’s number one men’s tennis player, has won his appeal to nullify the cancellation of his visa and grant him exemption status to stay in Australia for the grand slam tournament. Barring any dramatic turn of events, the Serbian is now free to defend his Australian Open title. Djokovic, a nine-time Australian Open winner, has been in isolation detention since his visa was cancelled on arrival in Australia, with the border police citing irregularity with his entry visa’s eligibility for a vaccine exemption certificate. The 34-year-old had appealed the decision and was allowed to stay in a detention hotel awaiting his court case. According to SkySports, the Australian government had argued in court that it gave no assurance on Djokovic’s entry into the country, adding that he had to meet certain criteria. “This is because there is no such thing as an assurance of entry by a non-citizen into Australia. Rather, there are criteria and conditions for entry, and reasons for refusal or cancellation of a visa,” the government filed in court. However, Anthony Kelly of the federal circuit court on Monday morning ruled in favour of Djokovic. The judge quashed the nine-time Australian Open winner’s visa cancellation and ordered Djokovic’s release within half an hour. Kelly also ruled that the Australian government should pay his legal costs. The 2022 Australian Open is set to hold from January 17 to 20 in Melbourne.
