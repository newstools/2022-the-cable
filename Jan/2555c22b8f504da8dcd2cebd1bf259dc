Aminu Tambuwal, governor of Sokoto, says he will commence nationwide consultations to decide whether to contest the presidency in 2023. According to a statement issued by Muhammad Bello, special adviser on media and publicity to the governor, Tambuwal spoke on Monday while responding to calls from the state chapter of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) to run for president. “I have listened to our party leaders, women and youths on the call that I should initiate and begin the process of consultations with a view of running and contesting for the President of Nigeria under the banner of our great party,” the governor was quoted as saying. Tambuwal, who is the chairman of the PDP governors’ forum, said he usually consults stakeholders and receive approval before vying for political office. “The voices of wisdom, conscience and advice from our leaders reflecting, anchoring and leveraging on some part of my (political) history, was accurate,” the governor said. “When members of the house of representatives of the seventh assembly approached with their desire for me to contest for the position of speaker, I gave them certain conditions, one of which was that I have leaders — late President Shehu Shagari, former governor Aliyu Magatakarda Wamakko and two others in Sokoto state. “I told them to go to my state and consult with these leaders. If they bless your initiative, I will accept your proposal and contest for the Speaker. “When they came to Sokoto, President Shehu Shagari of blessed memory admonished them that: ‘if you are putting our son forward as the speaker of the house of representatives, your efforts must not be sectional or religious’.”
