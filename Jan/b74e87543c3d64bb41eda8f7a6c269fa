Manchester City were held to a 1-1 draw by Southampton in their English Premier League (EPL) encounter at St. Mary’s Stadium on Saturday. Kylie Walker-Peters put Southampton in the lead in the first stanza before Aymeric Laporte’s second-half header restored parity for Pep Guardiola’s men. It is the first time in 13 EPL matches that City have failed to win a league match, ending a 12-match winning run. A slow start from the EPL leaders saw Southampton take the lead on seven minutes with Walker-Peters finishing off a move he started. Armando Broja thought he had doubled Southampton’s lead but the video assistant referee ruled out his strike for offside. The champions improved but had to wait until the 65th minute, with Laporte meeting Kevin De Bruyne’s free-kick with a header that sailed into the net. Man City hit the bar but could not find the winning goal as Southampton held on at the end. Guardiola’s side has 57 points from 23 matches. Earlier in the day, Manchester United needed a 93rd-minute winner to overcome West Ham United 1-0 at Old Trafford stadium. Marcus Rashford was on hand to poke into the net from three yards out at the back post following a last-gasp counter-attack.
