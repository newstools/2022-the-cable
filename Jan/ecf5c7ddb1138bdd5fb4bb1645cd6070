At least 29 people were killed in a stampede at a church gathering in Monrovia, Liberia’s capital, on Wednesday night. According to Jalawah Tonpo, the country’s deputy information minister, some other victims of the incident are in critical condition. The incident occurred during an all-night Christian worship event at New Kru Town, a neighbourhood on the outskirts of the capital. The stampede reportedly started after a group of armed men attacked the crowd in an attempt to rob them of their belongings. The attack set off panic among the people which reportedly led to the stampede. “The doctors said 29 persons died and some are on the critical list,” Tonpo said. “This is a sad day for the country.” The police also said it has commenced an investigation into the incident. Liberian President George Weah is expected to visit the site of the incident on Thursday afternoon.
