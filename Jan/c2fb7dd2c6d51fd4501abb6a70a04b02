Ahmed Audi, commandant-general of the Nigeria Security and Civil Defence Corps (NSCDC), has advised youths to focus their energy on activities that will benefit the country. He said this in his new year message released on Sunday. He also urged officers of the corps to redouble their commitment in fighting security threats in the country, adding that “perceived enemies” of the country would face the law. “It would no longer be business as usual as marching orders has been given to all zonal commanders and state commandants to deploy officers massively to every nook and cranny of the nation in a renewed fight against all forms of criminalities such as vandalism of critical assets and infrastructure, oil pipelines and installations, electrical and communication equipment, railway sleepers, attack on farmers and other associated organised crimes,” Audi said. “I implore personnel to take advantage of their closeness to members of the public in gathering credible intelligence that would help tackle the various challenges of insecurity affecting the country. “Training and re-training as well as the welfare of officers and men would be given a pivotal consideration in the new year in order to motivate and enhance their capacity for improved performances. “Discipline starts from training and adequate training improves capacity, therefore, we will not compromise standards in NSCDC. Rather, personnel would be guided by the new Standard Operating Procedure and Code of Ethics to give Nigerians the best of service. “I advise that parents and guardians watch over their children very closely. The youths are also enjoined to participate in positive activities that would better their lives and beneficial to the nation as operatives of the corps have been mandated to swoop on any criminal or perceived enemies of the country and such individuals would be made to face the full wrath of the law.” He added that the agency remains committed to improving security in the country.
