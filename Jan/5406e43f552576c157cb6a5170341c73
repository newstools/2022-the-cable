Samuel Ortom, governor of Benue, has granted amnesty to 50 convicts serving various jail terms. Michael Gusa, commissioner for justice and attorney-general of the state, confirmed the development on Thursday at a media briefing in Makurdi, the Benue capital. The pardon, which is in compliance with section 212 of the Nigerian constitution, follows the recommendations by the state advisory council on prerogative of mercy. He said 34 of the convicts were sentenced to death and awaiting execution in custodial centres in Jos. Gusa said the convicts had appealed their death sentences but failed. The commissioner for justice also said 15 convicts, who had been sentenced to death, also had their sentences converted to life imprisonment, while one inmate had his 21-year jail term reduced to 15 years. According to the Gusa, some of the convicts granted amnesty are indigenes of Benue, while others are indigenes of other states who committed the offences in Benue and were convicted before being moved to the Jos correctional centre to serve their jail terms. He also said the approval followed recommendations by officials at correctional centres in Jos and Sokoto where the convicts served. According to him, the prison officials attested to the good conduct of the inmates.
