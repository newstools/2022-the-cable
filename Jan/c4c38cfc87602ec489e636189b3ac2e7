At least 300 shops were destroyed in a fire outbreak at Nguru market in Yobe state on Saturday. According to Ibrahim Adam, chairman of traders association in the market, the fire incident occurred about 7am. Adam said the fire was triggered by high electric voltage, destroying over 300 shops containing fabrics, used clothes, shoes, provisions, and other items. He called on the state and local governments to assist in rehabilitating the market which he said is critical to commercial activities in the area. Mai Mala Buni, governor of the state, described the incident as “sad and unfortunate”. Buni said the recurrence of fire outbreaks has continued to rob traders of their means of livelihood. “Government will continue to explore means of making life meaningful to the people,” Buni said. “This explains why this administration is committed to building modern markets with fire-proof materials across the state to safeguard our traders and their means of livelihood. “Government will ensure timely completion of the modern markets and allocate them to our traders to improve their means of livelihood.” The governor directed the state emergency management agency (SEMA) to assess the damages and provide the government with the details for necessary action.
