The African Union (AU) has suspended Burkina Faso’s membership following the coup that took place in the country. The AU said the suspension would be effective until constitutional order is restored in the country. “Council decides in line with the relevant AU instruments to suspend the participation of Burkina Faso in all AU activities until the effective restoration of constitutional order in the country,” AU said in a tweet on Monday. Last Friday, the Economic Community of West African States (ECOWAS) suspended Burkina Faso and demanded the immediate release of President Roch Marc Kabore who was ousted and detained by the military junta. An ECOWAS delegation and an envoy of the United Nations (UN) are due to visit the country to meet with the coup leaders before deciding on the way forward. Several countries and international bodies have condemned the coup which they fear could further destabilise a country beset by Islamist violence. Paul-Henri Damiba, leader of the military junta, said the country would return to constitutional order “when the conditions are right”. Mali and Guinea, after military takeovers in 2021, were also suspended by the AU. The coup in Burkina Faso is the fourth in the West African region in 18 months.
