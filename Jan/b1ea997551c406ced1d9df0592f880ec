A bill seeking to compel landlords in the federal capital territory (FCT) to receive rent on a monthly basis has passed first reading at the senate. Smart Adeyemi, senator representing Kogi west, is the sponsor of the legislation entitled ‘Advanced rent (residential apartments, office spaces, etc.) regulation bill 2022.” Speaking with journalists after the bill passed for first reading at the upper legislative chamber, Adeyemi said many residents of Abuja are finding it very difficult to cope with huge rent payments. “Some landlords always insist their tenants pay for one year or two years rent. That is wrong,” he said. “By this bill, Nigerians especially Abuja residents will now pay rent on a monthly basis after the expiration of the initial three months. The law we are proposing stipulates a maximum advance rent payment of three months. “After the expiration of the three months rent, the tenants are expected to pay monthly. There are many tenants whose salaries are competing with their rents because they live in cities like Abuja. “Many landlords did not secure loans to build their houses. They are products of free money they acquire from the system. Yet, they make life difficult for poor Nigerians who do not have such privilege of making ill-gotten money from the system and put up structures. “The buildings are constructed in such a manner that an average Nigerian would not be able to afford it. Many people are indulging in corrupt practices to get their rents paid while the ladies take to prostitution.”
