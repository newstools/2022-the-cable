Governors elected on the platform of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) have scheduled a meeting on Monday to discuss “the state of the nation”. C.I.D. Maduabum, director-general, PDP governors’ forum, disclosed this in a statement issued on Sunday in Abuja. Maduabum said the meeting, which is the first of its kind in 2022, would be held at the Rivers state government house in Port Harcourt, adding that it will be presided over by Aminu Tambuwal, governor of Sokoto, who is also chairman of the forum. Referring to the 2023 general election, Maduabum said the meeting is aimed at developing a credible process and plan for Nigeria’s “rebirth”. He said Iyorchia Ayu, national chairman of the party, “has been invited to attend the Port Harcourt meeting to hold consultations with the Governors on strategies for executing the Rescue and Rebuild Nigeria project”. “The meeting will review the state of the states, the state of the nation and the readiness of the PDP to provide the necessary leadership to rescue and rebuild Nigeria,” the statement reads. “The PDP Governors are working in concert and consultations with other leaders of the party and in particular, the Senator Dr Iyorchia Ayu-led National Executive Committee of PDP to craft a credible process and programme for Nigeria’s positive rebirth.” Maduabum added that Nyesom Wike, governor of Rivers, will host his colleagues to a gala night after the meeting. The development comes amid plans by the Nigeria Governors’ Forum (NGF) to hold a meeting on Wednesday in Abuja to discuss pressing national concerns.
