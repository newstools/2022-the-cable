Mohammed Saidu Etsu, an aspirant for the position of national chairman of the All Progressives Congress (APC), says the country must unite against evil. In a New Year message on Friday, Estu said citizens must make the best out of Nigeria because “we have nowhere else to go”. The 36-year-old aspirant said good Nigerians “trump the evil doers in a million fold”. “It requires no proof to know that good Nigerians trump the evil doers in Million folds, so, if evil thrive, it is only because good people did nothing,” he said. “Beginning 2022, All good Nigerians must unite. We must make a pledge to ourselves and to our country that we have nowhere else to go and so we must make this place our best. “While commending our armed forces for their efforts and patriotism, I call on Nigerians to salute a soldier, support them and pray for them. “I pray that in the year 2022, Nigeria shall witness peace, unity and progress. On our part, we shall ensure that our APC reset agenda shall be our driving force to a successful APC National convention, which we are positive of winning the national chairmanship position. “I call on Nigerians to join me as we move to reset the APC back to its founding vision of a progressive party for the masses.”
