President Muhammadu Buhari has charged the Super Eagles to win the second-round match against Tunisia at the ongoing African Cup of Nations (AFCON). In a statement, Femi Adesina, presidential spokesperson, said Buhari spoke with the team in a video conference on Sunday. Buhari urged the Super Eagles to continue their impressive display at the tournament and make the nation proud. “I’ve agreed to speak with you, our gentlemen, because we have been making Nigeria proud. You’ve been winning. Please keep on winning. Thank you to all the Nigerian coaches and, importantly, you to all the players — Kelechi, Moses, and the rest of you. I very much appreciate your efforts. “The Federal Government is supporting you, and I say thank you to all the technical crew and the players. Please keep doing the country proud.” On his part, Austin Eguavoen, Super Eagles interim coach, described the chat with the president as “a morale booster” to the team and promised that they would emerge triumphant against Tunisia. “We are so excited that His Excellency, President Buhari, has come to speak with us this morning. On behalf of the players and the technical crew, I want to say thank you very much, sir,” he said. “The group stage has passed, and your speaking to us is a morale booster. Thank you for your support, Mr President. We also thank the Hon. Minister, and the NFF President. We are so privileged and want to promise that you should just relax. We’ll come out victorious. We won’t let the nation down.” The Super Eagles are billed to battle Tunisia for a place in the quarter-final of the ongoing AFCON on Sunday evening.
