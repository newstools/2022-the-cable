Sharon Ikeazor, minister of state for environment, says the decision by the Nigeria Liquefied Natural Gas (NLNG) Limited to suspend cooking gas exportation will help restore forests and address climate change. In a statement on Monday by Saghir Mohammed, the ministry’s director of press, Ikeazor commended NLNG’s approval for 100 percent domestic supply of the product. The NLNG had, on January 13, announced that it will supply 100 percent of its liquefied petroleum gas (butane and propane) to the Nigerian market. Speaking on the development, Ikeazor said the initiative by NLNG is a step in the right direction that will not only bring down the price of the commodity, but also help achieve the nationally determined contributions (NDCs). She added that the use of wood and charcoal has been a major cause of deforestation, further contributing to air pollution and other pollutants that produce greenhouse gases. “The NLNG should be commended for its sensitivity and responsiveness to the plight of Nigerians,” she said. “For us in the environment sector, this singular decision will not only help in restoring our forests and in addressing some of our climate challenges, but also facilitate the attainment of our Nationally Determined Contribution (NDC) and other aspects of the Paris Agreement. “We in the environment sector strongly support and believe that by making gas available and affordable, being the cleanest of the fossil fuels, Nigeria is now set towards cutting down on its carbon emissions drastically, thus playing a prominent role during the current energy transition period.”
