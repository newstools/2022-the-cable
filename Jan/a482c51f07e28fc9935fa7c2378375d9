Chukwuemeka Nwajiuba, minister of state for education, says the government will intensify efforts to secure the release of abducted schoolchildren. Nwajiuba spoke on Thursday at an event on the national campaign on out-of-school children in Kebbi state. There have been several attacks on schools across the country within the past year, with hundreds of pupils and students abducted. Among other incidents, TheCable had reported how gunmen abducted several students and teachers of FGC, Birnin Yauri, Kebbi, in June 2021. The students have been freed in batches, with 14 students said to still be in captivity. Speaking at the event, Nwajiuba expressed sadness over the development, and called for the support of relevant stakeholders to secure the release of the remaining FGC Kebbi students, as well as other children. “My heart and soul are with all Nigerian children who are still in captivity. I stand with the parents in the circumstance. Government will continue to do all it can to free our children who are being held for what they know nothing about,” he said. Speaking on the high number of out-of-school children in the country, he said the figure is limiting the growth and development of the nation adding that education is a collective responsibility. He said the ministry is committed to ensuring that all children of school ages are returned to the classroom.
