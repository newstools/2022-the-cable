Adeyeye Ogunwusi, the Ooni of Ife, has reportedly imposed a dusk-to-dawn curfew in Ile Ife, Osun state, due to robbery incidents in the area. The curfew, which is till further notice, is to run from 11pm to 5am daily. According to Punch, Abraham Adekola, Lowa Adimula of Ife, said the Ooni-in-council imposed the order on behalf of the monarch to curb crime in the area. “It is true. Restriction of movement had been imposed in the name of Baba Ooni. He is in Sokoto on an official assignment but after consultation with him, we agreed to impose restrictions from 11pm to 5am daily until the situation improves,” Adekola was quoted as saying. “During the restriction, no night party, vigil or movement. It is just to check criminality in the town. Armed robbers had invaded Ife. They killed and maimed people. We just have to act to arrest the situation and since we imposed restrictions, the situation has improved. “Police, vigilante and even chiefs are not sleeping. We are all involved. No one will be molested but we just want to check movement to stop the sudden rise in the armed robbery cases.” When contacted, Yemi Opalola, police public relations officer in Osun, said the command had yet to confirm the development.
