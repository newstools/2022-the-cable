The Super Eagles held a training session in Cameroon on Saturday ahead of their Africa Cup of Nations (AFCON) opener against Egypt. Augustine Eguavoen put the players through their paces as the team intensified preparations for the encounter on Tuesday. Eguavoen’s wards, who defeated Coton Sports Garoua 2-0 in a friendly on Friday, looked sharp as they trained at the VSTS-Annex of Roumde Adjia Stadium. The 2022 AFCON is set to begin on January 9 and will end on February 6. The Super Eagles are placed in Group D alongside Guinea-Bissau, Sudan and seven-time champions Egypt. Below are photos of the three-time African champions in training. <img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-647702" src="https://f5p3e9e4.stackpathcdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/IMG-20220108-WA0046.jpg" alt="" width="600" height="683" /> <img class="alignnone size-large wp-image-647703" src="https://f5p3e9e4.stackpathcdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/IMG-20220108-WA0045.jpg" alt="" width="600" height="600" /> <img class="alignnone size-large wp-image-647704" src="https://f5p3e9e4.stackpathcdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/IMG-20220108-WA0042.jpg" alt="" width="600" height="600" /> <img class="alignnone size-large wp-image-647705" src="https://f5p3e9e4.stackpathcdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/IMG-20220108-WA0044.jpg" alt="" width="600" height="600" /> <img class="alignnone size-large wp-image-647706" src="https://f5p3e9e4.stackpathcdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/IMG-20220108-WA0043.jpg" alt="" width="600" height="600" /> <img class="alignnone size-large wp-image-647707" src="https://f5p3e9e4.stackpathcdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/IMG-20220108-WA0039.jpg" alt="" width="600" height="600" /> <img class="alignnone size-large wp-image-647708" src="https://f5p3e9e4.stackpathcdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/IMG-20220108-WA0040.jpg" alt="" width="600" height="600" /> <img class="alignnone size-large wp-image-647709" src="https://f5p3e9e4.stackpathcdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/IMG-20220108-WA0041.jpg" alt="" width="600" height="600" /> Photo credit: Pooja media
