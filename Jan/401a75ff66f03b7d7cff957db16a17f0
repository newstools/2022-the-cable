President Muhammadu Buhari will, on Wednesday, depart Abuja for Banjul in Gambia for the inauguration of Adama Barrow as president for a second term. Buhari will be a special guest of honour at the inauguration, which will also be graced by other African leaders and will hold at the Independence stadium, Bakau. Garba Shehu, presidential spokesperson, in a statement on Tuesday, said Buhari will be accompanied by Geoffrey Onyeama, minister of foreign affairs; Babagana Monguno, national security adviser; Ahmed Rufai, director-general, National Intelligence Agency (NIA), and other top government officials. Buhari is expected back in the country at the end of the inauguration. “On the invitation of his host, President Buhari will be special guest of honour at the ceremonies to be attended by other African leaders at the Independence Stadium, Bakau,” the statement reads. “President Buhari, along with other ECOWAS leaders, played a leading role in the restoration of democratic rule in The Gambia in 2017 after the former President, Yahya Jammeh, refused to surrender power after losing the election.” In December 2021, Barrow secured another term in office after winning the country’s presidential poll. According to the results announced by the Independent Election Commission (IEC), Barrow got around 53 percent of the votes, while Ousainou Darboe of the United Democratic Party, his closest rival, polled 28 percent.
