The United States consulate in collaboration with the Inter-Religious Coalition Against Corruption in Nigeria has launched a website for Nigerians to report corruption. The website —reportmagomago.com — was designed to create an avenue for citizen engagement to fight corruption. Speaking during the website’s launch, Claire Pierangelo, the US consul general, said the website will give Nigerians the power to report corruption. Pierangelo encouraged Nigerians to demonstrate their commitment to the fight against corruption by making use of the platform designed to address the daily instances of corruption. The US consul expressed optimism that the initiative will spark citizen engagement in the fight against corruption. She added that the initiative will encourage Nigerians affected by corruption to feel empowered to share their experiences. “Countering corruption is not only a key concern in Nigeria but also a core U.S. national security priority for the Biden Administration,” he said. “Growth and development, consistent with the richness and strength of Nigeria, depend on a new narrative and a culture where corruption has no place.” At the event, participants were guided on how to navigate the new platform. On Tuesday, Nigeria ranked 154 out of 180 countries on the 2021 corruption perception index published by Transparency International (TI) — scoring 24 out of 100 points. It is the worst TI corruption perception index rating obtained in the administration of President Muhammadu Buhari.
