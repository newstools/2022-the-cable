Senegal overcame a stubborn Equatorial Guinea 3-1 in the final quarter-final encounter of the African Cup of Nations (AFCON) at the Ahmadou Ahidjo Stadium, Yaounde on Sunday night. Second-half goals from Cheikhou Kouyate and Ismaila Sarr sealed victory for the Terranga Lions after Equatorial Guinea’s Jannick Buyla had cancelled Famara Diedhiou opener. Sadio Mane supplied two assists as Senegal scored two or more goals in consecutive AFCON games after finishing the group stage with only one goal from the penalty spot. Senegal took the lead on 27 minutes with Diedhiou converting at the goalkeeper’s near post after latching on to Mane’s well-weighted through ball. They, however, conceded their first goal at AFCON twelve minutes after the restart, with Buyla equally latching on to a slide-rule pass before finding the bottom corner. A double substitution from Cisse, the Coach, sparked the team to life with Kouyate capitalising on a defensive mistake to poke in the second goal before Sarr scored after an excellent work from Mane. Senegal will now face Burkina Faso in the semi-final on Wednesday at 8 pm. Earlier in the day, Egypt sent Morocco out of the tournament with a 2-1 win after extra time. Mohamed Salah equalised before assisting Mahmoud Trezeguet’s extra-time winner to cancel Sofiane Boufal’s sixth-minute penalty. The Pharaohs will face Cameroon in the semi-final. RESULTS
