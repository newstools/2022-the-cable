Alex Iwobi, Super Eagles midfielder, has taken to social media to apologise for the “pain and anguish” the team caused Nigerians following their elimination from the ongoing Africa Cup of Nations (AFCON). On Sunday, the Super Eagles crashed out of AFCON after a 1-0 loss to Tunisia in the round of 16. Shortly after the match, some angry Nigerians stormed the social media pages of Iwobi and Maduka Okoye, claiming the exit was the fault of the duo. Iwobi was particularly blamed for getting a red card in the 66th minute after he stomped on Youssef Mskani’s right ankle. His Instagram page was also flooded with disparaging comments which forced the Everton player to disable the comment section of his posts on Monday. But in a tweet on his Twitter page on Tuesday, Iwobi acknowledged that Nigeria fans deserved more. He also promised that the team will be back “to fight for our nation, stronger.” “Moments of joy can quickly turn into pain and anguish. As much as it’s a part of football, we came for more.. our fans who shared these moments with us both in Cameroon and across the world deserved more!” he wrote. “The beauty of the game is that the next moment of jubilation is never too far round the corner. We will be back to fight for our nation, stronger. We owe it to you, and I owe It to myself. Thank you for all the words of support and  encouragement – It doesn’t go unnoticed.” pic.twitter.com/Tvgqz611Q6 — Alexander Iwobi (@alexiwobi) January 25, 2022   After the early exit from AFCON, the Eagles’ attention will now be on the World Cup qualification playoff against Ghana in March this year.
