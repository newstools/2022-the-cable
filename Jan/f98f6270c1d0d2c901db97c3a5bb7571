Nine persons have been killed by bandits following attacks on Igabi and Zaria LGAs of Kaduna state. Samuel Aruwan, the state commissioner for internal security, said the attacks happened on Monday. Aruwan said five other people sustained gunshot injuries. He, however, said two of the bandits were killed by security operatives who also recovered some firearms from the suspects. “Bandits killed seven persons in Kudu da Gari settlement in Sabon Birni, Igabi, while five others were left critically injured in the same area,” Aruwan said. “In another attack at Ruggar Goshe on the outskirts of Kangimin Sarki village, Rigachikun, Igabi, one person was shot dead and they also killed one at Filing Odin Barr, Zaria area.” He said the bandits were retreating to the Malul forest when security operatives intercepted them. The commissioner added that Nasir el-Rufai, the governor, condoled with the families of the deceased and commended the troops for their swift response during the attacks. The government also said adequate security arrangements have been put in place in the affected areas.
