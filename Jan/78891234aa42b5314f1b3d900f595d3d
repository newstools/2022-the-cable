The Indigenous People of Biafra (IPOB) has warned south-east schools against disobeying the order banning the recitation of the Nigerian anthem. In a statement issued on Wednesday, Emma Powerful, IPOB spokesperson, said the ban is necessary if the south-east must achieve its freedom. TheCable had reported how the proscribed separatist group banned the recitation of the national anthem in the south-east and asked school authorities to only teach “the Biafran national anthem”. The group had also created a department christened ‘IPOB education department’ to teach its “history, language, tradition and culture to our children”. “Our achievement in the struggle for Biafra restoration will marvel many traitors because IPOB will soon showcase our achievements so far. We have accomplished so much since this fight for our freedom started, and we give the credit to the Almighty God in heaven who has ordained the restoration of Biafra,” the statement reads. “Again, concerning reading Nigeria national anthem in our schools, we want every school to start reading Biafra national anthem and soon every school is going to receive a copy of Biafra national anthem because Biafra is coming and nothing will stop it and 30th of May every year will be celebrating independence anniversary and nothing will stop that, Biafrans must oblige to this order for our freedom. Any school found wanting or disobeying this order will regret their actions.” “Our leader Mazi Nnamdi Kanu must be released. Nigeria cannot be releasing bandits and terrorists but keep freedom-seekers behind bars perpetually; it’s an error! “We are also warning traitors to stay off our territory because it won’t be easy for them this time because 2022 will be hunt down year for them.”
