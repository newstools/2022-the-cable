Liberian Vice-President Jewel Taylor has commended Yahaya Bello, governor of Kogi, for surpassing 35 percent affirmative action for women in his administration. Nigeria is signatory to the 35 percent affirmative action agreement of 1995, Beijing, China. Apart from appointing a number of female aides, all the LGA deputy chairpersons are women. Speaking at a meeting with female appointees of Bello on Sunday, Taylor said Bello’s style of leadership should be an example for African countries. The vice-president said many politicians often talk about their vision for governance and make several commitments, but never work to realise them. She said Bello has set a remarkable example and is a reference point in defining inclusiveness in governance, adding that “he is doing what women and the young people want”. “I listened to you talk about the inclusion of women, minorities and even opposition and such is a strange phenomenon,” Liberia’s vice-president said. “Most times we get into office and we only think of ourselves and our political party which has always been a recipe for continued chaos and crisis.”
