Saheed Lawal, a point of sales (POS) terminal operator in the Bako area of Ibadan, has been killed by gunmen. Lawal was killed on Friday night shortly after returning home. Bako is a suburb of Ibadan city, located near Omi-Adio along Ibadan–Abeokuta express road. Residents in the area told TheCable that three armed men stormed Lawal’s house around 7.30 pm and shot him in the chest at a close range. A community leader in the area, who preferred anonymity, said the killers came on a motorcycle. He said Lawal was killed after he returned home from a nearby mosque. “The deceased, about 40-year-old, was shot at close range in his house a few minutes after returning home from the mosque,” the community leader told TheCable. “Lawal was a POS operator in the community and financial secretary of the area’s landlord association. The suspected robbers were three in number, they came on a motorcycle. “Two of them positioned themselves close to the deceased residence while one of them knocked at his entrance door. As Lawal was opening the door, the robber opened fire on his chest at a close range.” The source added that the killers also met the victim’s wife, who begged them not to kill his husband. “Unknown to the wife that her husband had been killed, she was begging them not to kill him. They asked for money, and she gave them what she had. It was after the robbers had left that she saw her husband in a pool of his blood,” he added. According to eyewitnesses, two of the killers escaped on the motorcycle that brought them — while the other that was stranded scared residents away with gunshots and escaped through a nearby bush. Residents said the incident was reported at Omi-Adio police station. Adewale Osifeso, the police public relations officer, Oyo state command, did not respond to a call and text message sent to his mobile telephone line.
