The management of the Abuja Electricity Distribution Company (AEDC) says it has paid outstanding salaries, allowances and other entitlements of workers. Abubakar Aliyu, minister of power, announced this in a statement on Monday. Last month, the workers had embarked on an industrial action that led to a shutdown of the company’s power facilities across Abuja, Kogi, Nasarawa and Niger states. This also ushered in a change of the Disco’s management by the shareholders, a move that was approved by the Nigerian Electricity Regulatory Commission (NERC) and the Bureau of Public Enterprises (BPE). Speaking on the development, Aliyu said the ministry’s intervention facilitated the payment of the entitlements as agreed in the memorandum of understanding (MoU) signed by the National Union of Electricity Employees (NUEE) and other stakeholders on December 7, 2021. It was agreed that the federal government would ensure the payment of outstanding entitlements of AEDC staff within 21 days, starting from the date of the signing of the MOU. “The entitlements settled include, unpaid allowances, salaries, union deductions and unremitted 20 months pensions contributions deducted from workers’ salaries,” the statement reads. Aliyu further reaffirmed his commitment to work with all stakeholders to ensure a steady electricity supply and stability in the electricity industry. He added that the federal government will continue to ensure that all the electricity sector players and stakeholders work according to the rules and guidelines.
