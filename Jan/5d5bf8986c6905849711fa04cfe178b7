Greece has donated 907,000 doses of the COVID vaccine to Nigeria. Nikos Dendias, Greece foreign affairs minister, announced the donation on Monday during a visit to government officials in Abuja. Dendias said the donation was support from the Greek government to Nigeria, adding that the COVID pandemic has shown the world that countries need one another. Speaking at a meeting held with Olorunnimbe Mamora, minister of state for health, Dendias said the doses will be received through the COVAX facility. “I am happy that I am symbolically bringing a present with me to the Nigerian people and this is almost a million vaccine doses,” he said. “All the world is suffering from COVID-19, but one huge achievement through this suffering that we clearly understand is that we are one community; that nobody is safe unless everybody is safe. “Health is a global good and all of us are under the moral obligation to be providers of health wherever assistance is needed.” Dendias, who was welcomed to the country by Opunimi Akinkugbe, Nigeria’s ambassador to Greece, also met with Vice-President Yemi Osinbajo, Geoffrey Onyeama, minister of foreign affairs, and other government officials. The meetings with Osinbajo and Onyeama also featured discussions on “strengthening relations with emphasis on investments, trade, tourism, transport, and the security situation in sub-Saharan Africa”.
