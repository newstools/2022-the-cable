Gabon scored a late equalizing goal to hold Ghana to a 1-1 draw in their African Cup of Nations (AFCON) match at the Omnisport Ahmadou Ahidjo Stadium in Yaoundé, Cameroon. Andre Ayew had given Ghana the lead in the 18the minute before Jim Allevinah snatched a point for Gabon to deny the Black Stars their first win of the tournament. In the first face-off between both nations since 2011 and a first ever AFCON meeting, Ghana took the lead when Ayew drilled into the bottom corner after collecting a pass from Thomas Partey. The four-time AFCON winners continued to dominate but were denied by profligacy in the final third. Allevinah, who came on as a substitute, latched on to a pass before drilling into the bottom corner for a surprise leveler and they held on for a precious point. Gabon remain second on four points while Ghana secure their first point in two games. In earlier matches, Morocco defeated Comoros 2-0 to advance into the round of 16, while Senegal and Guinea played out a goalless draw in group B. Both nations would fight for the right to win the group in the final group games. RESULTS
