President Muhammadu Buhari has hailed the Super Eagles for booking a place in the second round of the ongoing African Cup of Nations (AFCON) in Cameroon. Goals from Sadiq Umar and William Troost-Ekong ensured the Eagles won their final group game against Guinea-Bissau on Wednesday. The team finished atop Group D with nine points, having defeated Egypt and Sudan in the previous two games. In a statement by Femi Adesina, presidential spokesman, Buhari also urged the Eagles “to maintain and even surpass the terrific form that made them leaders in the group stage.” He added that Nigerians expect “a total of seven emphatic wins” from the Super Eagles at the African tournament. “President Muhammadu Buhari commends the Super Eagles of Nigeria for keeping hope alive in the ongoing Africa Cup of Nations (AFCON) in Cameroon by winning all their group matches and advancing to the second round of the tournament in grand style,” the statement read. “The President urges the Austin Eguavoen-led team to maintain and even surpass the terrific form that made them leaders in the group stage, as Nigeria hopefully looks forward to a total of seven emphatic wins in this competition. “President Buhari trusts that the positive reputation of good sportsmanship the travelling fans, sportswriters and the football team have demonstrated in Cameroon will continue to enliven the importance of sports, particularly football, as an enabler of development, peace, tolerance, friendship and cooperation. “The President wishes the Super Eagles the very best, pledging that his administration would continue to support the efforts of international, regional and national football organisations to use the sport as a tool to build a better and peaceful world.” The Super Eagles are through to the round of 16 and are billed to face the best third-placed team from either Group E or F on Sunday.
