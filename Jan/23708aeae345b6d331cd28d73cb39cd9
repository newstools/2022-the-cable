The Federal Airports Authority of Nigeria (FAAN) says it has arrested over 90 persons for allegedly carrying out nefarious activities at the international airports in Lagos and Abuja. Henrietta Yakubu, general manager, corporate affairs of FAAN, announced the development in a statement on Monday. She said the arrests were part of efforts to rid the nation’s airports of touting and extortion. According to Yakubu, 59 of the total arrested were handed over to the airport police command in Abuja for prosecution, while 30 others were handed over to the police force in Lagos. Describing the arrested persons as “touts”, the statement added that they were apprehended for various acts of illegalities, including selling fake COVID-19 test results, touting, unauthorised entry, trespass, illegal facilitation, forgery, loitering, theft, public nuisance and arguments, amongst others. Yakubu explained that some of those arrested were staff of Patovilki Nigeria Limited, Lakewood Services, Nigerian Aviation Handling Company (NAHCO) Plc and other airport staff. “FAAN will like to use this opportunity to warn those that do not have any legitimate business at the airports, as well as airport staff carrying out illegal duties to desist from such acts, as the authority will not hesitate to arrest and hand over such individuals for prosecution,” the statement adds.
