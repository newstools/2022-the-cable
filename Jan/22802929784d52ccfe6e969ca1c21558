Burkina Faso overcame Tunisia 1-0 in their African Cup of Nations (AFCON) quarter-final encounter at the Roumde Adjia stadium in Garoua, Cameroon. Dango Ouattara scored the Stallions’ winning goal in first-half added time with a brilliantly crafted effort to cage the Carthage Eagles despite finishing the game with ten men. The 19-year-old Ouattara was shown a straight red card for elbowing his opponent eight minutes from time as Burkina Faso held on to edge the Tunisians in a game they had better chances. The referee initially showed Ouattara a yellow card, but it was upgraded to red after he consulted the replays. Burkina Faso will meet Cameroon, the hosts, in a repeat of the opening game of this year’s tournament. Cameroon eased through by brushing aside Gambia, ending the debutants’ fairytale run with a 2-0 win, courtesy of Karl Toko Ekambi’s brace. RESULTS
