In the attack, Taiwo Awoniyi will lead from the centre with Samuel Chukwueze and Moses Simon to support him from both flanks. Kelechi Iheanacho will be the attacking midfielder while Wilfred Ndidi is accompanied by Scotland-based Joe Aribo, who is making his AFCON debut, in the central midfield. Maduka Okoye is the first choice goalkeeper while Ola Aina and Zaidu Sanusi will take on the right and left-back positions respectively, with William Troost-Ekong and Kenneth Omeruo in the central defense. Nigeria and Egypt are set for a thriller in Garoua, with both countries targeting a result capable of fueling the rest of their adventures at the continental tournament.
