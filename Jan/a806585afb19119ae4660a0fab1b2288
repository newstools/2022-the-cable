Mason Greenwood, English forward, has been suspended by Manchester United amid accusations he attacked and raped Harriet Robson, who happens to be his ex-girlfriend. In a statement on Sunday evening, the Old Trafford club said the 20-year-old forward will not return to training or play matches until further notice. Robson had earlier shared video, pictures and voice notes — which were deleted shortly afterwards — to support her claim of assault by Greenwood. In the audio clip, a man appeared to be threatening to attack her while the images showed her bloodied face and body covered in bruises. “To everyone who wants to know what Mason Greenwood actually does to me,” she captioned the images. The club had put out an initial statement after the allegations emerged, saying: “We are aware of images and allegations circulating on social media. “We will not make any further comment until the facts have been established. Manchester United does not condone violence of any kind.” But in a short statement, Man United said: “Mason Greenwood will not return to training or play matches until further notice.” According to BBC, Greenwood has also been arrested on suspicion of rape and assault. It quoted Greater Manchester Police as saying that it was made aware of “social media images and videos posted by a woman reporting incidents of physical violence”. “We can confirm a man in his 20s has since been arrested on suspicion of rape and assault,” the police added. It is understood that the striker remains in custody for questioning amid ongoing investigation. Greenwood, who is a graduate of Manchester United’s academy, has registered 35 goals in 129 appearances for the Red Devils.
