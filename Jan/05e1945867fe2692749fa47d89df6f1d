Ahmed Musa, Super Eagles captain, has downplayed the threat of Mohammed Salah ahead of Nigeria’s opener against Egypt in the upcoming  2021 African Cup of Nations (AFCON). The 29-year-old also warned that the Super Eagles have players “more dangerous” than the Liverpool winger. Salah, who is the leading goal scorer in the English Premier League (EPL) this season, will be spearheading the attack of the Pharaohs when they face Nigeria in the group D opener billed for January 11. Speaking in a press conference in Abuja on Tuesday, Musa said the Egyptians “only talk about Salah” while Nigeria has several players that “their defenders too will be thinking about us.” “I know everybody will be talking about Salah, but if you look at our own side, we have a lot of players that they will be worried about,” he said. “Definitely, we don’t have to think about Salah. They have to think about our own players. They only talk about Salah, but we have Chukwueze and a lot of players from the wing that are more dangerous, and their defenders too will be thinking about us.” The 33rd AFCON will kick off in Cameroon on January 9 and run till February 5, when a new continent champion will emerge.
