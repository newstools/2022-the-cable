President Muhammadu Buhari says he’s not “expecting any appreciation” from Nigerians after the end of his administration. Buhari spoke in a chat with NTA on Thursday. The president said he has, through the years, been involved in governance in various capacities in the country, and he has given his “best” to Nigeria, adding that “what else can I do for this country?” He then added that he hopes that when his administration ends in 2023, Nigerians will recognise that he has served to the “best” of his abilities. “I’ve been a governor, a minister, and I’m in my second term as president. So, I’ve gone through all the systems, and what else can I do for this country?” Buhari said. “I’ve given my best, and I hope after I leave, Nigerians will reflect. I’m not expecting any appreciation but what I’m expecting is for Nigerians to say this man has done his best. That’s what I’m expecting from Nigerians.”
