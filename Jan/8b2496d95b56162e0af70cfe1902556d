Lionel Messi, Paris Saint-Germain (PSG) and Argentine player, has tested positive for COVID-19. PSG announced Messi’s COVID-19 status in a statement on Sunday. The club also disclosed that three other players and one coaching staff tested positive for the novel coronavirus in the latest round of testing carried out on New Year’s Day. “The 4 [sic] players that tested positive for Covid-19 are Lionel Messi, Juan Bernat, Sergio Rico and Nathan Bitumazala,” the statement read. “They are currently in isolation and are subject to the appropriate health protocol.” The statement also added that injured Neymar will return to the club on January 9 from Brazil where he has been undergoing rehabilitation. “Neymar JR will continue his treatment in Brazil until 9 January with members of the Paris Saint-Germain medical and performance staff. His return to training is still expected to be in about 3 weeks,” the statement added. Messi, who is a seven-time Ballon d’Or winner, joined PSG in the summer on a free transfer after ending his 21-year stay at Barcelona due to a lack of financial strength at the Camp Nou club. The 34-year-old has scored once in eleven French league matches and added five Champions League goals in five appearances for PSG since his arrival at Parc des Princes.
