A  magistrate court in Bauchi has sentenced one Abraham Owen, to non-custodial punishment of sweeping the Abubakar Tafawa Balewa Stadium for three months. Owen, aged 40, was found guilty of misappropriating N145,000 belonging to the Alfijir Wisdom Academy, Bauchi, where he worked as the school headmaster from 2017 to 2019. Fatima Shuaibu, the plaintiff, had filed the suit against Owen on June 2, 2020. He was subsequently arraigned on a three-count charge of cheating, breach of trust and misappropriation. Delivering judgment on Thursday, Sadiya Salihu, the presiding magistrate said after discreet investigations, the accused was found guilty of the offence. She ordered him to pay N130,000 and N20,000 as compensation to the plaintiff. The magistrate said the judgment was based on sections 305 and 78 of the penal code law of Bauchi state. The non-custodial sentence, according to the court, was imposed to allow the defendant to raise the money because he had been fired from his job at the school and had lost his source of income. The court ordered that the daily labour be carried out under the supervision of a non-custodial officer, who should report back to the court on March 22, 2022.
