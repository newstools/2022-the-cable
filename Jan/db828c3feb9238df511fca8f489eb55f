The first twelve matches of the ongoing African Cup of Nations (AFCON) in Cameroon have seen 12 goals, including four penalties. Despite the drought in front of goal, some strikes are deserving of the excellence behind the execution, and TheCable Sports reviews three of such goals that have entertained the spectators. Ablie Jallow fires Gambia to historic victory on AFCON debut #AFCONGoals credit: @CAF_Online pic.twitter.com/FFUdoITrwc — Remi Sulola (@kisusulola1) January 13, 2022  While the Gambia was playing their first-ever AFCON match, Ablie Jallow scored a well-struck goal — their first-ever – for a historic win. The Belgium-based winger expertly controlled the ball before delicately volleying it into the far corner from 25 yards. A worthy winner!

The execution from ‘Senioman Kelz’ under pressure was spectacular. Aaron Boupendza blast shot past surprised Comoros goalkeeper from acute angle for Gabon's win #AFCONGoals credit: @CAF_Online pic.twitter.com/p9NEqDc6YZ — Remi Sulola (@kisusulola1) January 13, 2022  Aaron Boupendza stepped up for Gabon in the absence of Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang. The striker ran onto a through ball, steadied himself before blasting his shot into the roof of the net at the near post from an acute angle. The goalkeeper looked surprised but Gabon celebrated. Aubameyang wouldn’t have done any better.
