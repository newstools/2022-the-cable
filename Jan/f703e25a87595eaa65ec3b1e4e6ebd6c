Nwaduche Ekeneotutu, a 49-year-old native doctor, has been arrested for allegedly raping and impregnating a 15-year-old girl in Enugu-Ukwu, Njikoka LGA of Anambra. Rachel Yohanna, executive director of Davina Care Foundation, told NAN on Saturday, that the case was brought to the foundation by the vigilante group in the area. The native doctor who is a friend of the girl’s mother was said to have been giving the girl treatment to cure her of an ogbanje spirit. Yohanna said the crime was reported at Nimo police station on December 21,  and the perpetrator was arrested. She said the girl was also taken to Ntasi Centre for sexual assault cases at Enugu-Ukwu General Hospital, where it was confirmed that she was three months pregnant. “The Enugu-Ukwu vigilante group said they noticed the girl was roaming the area aimlessly. They called her and she narrated that she was sent away by her mother because she was pregnant,” Yohanna said. “The girl told us the native doctor sleeps with her every night and abuses her. “During interrogation, the mother of the victim told us she sent the girl back to the man who impregnated her. “The native doctor, from Nawfia, told us he started sleeping with the girl when her mother asked him to marry the girl in place of her treatment bills which they could not afford.” Yohanna said the case had been transferred to the state criminal investigation and intelligence department for further investigation. According to her, the foundation will mobilise support and follow up the case until justice is done.
