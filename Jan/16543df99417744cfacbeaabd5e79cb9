Seven Comorian players are out of their Africa Cup of Nations (AFCON) round of 16 clash against Cameroon. Amir Abdou, the team’s head coach, also tested positive for the virus alongside three other officials. Comoros, AFCON debutants, are billed to play the hosts on Monday without a professional goalkeeper. Moyadh Ousseini and Ali Ahamada, the two remaining fit keepers in the squad, are among those who have tested positive for coronavirus. With first-choice Salim Ben Boina out through injury, the Coelacanths are battling a goalkeeping crisis ahead of the biggest match in the country’s history. El Hadad Himidi, the team’s general manager, acknowledged that the team’s “situation is really complicated” but added that they “will do everything in our power to find a solution”. The development comes just a few hours after 12 Tunisian players and Mondher Kebaier, the head coach, tested positive for COVID-19, ahead of their AFCON game against Nigeria on Sunday. The affected Tunisian players are Wahbi Khazri, Aissa Laidouni, Dylan Bronn, Ghaylène Chaalali, Ellyes Skhiri, Anis Ben Slimane, Mohamed Romdhane, Ali Maâloul, Ben Hmida, Aymen Dahmen  Yoann Touzgha and Issam Jebali. The round of 16 matches at the ongoing AFCON are scheduled to hold between January 22 and 26.
