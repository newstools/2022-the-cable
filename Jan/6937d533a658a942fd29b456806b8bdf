The police command in Anambra says its operatives have arrested a commander of the Anambra Vigilance Group (AVG) for allegedly torturing a female police officer. Tochukwu Ikenga, the state police spokesperson, confirmed the arrest in a statement on Saturday. The commander, whose name was not disclosed, was said to have detained and tortured the officer at the AVG office in Awuda Nnobi in Idemili south LGA of the state on January 12. Ikenga said the arrest was made following a trending video on social media in which some members of AVG were seen harassing and torturing a female police officer in their office. According to the spokesman, Echeng Echeng, Anambra commissioner of police, had ordered the immediate arrest of the commander and investigation of the incident. He said the vigilance group commander is now in police custody. “The police described the act as cowardly and said that the command is always ready to protect women against violence even if the person is not part of the security community,” the statement reads. Ikenga said the police commissioner also thanked members of the public, especially residents of the state, for condemning the act. He assured residents that the command would not tolerate human rights abuse of any kind.
