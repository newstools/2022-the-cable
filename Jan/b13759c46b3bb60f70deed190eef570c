It added that passengers arriving from these three countries to the UAE must have a negative COVID-19 test obtained within 48 hours of departure from the approved labs in their respective countries. The UAE authority said passengers must undergo a Rapid PCR test at the airports of departure. On arrival in the UAE, they will be subjected to another PCR test. The Arab nation asked residents of African countries to refrain from travelling to the country if they have COVID-19 symptoms. Travel restrictions were put in place in December by the Arab country over the emergence of the Omicron variant of COVID-19. Emirates Airline, the flag carrier of the UAE, had also suspended flights to several African nations as a result of the directive. Last two weeks, the airline resumed flights from five African countries — excluding Nigeria.
