The Super Eagles held a training session in Cameroon ahead of their Saturday’s Group D Africa Cup of Nations (AFCON)  game with Sudan. Nigeria got its AFCON campaign off to a winning start with a win against Egypt, the seven-time champions, with Kelechi Iheanacho’s superbly-taken goal being the difference between the teams. Nigeria and Sudan last met in a 2018 African Nations Championship (CHAN) semifinal in Morocco. The Eagles won the game 1-0, thanks to a goal from Gabriel Okechukwu. The two nations will be meeting again on Saturday at the Roumde Adjia Stadium at 5 pm. The other match in Group D will see Guinea-Bissau take on Egypt later on Saturday evening. TheCable was physically present at the Eagles training session on Friday in Garoua.
