President Muhammadu Buhari has ruled out state police as an option to address the country’s security challenges. In recent times, the clamour for state police has heightened in many parts of the country, owing to the rising insecurity. On several occasions, the governors in the southern region of the country have emphasised the need for state police against the current form of policing controlled by the federal government. Speaking in an interview with Channels Television aired on Wednesday, Buhari said Nigerians should question why governors, who are in the forefront of the clamour for state police, have not given powers to local governments. “State police is not an option. Find out the relationship between local governments and the governors. Are the third tier of government getting what they are supposed to get constitutionally?” he asked. “Are they getting it? Let the people in the local governments tell you the truth — the fight between local governments and the governor.” Proffering solutions to country’s insecurity, the president said Nigeria can revert to the traditional rulers for recommendations. “The role of traditional rulers must not be undermined, because in their areas they know who is who, even by families, not to even talk of individuals,” he added. “So, we have to revert to that system for us to have effective security in the localities.”
