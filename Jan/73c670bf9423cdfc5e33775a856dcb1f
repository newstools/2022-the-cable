Cameroon, African Cup of Nations (AFCON) hosts, confirmed their position as Group A winners despite a 1-1 draw against Cape Verde on Monday. Vincent Aboubakar, Cameroon captain, was again on the score sheet as Cameroon were denied a win for the first time at the tournament. The 29-year-old striker latched on to a poor clearance to drive a shot into the net on 39 minutes. The goal is the Saudi Arabia-based player’s fifth of the African championship, extending his lead on the top scorers’ chat. Cape Verde, who were requiring a way for a sure spot in the round of 16, however, equalized through Garry Rodrigues as he finished off a low pull back from the byline into the net for 1-1. Cameroon have seven points and remain top of Group A ahead of Burkina Faso. The Burkinabe, who had defeated Cape Verde in the previous match, also played out a 1-1 draw with Ethiopia but qualified based on the head-to-head rule. The Stallions took the lead on 25 minutes but the Walias equalized, thanks to a 52nd-minute penalty. Cape Verde will however wait to determine if they can qualify as a third-best loser at the end of the final round of group matches. RESULTS
