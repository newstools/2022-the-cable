Mansur Matazu, director-general of the Nigerian Meteorological Agency (NiMet), says traditional beliefs and language barrier are hindering the delivery of weather information to farmers. Matazu spoke at a workshop organised by the Human and Environment Development Agenda (HEDA) with the theme ‘Strengthening Climate Information Service Delivery for a Resilient Food System in Nigeria’. He also identified technical scientific information and poor communication as other factors affecting the delivery of agro-meteorological information to farmers. “The key challenges in the delivery of agro-meteorological information to farmers include traditional beliefs, highly technical scientific information, poor communication, language barriers,” he said. “Hence the essence of collaborative partnerships such as the NiMet-HEDA relationship.” He said NiMet remains open to more partnerships that would improve sustainable food security in Nigeria. He reiterated the position of the federal government in developing the agricultural sector for a sustainable green economy with a focus on a food system development agenda that will lift 100 million Nigerians out of poverty within a decade.
