Zainab Danja, mother of Isiyaku Ali Danja, minority leader of the Kano house of assembly, has been abducted by gunmen. The lawmaker’s mother is said to have been abducted in the early hours of Wednesday. The gunmen numbering about 10 reportedly attacked Gezawa, headquarters of Gezawa LGA, in four vehicles. Confirming the incident, Abdullahi Haruna Kiyawa, spokesman of the police command in Kano, said a rescue operation is underway. “Efforts are being intensified with a view to rescuing the victim and arresting the hoodlums,” he said. Speaking on the abduction, Danja said the kidnappers are yet to contact the family or demand ransom. “The divisional police officer (DPO) called me and told me that he deployed his officers to the scene,” the lawmaker said. “He said they have already launched an investigation into the matter.”
