Shehu Sani, former senator representing Kaduna central, says he will contest the 2023 governorship election in Kaduna state. Speaking in an interview on a radio programme, Sani said he will contest the governorship election on the platform of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP). The senator said when voted into power, he will “clean all the dirt they brought in the state in the name of development”. “We sat with my loyalists and supporters and they wanted me to contest the governor of Kaduna state which I will do to remove APC, God willing,” Sani said. “To remove anointed candidate of the state governor and to enter government house where comrade will be sworn in as the next governor that will bring changes, that will clean all the dirt they brought in the state in the name of development. “I will bring security. This is what my supporters wanted and I trust them. So, I will contest the governorship seat under the PDP. Therefore, I call on the people of Kaduna to support and collaborate with me. “I also solicit for their prayers; I need the prayers of religious leaders, marketers, physically challenged, women and youths. You voted for Mallam as governor what remains now is to have a comrade as a governor so as to see the difference between us. “You must reject the anointed candidate ‎of those who demolished your houses. Support us to see how we form a government that respects the will of the poor in the state.” Sani served as senator from 2015 to 2019. Sani’s declaration of interest to contest the governorship election in Kaduna comes days after Isa Ashiru, the 2019 governorship candidate of the PDP in the state, indicated interest to join the governorship race.
