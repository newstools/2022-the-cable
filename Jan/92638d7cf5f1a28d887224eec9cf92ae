The federal government has released a gazette proscribing bandits as terrorists in Nigeria.

Speaking during a Nigerian Television Authority (NTA) programme on Tuesday, Abubakar Malami, attorney-general of the federation (AGF), had said the government is  trying to ensure that it operates within the confines of international best practices, adding that the gazette would be ready in a few days. On Wednesday, Umar Gwandu, Malami’s spokesperson, announced the release of the gazette. “Notice is hereby given that by the Order of the Federal High Court, Abuja, in suit No. FHC/ABJ/CS/1370/2021 dated 25th November, 2021 as per the schedule to this notice, the activities of Yan Bindiga Group, Yan Ta’adda Group and other similar group in Nigeria are declared to be terrorism and illegal in any part of Nigeria, especially in the North-West and North-Central regions of Nigeria and are proscribed, pursuant to sections I and 2 of the Terrorism (Prevention)Act, 2011,” the gazette reads. “Consequently, the general public is hereby warned that any person or group of persons participating in any manner whatsoever in any form of activities involving or concerning the prosecution of the collective intentions or otherwise of the groups referred to in paragraph 1 of this Notice will be
