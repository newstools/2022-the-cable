The ministry of sports and the Nigeria Football Federation (NFF) will hold a crucial meeting on Thursday over the country’s exit from the ongoing Africa Cup of Nations (AFCON), TheCable can report. Nigeria was sent packing from the tournament in Cameroon on Sunday after a shock 1-0 defeat to the Carthage Eagles of Tunisia. The team has been at the receiving end of intense criticisms, with Nigerians expressing their anger over the loss. According to sources, the meeting, scheduled to hold in Abuja, is at the instance of Sunday Dare, the sports minister. TheCable understands that the meeting would focus on Nigeria’s preparations for the World Cup two-legged play-off against Ghana billed to hold in March. It remains unclear if the matter of the new technical adviser and the retention of interim Eagles’ coach Austin Eguavoen would be on the agenda during the meeting. “Wide-ranging issues would be discussed at the meeting with a view to determining the best preparation for Nigeria as the country looks set to meet eternal rival Ghana in the play-off,” one of the inside sources told TheCable. Dare had earlier assured Nigerians that the Super Eagles would bounce back from their disappointing AFCON exit. “As long as we remain committed to teamwork and a common goal, the Eagles will become more and more formidable,” he had said.
