Rochas Okorocha, senator representing Imo west, has formally declared his bid to run for the office of president — but not without some form of drama. While addressing a press conference in Abuja on Monday, Okorocha likened Nigeria to an aircraft that he would love to pilot. The senator said if elected president, the country would encounter challenges but he’s capable of surmounting them. “Please permit to be your pilot for a new Nigeria, as your pilot there might be small turbulence, no problem, captain Rochas is in command,” the former Imo governor said amid laughter. Okorocha said if elected president, he would hand over power to the youths after the conclusion of his tenure. The former governor said he would use his time as president to prepare the youths for leadership positions. “To the youths, If I become your president, I will handover [power] to the next generation. I’m not not-too-young-to-run and not too old to run, I’m only 57,” he said. “I created 25,000 jobs for the youths. I made 305 millionaires in Imo.” The senator said he detests poverty because of his humble background, adding that his wealth is “clean”. “I will create wealth, I sold oranges – my wealth is clean, go and check CCB [forms],” he said. “Our biggest problem is hunger, I have addressed that in the new Nigeria.”
