The Carthage Eagles went ahead in the early minutes of the second half, and although they fought hard, the Super Eagles could not muster a comeback. Two minutes into the game, Wilfred Ndidi fired an overhead kick into the Tunisian area but it couldn’t trouble Ben Said, the goalkeeper. Nigeria twice went close to drawing the first blood — first through Moses Simon and then Kelechi Iheanacho. In the 16th minute, Samuel Chukwueze crossed with his weaker right foot into the area but Montassar Omar was alert enough to get in the way of Taiwo Awoniyi. Much later, Hamza Rafia made an enterprising run into the Nigerian half but the ball found the hands of Maduka Okoye who looked shaky in making the save. The first half ended goalless as both sides headed to the locker room. Tunisia took the lead shortly after the second half got underway. Youssef Msakni found space and unleashed a screamer beyond Maduka Okoye, who should have done better in making the save. Substitute Alex Iwobi made matters worse for Super Eagles when he was sent off after a dangerous tackle. Following the sending off, the Super Eagles went close through Samuel Chukwueze, Moses Simon and Sadiq Umar — but their efforts failed to pay off.
