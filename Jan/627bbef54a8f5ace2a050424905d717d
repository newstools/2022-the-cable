Cameroon started the Africa Cup of Nations (AFCON) with a 2-1 victory over Burkina Faso on Sunday in their Group A encounter at the Paul Biya Stadium, Olembe, Yaounde. Vincent Aboubakar, the Indomitable Lions’ captain, was on hand to dispatch two penalty kicks to overcome a stubborn Burkina Faso side. The Stallions scored in the 24th minute as Gustavo Sangare slotted into the roof of the net from Bertrand Traore’s cross. Cameroon had not won against the Stallions in their past four meetings but Antonio Conceicao’s team found a way through, no thanks to atrocious tackling from Burkina Faso players. Bertrand conceded the first penalty that was awarded by VAR before Aboubakar coolly converted on 40 minutes. The second arrived deep into added time for an unnecessary tackle in the box and Aboubakar coolly converted again, sending the goalkeeper the wrong way for the match-winning goal and maximum points for Cameroon. They are joined at the top by Cape Verde after a comfortable 1-0 win over ten-man Ethiopia. Julio Tavares’ header was the decider for the Islanders who are featuring in only their third ever AFCON tournament. Cameroon will face Ethiopia while Burkina Faso and Cape Verde will meet on January 13. MATCH DAY ONE RESULTS Cameroon 2-1 Burkina Faso Ethiopia 0-1 Cape Verde
