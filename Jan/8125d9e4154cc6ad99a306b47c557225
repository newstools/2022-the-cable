Publication of sub-committees – February 19. “Screening of all aspirants vying for National Offices – February 20 to 22. Screening appeals to hear and resolve complaints arising from the screening exercise – February 23. “Accreditation of all statutory and elected delegates to the national convention – February 24 and 25.

We are yet to meet on the issue of zoning,” he said. “The news and rumour making the rounds round are fake news. We never discussed the issue during our deliberations. People should disregard the story because it is fake news. It is not true.”
