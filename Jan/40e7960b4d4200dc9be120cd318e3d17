The Fountain University, Osogbo, Osun state, has honoured Toyin Falola, renowned professor of history, with a doctoral degree in public administration. The award was part of programmes to mark the tenth and eleventh convocation ceremonies of the university. In his speech at the award ceremony which took place on Friday, Amidu Sanni, vice-chancellor of the institution, commended Falola for his contributions to the progress of the education sector. In his remarks, Falola thanked the university and congratulated the graduating students. He also encouraged the university administrators to remain committed in their efforts to bring sustainable development to the institution. Speaking on the importance of the award, Falola said it was a first of its kind for him. “In the last 12 months, I have actually rejected four doctorate awards. Why did I accept this one? One, it is my support for a university that is doing well. Second, it is my support for an Islamic faith-based university,” he said. “But they did two unique things, and I was very impressed. I was the only one they gave; that is very impressive. Most times, universities want to crowd the people they give these awards so as to make money from them. I was given that award based on my merit and not because of any promise to do anything. It was the merit of my scholarship. “Another thing which impressed me when I got there was that I was given my first honorary doctorate in public administration. I never knew; I was only told that I would be given an honorary doctorate; I was not told in what area. “Previous ones have been in the humanities and history. Let us say that we are resetting the clock and you should wish me well.”
