Austin Eguavoen, Super Eagles interim head coach, says Gernot Rohr deserves credit for the team’s performance at the ongoing Africa Cup of Nations (AFCON). Rohr was sacked in December 2021 over below-par performances and indiscipline in the squad. Eguavoen was immediately named as the replacement with just a few weeks to AFCON. His appointment was followed by a subdued preparation for the competition due to restrictions imposed by the Omicron variant of coronavirus. However, the Eagles have been brilliant at the continental tourney, advancing from the group stages with nine maximum points — the first time Nigeria would achieve that since AFCON 2006. Speaking with reporters in Garoua, Eguavoen said Rohr’s influence on the team’s performance in Cameroon shouldn’t be overlooked. He added that Franco-German “did a good job assembling these boys” and should be adequately credited for the team’s display. “There’s no way we are not going to give Gernot Rohr credit because he’s the one who put this team together,” the interim head coach said. “We still inherited a team that is 98% Gernot Rohr, so there is no way we are going to leave Gernot Rohr out of this. “He did a good job assembling these boys, but it’s quite unfortunate what has happened. “And if we win the Africa Cup of Nations, it’s for everyone, not just me alone.” The Super Eagles are billed to face the best third-placed team from either Group E or F in the round of 16 on Sunday.
