Sharon Ikeazor, minister of state for environment, says Nigeria will soon sign a pact with Cameroon on ecosystem conservation and sustainable management of forestry and wildlife resources. The minister made this known on Monday at a media briefing held in Abuja. She said the development is part of the steps taken by the ministry to address biodiversity loss, given the alarming rate of overexploitation of natural resources. Ikeazor said Nigeria’s biodiversity plays a vital role in its economy but environmental challenges like pollution, invasive alien species and climate change are threatening it. “Nigeria will soon be signing the cooperation framework agreement on transboundary ecosystem conservation and sustainable management of forestry and wildlife resources with Cameroon,” she said. “Several environmental challenges have led to the loss of biodiversity and threaten our existence. This alarming rate of overexploitation of natural resources calls for urgent, increased and proactive actions to reverse the trends. “The ministry has taken several steps in combating biodiversity loss through domestication of the global biodiversity strategy and action plan; sustainable management of selected critical ecosystems which is ongoing across the country; national forest policy approved by FEC July 2020 is being implemented to address sustainable management of our forests.” The minister added that Nigeria will continue to pursue rangeland restoration, adding that it will collaborate with development partners to accelerate the great green wall initiative in the country.
