Sudan will be looking to get a positive result after playing 0-0 against Guinea-Bissau while Nigeria secured a surprisingly comfortable 1-0 victory over Egypt to kick off their AFCON journey on a winning note. Augustine Eguavoen’s charges claimed all three points courtesy of a first-half strike from Kelechi Iheanacho. As a result, the Super Eagles are top of Group D and can seal their place in the last 16 by securing yet another win in Garoua. Standing in the way of the last 16 qualification is a team that has won just two games in the previous 14 meetings between both sides. The most recent was a 1-0 loss to Nigeria in 2018. Sudan’s draw with Guinea-Bissau keeps their next round qualification hopes alive. Burhan Tia’s men will have to dig deep and perform beyond expectations to defeat the Eagles and remain in the action heading into the final matchday. Team News Nigeria’s possible starting line-up: Maduka Okoye, Ola Aina, Zaidu Sanusi, Semi Ajayi, William Troost-Ekong, Joe Aribo, Wilfred Ndidi, Kelechi Iheanacho, Taiwo Awoniyi, Ahmed Musa, Moses Simon. Sudan’s possible starting line-up: Ali Achrine, Salaheldin Nemer, Mazin Mohamedein, Mustafa Karshoum, Mustafa Elfadni, Mohamed Al Rashed, Abdelrazig Omer, Gumaa Abas Omer, Walieldin Khedr, Mohamed Abdelrahman, Yasin Hamed.
