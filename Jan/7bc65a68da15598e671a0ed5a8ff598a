With the 2021 Africa Cup of Nations (AFCON) set to kick off in Cameroon between January 9 and February 7, TheCable takes a look at eight Super Eagles players who would fly Nigeria’s flag high at the tournament. Odion Ighalo – Al Shabab <img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-362161" src="https://f5p3e9e4.stackpathcdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/Ighalo-AFCON-opener2-e1641197149906.png" alt="" width="600" height="412" /> The 32-year-old represented Nigeria at the 2018 World Cup and was the highest goalscorer in the 2019 AFCON qualification campaign. Ighalo led Nigeria to a third-place finish at the 2019 AFCON, where he made the team of the tournament and was crowned top scorer. The striker currently plays his club football with Saudi Arabian giants Al Shabab and is renowned for his power and direct attacking style. Wilfred Ndidi – Leicester City <img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-197821" src="https://f5p3e9e4.stackpathcdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/Ndidi4.png" alt="" width="562" height="373" srcset="https://f5p3e9e4.stackpathcdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/Ndidi4.png 562w, https://f5p3e9e4.stackpathcdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/Ndidi4-300x199.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 562px) 100vw, 562px" /> A powerful and tireless central midfielder, Ndidi has been a key player for the Nigerian national team and Leicester City for a few years now. The 24-year-old is a box-to-box player who also packs a punch in his long-range shooting ability. Samuel Chukwueze – Villarreal <img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-366897" src="https://f5p3e9e4.stackpathcdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/Chukwueze-e1641197879912.jpeg" alt="" width="600" height="399" /> Blessed with speed, skills and a keen eye for goal, Chukwueze will head to Cameroon as one of Nigeria’s brightest stars. He is equally capable of the killer pass or clean finish in the final third and is very much a fan favourite at Villarreal. Chidozie Awaziem – Alanyaspor <img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-496831" src="https://f5p3e9e4.stackpathcdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Chidozie-Awaziem.jpg" alt="" width="550" height="561" srcset="https://f5p3e9e4.stackpathcdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Chidozie-Awaziem.jpg 550w, https://f5p3e9e4.stackpathcdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Chidozie-Awaziem-294x300.jpg 294w, https://f5p3e9e4.stackpathcdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Chidozie-Awaziem-24x24.jpg 24w, https://f5p3e9e4.stackpathcdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Chidozie-Awaziem-36x36.jpg 36w, https://f5p3e9e4.stackpathcdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Chidozie-Awaziem-48x48.jpg 48w" sizes="(max-width: 550px) 100vw, 550px" /> Awaziem has established himself as one of Turkish Super Lig best defenders in Alanyaspor. The 24-year-old is set to be the player the Nigerian team will build their defence around at the AFCON. Ahmed Musa – Fatih Karagümrük <img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-549081" src="https://f5p3e9e4.stackpathcdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Ahmed-Musa.png" alt="" width="580" height="335" srcset="https://f5p3e9e4.stackpathcdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Ahmed-Musa.png 580w, https://f5p3e9e4.stackpathcdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Ahmed-Musa-300x173.png 300w, https://f5p3e9e4.stackpathcdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Ahmed-Musa-24x14.png 24w, https://f5p3e9e4.stackpathcdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Ahmed-Musa-36x21.png 36w, https://f5p3e9e4.stackpathcdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Ahmed-Musa-48x28.png 48w" sizes="(max-width: 580px) 100vw, 580px" /> The 28-year-old’s experience and ability to transition from defence to attack (and vice versa) makes him the pivot around which the Super Eagles move. Kelechi Iheanacho – Leicester City <img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-544649" src="https://f5p3e9e4.stackpathcdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Iheanacho.jpeg" alt="" width="600" height="400" srcset="https://f5p3e9e4.stackpathcdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Iheanacho.jpeg 600w, https://f5p3e9e4.stackpathcdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Iheanacho-300x200.jpeg 300w, https://f5p3e9e4.stackpathcdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Iheanacho-24x16.jpeg 24w, https://f5p3e9e4.stackpathcdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Iheanacho-36x24.jpeg 36w, https://f5p3e9e4.stackpathcdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Iheanacho-48x32.jpeg 48w" sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" /> A winger or striker, Iheanacho demonstrated his goal-scoring prowess for Nigeria during the 2022 World Cup qualifying campaign. He is set to be the key attacking player for the Super Eagles in Cameroon. Alex Iwobi – Everton <img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-542514" src="https://f5p3e9e4.stackpathcdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Iwobi-1.jpg" alt="" width="680" height="442" srcset="https://f5p3e9e4.stackpathcdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Iwobi-1.jpg 680w, https://f5p3e9e4.stackpathcdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Iwobi-1-300x195.jpg 300w, https://f5p3e9e4.stackpathcdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Iwobi-1-24x16.jpg 24w, https://f5p3e9e4.stackpathcdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Iwobi-1-36x23.jpg 36w, https://f5p3e9e4.stackpathcdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Iwobi-1-48x31.jpg 48w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /> The Arsenal product is expected to be the Super Eagles’ main source of creative inspiration at the African showpiece. William Troost-Ekong – Watford <img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-367193" src="https://f5p3e9e4.stackpathcdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/Troost-Ekong-e1641198952972.jpg" alt="" width="600" height="338" /> The 28-year-old centre-back, who has represented the likes of Udinese, KAA Gent and Bursaspor in his career, will also be one of the Eagles’ key players in Cameroon.
