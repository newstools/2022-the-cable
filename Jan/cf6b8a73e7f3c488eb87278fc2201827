Bisi Fayemi, wife of the Ekiti governor, says she has no link to posters circulating online indicating her interest in contesting for a senatorial seat. On Friday, posters had surfaced online indicating that she was aspiring to represent Ekiti north senatorial district. But in a statement, Bisi Fayemi distanced herself from the posters, saying she has no interest in running for the position. “This morning, I woke up to see posters online for Erelu Bisi Fayemi, Senate, Ekiti North. This information has been circulating for some time now so it is nothing new,” the statement reads. “Today’s poster was however released the morning after Mr Biodun Abayomi Oyebanji emerged as Gubernatorial Candidate for the next Governorship election in Ekiti State. “Those behind this mischief have been floating the narrative that the senatorial seat is going to be my reward for supporting Mr Oyebanji’s aspiration. “My position is as follows: I have no interest whatsoever in contesting for a senatorial seat. I have never discussed this with anyone and how this story keeps circulating is a mystery. Let me repeat, I am not interested. “My sole political agenda in Ekiti State is to support my husband, HE Dr Kayode Fayemi, and to ensure that he finishes well. My husband’s success is the only reward I need. “The Ekiti APC Primaries were held on January 27th, and a winner was declared by the relevant authorities. Many people of all ages spent a lot of time promoting their candidates online, a very important part of the political process. “However, this can be done without resorting to slander, libel, and other untoward acts. While the principals concerned will find ways to resolve their differences, those who bear arms in their name on all sides need to be careful. “I would therefore like to appeal for a cessation of hostilities and for all hands to be on deck.” She further congratulated Oyebanji on his victory at the polls and encouraged the public to “please ignore the fake news”.
