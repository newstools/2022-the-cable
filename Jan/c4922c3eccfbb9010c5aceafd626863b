Babangida Aliyu, former Niger governor, says Vice-President Yemi Osinbajo is the best person the All Progressives Congress (APC) can present as a candidate for the 2023 presidential election. Aliyu said this on Tuesday at the 2022 annual lecture of the Sir Ahmadu Bello Memorial Foundation held in Kano state. According to Punch, the former governor said “riff-raffs or moneybags” will not get to the highest office in the land, even if they offer money in the 2023 election. “Mr vice-president, do you know you are the best candidate in your party?” he asked, describing Osinbajo as the only candidate that knows the country and has wide acceptance, regardless of tribe and religion. On his part, Sidi Bage, Emir of Lafia, also praised the vice-president and promised that Nasarawa state would give him all the necessary support to enable him to become the next president. “Mr vice-president, wherever you go, we will follow,” he added. Although Osinbajo hasn’t expressed interest in running for the office of the president, there have been several calls for the vice-president to contest in the 2023 presidential election. A group known as the National Women’s Coalition for Osinbajo (NWCO), made up of market women, farmers, traders, artisans and professionals, had said Nigeria will have a brighter future under Osinbajo as president, adding that Nigerian women trust him. Also, The New Tribe (TNT), a political group, had asked Osinbajo to contest the presidency, saying he has the best qualities to succeed President Muhammadu Buhari in 2023.
