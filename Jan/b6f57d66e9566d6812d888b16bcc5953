The Miyetti Allah Cattle Breeders Association of Nigeria (MACBAN) says its members who endorsed Bola Tinubu, a chieftain of the All Progressives Congress (APC), for the presidency, spoke for themselves. During a meeting on Sunday, Ya’u Haruna, a former chairman of the Jigawa chapter of MACBAN, had said the welfare of members of the association will improve with Tinubu as president in 2023. Haruna had said Tinubu, when he was governor of Lagos, intervened and resolved an issue that involved the association when it had a crisis in Benue. “Tinubu came all the way, got us on a roundtable and reconciled us. So, someone who could do this at that time, we believe, can do more when he is at the helm of affairs,” he had said. Speaking on the development in a statement issued on Wednesday, Baba Ngelzarma, MACBAN national secretary, said the association has not endorsed any presidential aspirant. According to NAN, Ngelzarma added that the association doesn’t wish to be dragged into such political matters at this time. “The attention of the MACBAN National Headquarters has been drawn to stories in the media claiming that we have endorsed the presidential aspiration of Sen. Ahmed Tinubu,” the statement reads. “We want to make it clear that the association has not endorsed any candidate. “Those who endorsed Tinubu are doing so as individuals, as MACBAN should not in any way be dragged into the politics of endorsement at this stage.” On January 10, Tinubu said he had informed President Muhammadu Buhari of his intention to run for president. Tinubu, who spoke after a closed-door meeting with Buhari, had added that he was still consulting stakeholders on the matter.
