The National Drug Law Enforcement Agency (NDLEA) has arrested Godwin Ilevbare, a suspected fake security agent, for importing drug chocolates and cookies from Canada. In a press briefing in Abuja on Sunday, Femi Babafemi, the agency’s spokesperson, said Ilevbare carried out the illegal activity through a courier company. He said Osagie Robert, a 76-year-old grandfather, was also arrested for importing and marketing drugs. The septuagenarian was said to have been arrested on January 7 in Egor, Oredo area, Edo state. “Soon after the suspect signed for the consignment, undercover operatives embedded in the courier firm arrested him at his apartment in Benin city on January 4,” the statement reads. “The consignment, which emanated from Canada, contains Colorado brand of Cannabis concealed inside chocolates and cookies weighing 6.491 Kilogrammes. “While the drug cookies and chocolates weighed 5.566kg and 0.383kg respectively.” The NDLEA also arrested 48-year-old Iloduba Augustine, a passenger that arrived at Akanu Ibiam International Airport, Enugu, from Sao Paulo, Brazil via Addis Ababa, Ethiopia, on New Year’s eve.
