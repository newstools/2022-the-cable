Danlami Nmodu, publisher of Newsdiaryonline, has launched Modus Operandum, a new platform for reporting issues of public interest in Nigeria. Nmodu, a member of the National Institute for Policy and Strategic Studies (NIPSS), launched the new platform on Wednesday. He is currently the deputy president, Guild of Corporate Online Publishers (GOCOP), a non-governmental organisation comprising owners of online publications who have worked previously as journalists in mainstream media in Nigeria. According to him, the new platform will focus on analysis, reviews, reports on issues of public interest and insightful opinions. He added that the platform is an opportunity to impact the benefits of his training at the Jos National Institute for Policy and Strategic Studies (NIPSS)  to the society. “After reflecting on the investment in me, I believe I needed to float this platform for insightful analysis of national issues. Hopefully Modus Operandum will emerge as a leading platform contributing towards policy reports and the policy briefs that may be relevant to public administration in Nigeria.” “Essentially, Modus Operandum will for now remain accessible to the public. Modus Operandum will not be driven by the daily routine of breaking news, like Newsdiaryonline, which remains active and strong on news and others. However, the new platform will remain relevant and throw penetrating insight into relevant contemporary issues. “Areas of interest include health, public policy, election and democracy issues, anti corruption matters, defence security and diplomatic issues among others. Analysis from Modus Operandum staff and renowned contributors will be served on regular basis.”
