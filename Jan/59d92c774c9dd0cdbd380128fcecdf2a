Datti Baba-Ahmed, chieftain of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP), has expressed interest in running for governor of Kaduna in the 2023 elections. Baba-Ahmed announced his intention for the top job in Kaduna on Sunday when he submitted his letter of interest to the PDP leadership in the state. The former presidential aspirant in the 2019 election described his intention to run for governor of Kaduna as a “call to duty”. He said he decided to run to serve the people and lead the state to prosperity, not because he wanted power or a position. “Our people are in dire need of a good leader that will secure their lives, their property and bring prosperity to the state,” he said. “I am not here to seek for a job or a position, but I am moved by the plight of the people to offer myself to serve and lead Kaduna residents to the glorious Kaduna state we all aspire. “A good leader is the one that solves societal problems, brings prosperity and development. Therefore, we will fail if we do not screen good leaders that will work to improve the standard of living of the people.” He added that a leader’s integrity, honesty, and transparency are crucial attributes to have in order to better the lives of residents.
