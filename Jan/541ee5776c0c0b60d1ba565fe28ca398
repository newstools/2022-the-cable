The Nigerian Football Federation (NFF) has confirmed that Ashleigh Plumptre, former England youth player, has finally gotten approval to switch her allegiance to the Super Falcons. In a chat with BBC Africa, Ademola Olajire, NFF director of communication, said Plumptre has now been cleared by FIFA, the world football’s governing body, to wear the green and green jersey. He also commended the 23-year-old defender for making the switch possible with her “commitment and dedication,” adding that she “personally approached the English FA” to get the needed clearance. “We are happy to receive Ashleigh’s official clearance from Fifa,” he said. “It was only possible because of her commitment and dedication. She made the federation’s work a lot easier by providing all the requirements in quick time.

That big move on her part obviously helped a lot and prevented the long wait for the FA’s response.” Plumptre, who plays for Leicester City in the Women’s Super League (WSL), is eligible to represent Nigeria due to her father’s Nigerian heritage. In July, the English-born defender was named in the Falcon’s 26-woman list for a training camp in Austria. The proceedings of her eventual international switch have been in motion since then. Plumptre might get her debut when the Falcons face Ivory Coast in the 2022 Africa Women’s Cup of Nations play-off in February.
