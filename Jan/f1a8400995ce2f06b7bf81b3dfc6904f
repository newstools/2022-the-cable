Speaking at the first Downing Street COVID press conference of 2022, Johnson said lateral flow tests would be sent directly to workplaces for “critical national services” including food, transport and border staff. All key workers in these industries would be asked to test themselves every work day. The prime minister said measures such as tests for key workers would help the country “find a way to live with this virus”, despite the rapid spread of the Omicron variant.
