Ernest Shonekan, former head of the interim national government, is dead. Shonekan died in Lagos on Tuesday. He was 85. Born on May 9, 1936, Shonekan was a British-trained lawyer and industrialist. In a statement signed by Adeboye Shonekan, his family said: “To the glory of the Almighty, the Shonekan family announces the passing of our patriarch, loving husband to Margaret, dutiful father to us all and former Head of State, Chief Ernest, Adegunle, Oladeinde Shonekan, GCFR, CBE, the Baba Sale of Egbaland.” The family said he died of natural causes, adding that further details will be released in due course. The late leader was head of the interim government after Ibrahim Badamosi Babangida, former head of state, stepped down from office. Babangida refused to hand over power to MKO Abiola, the presumed winner of the annulled 1993 presidential election, but the military ruler ”stepped aside”. Shonekan who took charge of the government was in office for only three months. The late Sani Abacha, former military ruler, ousted him through a coup. The statesman hailed from Abeokuta, Ogun state. He attended C.M.S grammar school and Igbobi College, Lagos, and obtained a law degree from the University of London.
