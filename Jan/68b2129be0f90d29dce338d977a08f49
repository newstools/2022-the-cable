The house of representatives has included indirect primary in the electoral act amendment bill. The development comes after the senate deleted clause 87 of the bill which provides for compulsory direct primary poll for all political parties in the country. The lower legislative chamber made the change on Wednesday at the “committee of the whole” after Abubakar Fulata, chairman of the committee on rules and business, sponsored a motion on the bill. The lower legislative chamber had passed the bill in July 2021 and adopted compulsory primary for all political parties. But in December, President Muhammadu Buhari declined assent to the bill, saying compulsory direct primary polls for political parties “violates the spirit of democracy”. While reconsidering the bill on Wednesday, the house amended clause 84 (2) of the bill and adopted that “the procedure for nomination of candidates by political parties for various elective positions shall be by direct and indirect primaries”. The bill’s amendment was not without drama. Earlier, some principal officers including opposition lawmakers had approached Femi Gbajabiamila, speaker of the house. Although the lawmakers could not be heard, it appeared they were in a disagreement as the discussion lasted for about 15 minutes. Subsequently, Gbajabiamila announced a closed-door session.
