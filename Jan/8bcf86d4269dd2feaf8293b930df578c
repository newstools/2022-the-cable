Troops of operation Safe Haven (OPSH) attached to Bauchi, Plateau and Kaduna have intercepted illicit drugs reportedly worth N6.5 million from suspected traffickers in Kaduna. Ishaku Takwa, OPSH spokesperson, disclosed this in a statement on Thursday. Takwa said the troops recovered the illicit substances at a checkpoint along Akwanga-Gwantu road in Sanga LGA of Kaduna. “Troops of OPSH busted another drug syndicate and recovered 315 blocks of substances suspected to be cannabis estimated to be about N6.5 million,” the statement reads. “The substances and Pregabalin capsule were concealed in a car marked AAA 348 BT. “The driver of the Toyota Avensis refused to stop for search at our checkpoint and on pursuit, troops shot at the vehicle.” He said one of the suspects was shot dead while attempting to escape, adding that the family of the deceased had identified the corpse. “Other items recovered from the car include two fake military and Department of State Services (DSS) ID cards bearing the deceased’s name, Motorola radio and N10,000 cash,” he added. In another development, Takwa said troops recovered a vehicle which was abandoned by a suspected trafficker who “fled upon sighting operatives of the OPSH at a checkpoint along Fadan Karshi road in Sanga LGA”. “The troops also recovered 1,610 Pregabalin capsules suspected to be illicit drugs without NAFDAC registration number from an abandoned Ford vehicle marked ABC 318 LU,” he said. “Troops conducted search on the vehicle and discovered large quantity of Pregabalin capsules, 300mg, suspected to be illicit drugs.” According to him, the recovered drugs have been handed to the Plateau command of the National Drug Law Enforcement Agency (NDLEA) and the National Agency for Food and Drug Administration and Control (NAFDAC).
