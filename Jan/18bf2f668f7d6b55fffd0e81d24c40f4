Austin Eguavoen, Super Eagles interim coach, has named his starting lineup for the Africa Cup of Nations (AFCON) Group D game against Sudan. In the lineup released on Saturday, Eguavoen has decided to keep faith with the side that started in the win over Egypt on Tuesday. This means that Taiwo Awoniyi and Kelechi Iheanacho will start the match against Sudan in Garoua while Moses Simon and Samuel Chukwueze attack the North Africans from the flanks. The back four will be coordinated by William Troost-Ekong, Kenneth Omeruo, Ola Aina, and Zaidu Sanusi while Watford-bound Maduka Okoye is expected to be behind the sticks. Wilfred Ndidi and Joe Aribo also have the license to protect the back four. The second Group D encounter between Nigeria and Sudan will kick off at 5 pm in Stade Omnisport Roumde Adia.
