The police in Gombe state have arrested one Hallilu Aliyu, a tricycle rider, for faking his own abduction over a N250,000 debt he owes. Aliyu, 32, was arrested alongside Ahmed Ladan, a 42-year-old man who is suspected to be the rider’s accomplice. The police said trouble started for the rider when he sold the tricycle given to him by his sister for business. They said Aliyu hatched the plan to raise money and pay back his sister who had been asking about the tricycle she gave him. “The first suspect, Haliru Aliyu ‘m’ of Tudun Wada quarters Gombe was given a tricycle to ride by his sister in-law after his business collapsed,” Mary Malum, spokesperson of the Gombe police command, said in a statement. “However, the said suspect later sold the tricycle for N250,000 without the knowledge of the owner. “When the owner asked for the tricycle or her money, the suspect failed to bring any. “Because of the shame, according to him, on December 30, 2021, the suspect went to his friend’s house, the second suspect, one Ahmed Ladan ‘m’, where they criminally conspired and faked a kidnap of the said Haliru Aliyu with the intention to extort his elder sister one Zainab Aliyu ‘f’ aged 42yrs of the same address, the sum of N500,000 to enable him to refund the money.”
