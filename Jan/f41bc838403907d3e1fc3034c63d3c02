Bandits have imposed a N24 million levy on nine communities in Bukkuyum LGA of Zamfara state. In letters delivered to the communities through released captives, the bandits threatened to attack the communities if the levies were not paid promptly. According to Daily Trust, the levied communities are Gaude, Tungar Gebe, Wawan Iccen Ibrahim, Wawan Iccen Salihu, Galle, Nannarki, Ruwan Kura, Gangara and Yargalma. A resident told the newspaper that district heads who have seen the letter alerted the authorities about the development. “The levied communities cut across four districts and some of the villages have started mobilizing to pay the money to avoid raids by the armed criminals,” he said. The communities were asked to pay levies ranging from N5 million to N500,000. The development is coming some days after bandits invaded about five communities located in Bukkuyum and Anka LGAs of the state. Survivors of the attack said bandits killed over 200 villagers and set many houses ablaze but Bello Matawalle, governor of the state, said only 58 people were killed in the attack. In recent times, the spate of bandits’ attacks has heightened in Zamfara with about 703 people reported to have been killed in attacks in 2021, according to a report by TheCableIndex. On Monday, Zamfara governor said there is no immediate end in sight for banditry in his state, adding that some people are behind the attacks for political gains.
