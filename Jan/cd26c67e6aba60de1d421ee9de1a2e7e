Mike Okonkwo, founder of The Redeemed Evangelical Mission (TREM), says religion or tribe should not play a role in electing the country’s next president. The cleric said politicians contesting for the presidential position in 2023 must rid themselves of personal interests. Nigeria’s general election will be held on February 18, 2023. Speaking in an interview on Arise Television on Monday, Okonkwo said the focus should be on who can deliver the dividends of democracy to the people and can ensure that the right things are done. “We must rid ourselves of party politics, religious politics and personal interests as long as the politics of this nation is concerned and focus on who can deliver to us the dividends of democracy,” he said. “I don’t care whether he is a Christian or a Muslim, but who actually is interested in this country, and we have a multitude of them across the length and breadth of Nigeria. “We have done this thing for too long. Religious politics, party politics, tribal politics, where has it led us? For me, it’s time to come to the drawing board and admit that we have failed and start doing the right things.” Okonkwo is a founding member of the Pentecostal Fellowship of Nigeria (PFN).
