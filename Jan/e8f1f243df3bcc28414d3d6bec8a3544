Burkina Faso scored a first-half goal to secure a 1-0 win over Cape Verde in their African Cup of Nations (AFCON) group stage encounter at the Paul Biya Stadium on Thursday night. Boureima Bande scored the only goal of the encounter in 39 minutes to secure Burkina Faso’s first AFCON victory, as they bounced back from the opening day loss to Cameroon. Bande, drafted in to replace Captain Bertrand Traore upfront, met a cross with his chest from a few yards out into an empty net. Kamou Malo’s men dominated from the start and were good value for their goal, with the Stallions hanging on to take maximum points in the first-ever AFCON meeting between both nations. Burkina Faso move level on points with Cape Verde in group A — both with three points from two matches. The two countries have now set up deciders in the final group match for qualification into the knockout stages. Cameroon, however, became the first nation to advance into the knockout stages following a 4-1 win over Ethiopia in the earlier group A match. Vincent Aboubakar, captain of the team, and Karl Toko Ekambi led the Indomitable Lions to victory with two goals apiece, shaking off the Walias despite conceding in the fourth minute. Three of the hosts’ goals were scored in the second half as Antonio Conceicao’s men went on the rampage. Cameroon now top group A with six points. RESULTS
