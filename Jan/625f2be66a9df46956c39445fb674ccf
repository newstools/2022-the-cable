Lai Mohammed, minister of information and culture, says he will initiate a fact-finding process to determine the federal government’s exact position on the removal of petrol subsidy. Mohammed spoke on Wednesday while briefing state house correspondents after a meeting of the federal executive council (FEC) presided over by Vice-President Yemi Osinbajo at the presidential villa, Abuja. The minister’s comment comes on the heels of the statement made by Senate President Ahmad Lawan that President Muhammadu Buhari has not directed the removal of petrol subsidy. “I found it necessary to visit Mr. President, as the leader of our government and our leader in the country, to discuss this particular issue of concern to Nigerians, and I’m happy to inform Nigerians that Mr President never told anyone that the petroleum subsidy should be removed,” Lawan had said. In October, Zainab Ahmed, minister of finance, budget and national planning, had said the federal government would only cater for subsidies on petrol in the first six months of 2022 as it planned to deregulate the downstream oil and gas sector. Ahmed had said N5,000 would be provided as transportation grant to poor Nigerians to cushion the effects of subsidy removal. When asked to clarify the issue of subsidy removal on Wednesday, Mohammed said he needed to consult with the relevant government agencies to determine the exact position on the subsidy removal. “As for the removal of fuel subsidy, I think you will give me time to consult with relevant departments and ministries and I will get back to you,” he said. Speculations that the price of petrol will be increased have stirred up reactions among Nigerians, with the Nigeria Labour Congress (NLC) threatening to embark on a strike action if the federal government goes ahead with the proposed plan.
