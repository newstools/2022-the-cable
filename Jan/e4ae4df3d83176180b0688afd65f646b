Olasupo Shasore, a former Lagos attorney-general and commissioner for justice, is still in the custody of the Economic and Financial Crimes Commission (EFCC). Shasore arrived at the headquarters of the anti-graft commission on Tuesday to answer questions on his involvement in the Process and Industrial Developments (P&ID) case. The former Lagos attorney-general had represented Nigeria on the P&ID case. The P&ID had won a $9.6 billion judgement against Nigeria in a British court. The company claimed it entered a contract to build a gas processing plant in Calabar, Cross River state and that the deal collapsed because the Nigerian government did not fulfil its end of the bargain. Shasore’s grilling by the EFCC comes months after he had spoken of the part he played in representing Nigeria on the P&ID matter. Prior to his speaking on his involvement in the case, the federal government had told a UK court that the former attorney-general colluded with P&ID to avert justice in the controversial gas supply purchasing agreement (GSPA) contract. But P&ID, while denying the allegation before the court, had said Shasore’s argument on the GSPA being void and his questioning of the jurisdiction of the tribunal “would have knocked out P&ID’s entire claim”. Meanwhile, Shasore’s interrogation by the EFCC comes months before a dispute between Nigeria and P&ID is scheduled for trial in the United Kingdom.
