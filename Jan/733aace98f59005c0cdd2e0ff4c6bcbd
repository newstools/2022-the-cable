The Ambassadors of Voice for Change, a group of Nollywood actors and entertainers, has honoured Femi Adesina, presidential spokesman, with a merit award. Adesina received the award from the group, led by Ahmed Bala, at Aso Rock, Abuja on Friday. In his remark, Ben Kure, the group’s spokesman, said Adesina has distinguished himself as a journalist, writer, media executive, and spokesperson of the president. According to Kure, the presidential spokesman has “written his name in gold” in the media profession and discharge of his duties. ”He has been adjudged the best spokesman by journalists in Nigeria and one of the reasons adduced to this feat is his humility and accessibility, he deeply cares about the welfare of journalists in Nigeria,” he said. In his response, Adesina commended the group’s gesture and its efforts towards promoting the unity of the country. The presidential spokesman said what the country needs currently are peacemakers who will entrench nationalism and patriotism in the polity and not spoilers. He added that President Muhammadu Buhari’s administration would continue to support Nigerians working assiduously to promote peace, harmony, and development. ”What you are doing for the country makes our work easier. When you hold town hall meetings in different parts of the country, advocating for unity, peace and change, it is easier for me to do the job and I am very glad to identify with this group, which is nationalistic and patriotic,” he said. Members of the group at the event include Gentle Jack, Saheed Balogun, Mr Ibu, Shina Peters and Onyekweli Harry B.
