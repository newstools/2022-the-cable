Onyema Nwachukwu, army public relations director, says troops of operation Hadin Kai have killed three Boko Haram/ISWAP terrorists in an encounter at Damask in Borno. Nwachukwu made this known in a statement issued on Saturday. He said the troops recorded a “decisive victory” against the terrorists on Friday. He said the troops came in contact with the insurgents at an illegal market in Gallo Malawari village while conducting clearance operations. “In the fierce encounter, three BH/ISWAP terrorists were neutralised, while others, bowing to superior firepower retreated in disarray,” he said in the statement. “Troops recovered one AK 47 Rifle, a truck, two motorcycles, four empty magazines and rounds of 7.62mm ammunition amongst others.”
