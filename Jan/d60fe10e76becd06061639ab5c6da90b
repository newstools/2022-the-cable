Nyesom Wike, governor of Rivers, has asked the commissioner of police in the state to provide security for LG chairpersons during clampdown on illegal refining sites. According to a statement by Kelvin Ebiri, the governor’s spokesperson, Wike said this on Wednesday at a meeting with security agencies and LG officials. The governor had said his administration will not tolerate illegal oil refining activities, considering the effects on the environment. Speaking at the meeting on Wednesday, Wike said the state government will support the LG chairpersons with what they need to dismantle illegal oil refining operations in their areas. “I will not relent in this fight. And all of you should hire bulldozers. All those areas where the illegal refinery sites are in the bush, in the creek, clear the place. Government will give you some money to go and hire bulldozers to go and clear the sites so that they will know we are serious,” he said. “One thing I want to say and which is very clear, and like everybody knows, I am not against anybody making money. But, we cannot allow people to make money while others are dying.” He noted that the state has recorded a significant success in the fight against illegal refineries, adding that he is cautious of persons who might want to use security operatives to undermine the efforts of the government. “You know in Nigeria, we don’t believe that anything can happen. We don’t take government seriously, but in our own case, they have no choice. They’ll take us seriously,” he added.
