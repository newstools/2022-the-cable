The sit-at-home order issued by the Indigenous People of Biafra (IPOB) in the south-east in solidarity with Nnamdi Kanu, its leader, paralysed economic activities in Owerri, Imo state capital, on Tuesday. TheCable went round major parts of Owerri and observed that many shops and business premises were locked in compliance with the order issued by IPOB. Schools, banks and major markets like Orji market, Douglas Market, Relief Market and many shops were not opened for business. Below are photos. <img class="alignnone wp-image-651315" src="https://f5p3e9e4.stackpathcdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/Imo-Sit-At-Home3.png" alt="" width="550" height="227" srcset="https://f5p3e9e4.stackpathcdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/Imo-Sit-At-Home3.png 963w, https://f5p3e9e4.stackpathcdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/Imo-Sit-At-Home3-300x124.png 300w, https://f5p3e9e4.stackpathcdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/Imo-Sit-At-Home3-768x317.png 768w, https://f5p3e9e4.stackpathcdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/Imo-Sit-At-Home3-24x10.png 24w, https://f5p3e9e4.stackpathcdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/Imo-Sit-At-Home3-36x15.png 36w, https://f5p3e9e4.stackpathcdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/Imo-Sit-At-Home3-48x20.png 48w" sizes="(max-width: 550px) 100vw, 550px" /> <img class="alignnone wp-image-651316" src="https://f5p3e9e4.stackpathcdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/Imo-Sit-At-Home2.png" alt="" width="550" height="293" srcset="https://f5p3e9e4.stackpathcdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/Imo-Sit-At-Home2.png 806w, https://f5p3e9e4.stackpathcdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/Imo-Sit-At-Home2-300x160.png 300w, https://f5p3e9e4.stackpathcdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/Imo-Sit-At-Home2-768x410.png 768w, https://f5p3e9e4.stackpathcdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/Imo-Sit-At-Home2-24x13.png 24w, https://f5p3e9e4.stackpathcdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/Imo-Sit-At-Home2-36x19.png 36w, https://f5p3e9e4.stackpathcdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/Imo-Sit-At-Home2-48x26.png 48w" sizes="(max-width: 550px) 100vw, 550px" /> <img class="alignnone wp-image-651319" src="https://f5p3e9e4.stackpathcdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/Imo-Sit-At-Home1.png" alt="" width="550" height="290" srcset="https://f5p3e9e4.stackpathcdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/Imo-Sit-At-Home1.png 801w, https://f5p3e9e4.stackpathcdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/Imo-Sit-At-Home1-300x158.png 300w, https://f5p3e9e4.stackpathcdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/Imo-Sit-At-Home1-768x405.png 768w, https://f5p3e9e4.stackpathcdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/Imo-Sit-At-Home1-24x13.png 24w, https://f5p3e9e4.stackpathcdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/Imo-Sit-At-Home1-36x19.png 36w, https://f5p3e9e4.stackpathcdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/Imo-Sit-At-Home1-48x25.png 48w" sizes="(max-width: 550px) 100vw, 550px" />
