Godwin Obaseki, governor of Edo, says Nigeria’s unity shouldn’t be taken for granted as it was “achieved on the blood of fallen heroes”. According to NAN, Obaseki said this on Saturday at an event to mark the 2022 armed forces remembrance day in Benin, the Edo capital. He also advised Nigerians to guard their utterances concerning calls for the country’s disintegration. “The unity of this country has been achieved on the blood of our fallen heroes. It is not something we should take for granted or joke with,” he said. “People are still sacrificing in the various arenas and battles in the country today. We shouldn’t take it lightly. “We are here today to remember gallant Nigerian soldiers and members of the armed forces who lost their lives in the course of defending our country. “We are here today because people gave up their lives. People must understand that such careless talks cost lives, and we should not lead ourselves where history will repeat itself in this country.” He added that his administration will not relent in supporting the families of soldiers who died in service to the country. He also assured citizens of the government’s commitment towards investing in security.
