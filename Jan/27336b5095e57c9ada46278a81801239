Nigeria on Monday recorded 670 cases of COVID-19. Here are five updates about the pandemic this Tuesday. US approves Pfizer COVID booster shot for 12- to 15-year-olds The US Food and Drug Administration has authorised the use of a third dose of the Pfizer and BioNTech COVID-19 vaccine for children between the ages of 12 and 15. The drug regulator also reduced the interval for booster shot eligibility from six to five months. The agency also authorised a third shot for children aged five to 11 who are immunocompromised. “Based on the FDA’s assessment of currently available data, a booster dose of the currently authorized vaccines may help provide better protection against both the Delta and Omicron variants,” Peter Marks, director of the FDA’s Center for Biologics Evaluation and Research, said. Danish study: Omicron bypass immunity better than Delta A Danish study says the Omicron COVID variant is better at evading the immunity of vaccinated peoples than the Delta variant. The study, conducted by researchers at the University of Copenhagen, Statistics Denmark and Statens Serum Institut (SSI), suggests the variant spreads more rapidly because it is better at bypassing immunity obtained from vaccines. The researchers studied 12,000 Danish households and found that Omicron was 2.7 to 3.7 times more infectious than the Delta variant among vaccinated Danes. “Our findings confirm that the rapid spread of the Omicron (variant) primarily can be ascribed to the immune evasiveness rather than an inherent increase in the basic transmissibility,” the researchers said. Nigeria records 670 infections Nigeria recorded an increase in its daily COVID cases on Monday. The Nigeria Centre for Disease Control (NCDC) says 670 cases were reported across the country compared to the 573 recorded on Sunday.
