David Umahi, governor of Ebonyi, has said the presidential ticket of the All Progressives Congress (APC) should be zoned to the south-east for “equity and fairness”. Umahi, who on Tuesday declared his intention to be the party’s standard-bearer at the 2023 presidential election, spoke in a chat with Arise TV on Wednesday. The governor said, given the “sentiment being expressed by all the sectors of the society”, APC should zone its presidential ticket to the south-east “to enable the nation move forward”. Umahi, who joined the APC in 2020 because of the “injustice” done to the south-east by the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) on presidential zoning, however, added that he “will not feel any sense of injustice” if the party does not lean toward his ambition or that of the south-east region. “I’m still a new person in the APC, and whatever thing I get in terms of my desire, I will consider favour from God and leaders of the party. I will not feel any sense of injustice,” he said. “But looking at it generally about the sentiment being expressed by all the sectors of the society and to move the nation forward and for absolute unity and peace, it’s important that equity, fairness and justice should come to be and to enable the nation move forward. “And nobody is saying, ‘if you don’t zone it to the south-east, the nation will not move forward’, but I think that if a nation is built on equity and fairness then there is going to be progress and prosperity. So you can understand that I’m new in the house and whatever happens in terms of my desire and that of the south-east is a favour.”
