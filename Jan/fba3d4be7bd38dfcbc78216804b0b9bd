Passengers can now travel to Ibadan on Friday at the train station by 8 pm, 12 pm and 4 pm, while on Saturday, the train movement will depart at 8 pm, 1 pm and 6 pm. Meanwhile, the Lagos-Ibadan train schedule for Monday to Thursday, including Sunday, remains intact with 8 pm and 4 pm trips. In December 2021, the federal government declared free train rides for citizens from December 24 to January 4, 2022. According to the federal government, the decision will ease transportation costs and enable easy movement.
