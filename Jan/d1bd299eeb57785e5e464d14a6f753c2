Novak Djokovic, the men’s world number one tennis star, may be barred from competing in this year’s French Open for not getting vaccinated against COVID-19. This was after France’s sports ministry declared on Monday that “there’s no exemption” for unvaccinated athletes at the competition. According to Reuters, the new declaration is in tandem with a new vaccine pass law which was passed by the French parliament on Sunday. The new law will require people to have a certificate of vaccination to enter public places such as restaurants, cafes, cinemas, and long-distance trains. The development is in contradiction with the position shared by Roxana Maracineanu, the country’s sports minister, last week, where she had said competitions like the French Open have “protocols” that could allow unvaccinated athletes like Djokovic to participate. In the new statement, the sports ministry stated that the rule would take effect “as soon as the law is promulgated.” It added that although the situation “may change” before the competition serves off in May, if it remains, “there’s no exemption.” “The rule is simple. The vaccine pass will be imposed, as soon as the law is promulgated, in establishments that were already subject to the health pass,” the statement added. “This will apply to everyone who is a spectator or a professional sportsperson. And this until further notice. “Now, as far as Roland Garros is concerned, it’s in May. The situation may change between now and then and we hope that it will be more favourable. So we’ll see, but clearly, there’s no exemption.” Djokovic, who has refused to take the COVID vaccine, was prevented from competing at the Australian Open after losing the second visa cancellation appeal case against the country’s government.
