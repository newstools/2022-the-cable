Samuel Aruwan, commissioner for internal security and home affairs in Kaduna, says five bandits were killed during an attempt to attack a community in Kwanan Bataro, Giwa LGA of the state. In a statement on Monday, Aruwan said troops were conducting clearance patrol when they got information of the attack. He said Nasir el-Rufai, governor of Kaduna, was satisfied with the operational feedback and commended the troops for their “proactive and sharp response to the intelligence received”. He added that the governor encouraged the security operatives to sustain the intensity of surveillance and ongoing offensive against gunmen in the area. “According to the operational feedback, the troops who were conducting clearance patrols in Giwa LGA received credible intelligence of terrorists’ movement towards Fatika town,” Aruwan said. “The troops then mobilised to Marke and Ruheya in response. The outlaws were sighted and attempted to escape the advancing forces. “The troops, however, cut off their escape route at Kwanan Bataro, and engaged them in a firefight, during which five of the terrorists were neutralised. “The troops returned to base after clearing the area.” The development comes days after bandits attacked some communities in Giwa LGA and killed 40 people.
