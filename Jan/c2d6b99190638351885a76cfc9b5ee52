At least eight people have been killed, with several others injured following a stampede during Cameroon and Comoros match at the ongoing Africa Cup of Nations (AFCON). An official of the Confederation of African Football (CAF), who confirmed the incident to TheCable, said the stampede occurred after thousands of fans attempted to force their way into the Olembe Stadium in Yaounde on Monday. Cameroon won the match 2-1 against a depleted Comoros team that had a left-back playing in-between the sticks after the team was hit by COVID-19 crisis. Toko Ekambi and Vincent Aboubakar both scored to cancel out a Youssouf M’Changama’s free-kick to send the Indomitable Lions into the quarter-finals. However, the casualties from the game left a bitter taste in the aftermath of the victory for the hosts. Video clips also shared on social media show some fans laying injured on the ground while others storm out of the stadium. Speaking on the incident, CAF said an investigation has been opened into the cause of the stampede. “CAF is aware of the incident that took place at Olembe Stadium during the TotalEnergies Africa Cup of Nations fixture between hosts Cameroon and Comoros tonight, 24 January 2022,” a statement by the continent football governing body read. “CAF is currently investigating the situation and trying to get more details on what transpired. We are in constant communication with the Cameroon government and the Local Organizing Committee.”
