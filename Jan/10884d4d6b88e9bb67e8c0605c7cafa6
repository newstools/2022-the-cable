Federal Otokito, the Bayelsa commissioner for industry, trade and investment, who was abducted by gunmen on January 20, has regained his freedom. Otokito was released by his abductors on Monday after he was kidnapped from his residence in Otuokpoti community, Ogbia LGA of the state. Ben Nebolisa, Bayelsa commissioner of police, and Mohammed Abdullahi, the director of the state security service, presented Otokito to Douye Diri, governor of Bayelsa, at the Government House, Yenagoa. Speaking at a media briefing following Otokito’s release, the governor announced the deposition of A.C.T. Wongo, the paramount ruler of Otuokpoti community, and appointed Rescue Abe to take over in acting capacity. The governor also sacked Azibalua Amon, the development committee chairman of the community, and replaced him with Jerry Offor in acting capacity, while Emolem Igue, the youth president, was replaced with Shedrach Afiemo. According to Diri, preliminary investigation revealed that those relieved of their positions were complicit in the kidnap of the commissioner, adding that the incident was linked to illegal oil refining activities in the area. “I’ll like to thank God that a member of the state exco who was kidnapped is now here with us,” he said. “I’ll like to also thank the security agencies and all other sources that helped in securing the release of the commissioner. “Investigation is ongoing. So, we appeal to all in Otuokpoti to keep the peace and security agencies will keep an eagle eye on Otuokpoti and environs. “Bayelsa will not condone crime and criminality. We have zero tolerance for crime. Let this be a warning to all those who have taken that as a way of life that Bayelsa is not a state for them. “We have anti-kidnapping laws and they will be invoked at all times. As a government, we will do everything to ensure peace for people of the state.”
