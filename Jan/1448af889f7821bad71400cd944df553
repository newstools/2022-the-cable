Babajide Sanwo-Olu, governor of Lagos, has called on Nigerians to appreciate the army instead of criticising them. Sanwo-Olu said this during a Jumat service held to commemorate the 2022 Armed Forces Remembrance Day, held at the community central mosque in Ikeja, Lagos. The Armed Forces Remembrance Day (AFRD), also known as Remembrance Day, is observed every January 15 in honour of officers. The governor, who was represented by Obafemi Hamzat, his deputy, said Nigerians had formed the habit of criticising the nation, adding that other countries have their challenges but don’t do such. “All we do is criticise. We even criticise the Nigerian Army, that they are not fighting well. We always elevate the bad things about our country,” NAN quoted him as saying. “How do we justify the death of those people that fought for this country to remain? In memory of the people that have even died, let us even be nice to our country. “Whether we like it or not, if we do not build it, all of us will suffer. It is as simple as that. “We should do everything to prevent war. Some people have voluntarily said they will protect all of us with the help of Allah to defend this country. Therefore, we must appreciate them. “We pray that Almighty Allah will be with the souls of those that have departed. For those that are living, it is our responsibility to do everything that we should to appreciate their efforts.”
