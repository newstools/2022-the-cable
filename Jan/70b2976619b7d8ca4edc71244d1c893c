Emmanuel Leweh, chairman of Akwanga local government council in Nasarawa state, is dead. Addra Ibrahim, chief press secretary to the governor, confirmed the development on Friday. Leweh had reportedly slumped on Monday in his office at the council secretariat in Akwanga area. He was also said to have been admitted to a private hospital in Abuja, where he died on Thursday night. He assumed office as the Akwanga LG chairman in October 2021. Following a condolence visit to his family on Friday, Abdullahi Sule, governor of Nasarawa, described Leweh as a “vibrant gentleman and visionary leader who made great contributions to the development of the council and the state at large”. “In only a few months into his three-year tenure, the young man has shown great courage, leadership and sincere commitment to uniting the people of the area and steering the council on the path of accelerated growth,” Sule said, according to a statement by Ibrahim. The governor also described the incident as “a huge loss to the Mada nation in particular and the state in general”, and urged youths in the area to “consider the death as the will of God”.
