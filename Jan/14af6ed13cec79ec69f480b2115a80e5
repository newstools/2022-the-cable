The performance of the Super Eagles of Nigeria at their Africa Cup of Nations (AFCON) opening match against the Pharaohs of Egypt, has attracted reactions from social media. The match, which took place at the Roumdé Adjia stadium in Cameroon on Tuesday, saw Kelechi Iheanacho score the only goal of the match, putting the Super Eagles in charge of group D. The Leicester forward put the Eagles ahead in the 30th minute with a stunning, long-range shot. Following the victory, fans of the national team have taken to Twitter to express their excitement, while praising the team and their coach, Austin Eguavoen. Here are some reactions from Twitter. This our Super Eagles team, just add Osimhen somewhere up front there and we will beat Arsenal, Man. Utd and even Barcelona. — Adewale Adetona (@iSlimfit) January 11, 2022  The Super Eagles actually thwarted the Egyptian Team and gave a good account of themselves. I’m very impressed by the way we played and curbed Mo Salah. More importantly, I am relieved that Ndidi did not suffer an injury.
Well done, Super Eagles!!! — Frank Edoho (@frankedoho) January 11, 2022  Nigeria the first of the “big” nations at #afcon2021 to look 100% match sharp and up to speed. And this is a team that sacked their manager last month! Impressive stuff so far from the Super Eagles. — John Bennett (@JohnBennettBBC) January 11, 2022  See as super eagles made my day. Feeling like someone credited my account. — Timi Dakolo (@timidakolo) January 11, 2022  Nigerian Super Eagles easily showing Ghana Black stars how it’s done. Once again, I blame Nigerians for not showing us the way  #AFCON2021#TeamGhana#TeamNigeria — DKB GHANA (@dkbghana) January 11, 2022
