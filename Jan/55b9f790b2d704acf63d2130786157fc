The Popoyemoja Palace says the late Saliu Adetunji, Olubadan of Ibadan, will be buried today. The Olubadan died at the University College Hospital, Ibadan, Oyo state in the early hours of Sunday. In a statement on Sunday, Adeola Oloko, the oba’s director of media, said the deceased monarch will be buried today at 4pm according to Islamic rites. “The 41st Olubadan of Ibadanland, and Chairman, Oyo State Council of Obas and Chiefs, Oba Saliu Akanmu Adetunji, Aje Ogungunniso 1 has joined his ancestor,” the statement reads. “Oba Adetunji, 93 passed away in the early hours of this morning at the University College Hospital, UCH, Ibadan. “He is survived by his wife, Olori Rashidat Ololade Adetunji, Children, grandchildren and great-grandchildren. He will be buried at 4.00 pm today at his Popoyemoja, Ibadan Palace according to Muslim rites. Other things follow later.” The monarch was the 41st king of the ancient city, and he succeeded Oba Samuel Odulana who died in 2016. His death came 22 days after the demise of another Oyo king, Jimoh Oladunni Oyewumi, Ajagungbade III, the Soun of Ogbomoso. Adetunji’s succession to the throne was intriguing as two candidates to the throne before him died before they reached the height of the royal ascendancy system in 2016. The Olubadan was born on August 26, 1928 to the family of Raji Olayiwola and Suwebat Amope Adetunji in Alusekere compound, Popoyemoja, Ibadan. He was the eldest of his father’s 17 children. His mother was from the Balogun family of Apomu and as of the time he ascended the throne in 2016, the departed monarch and his brother, Ambali were the only surviving children of the mother’s four children.
