Ado Doguwa, the majority leader of the house of representatives, has welcomed his 28th child. Doguwa disclosed this while speaking on the floor of the house during plenary session on Tuesday. Ndudi Elumelu, minority leader of the house, had congratulated Doguwa on the birth of his child. Responding, Doguwa said: “This is no longer news. It is no longer news because this thing happened in the last 24 hours. It is true that my beloved family has gotten an additional one person. It is a bouncing baby girl. “The mother and the baby are hale and hearty. The husband is still active. I am here and I thank God that I kept my word with the house that while I had 27, I promised you that I would continue counting. By the grace of God and your prayers, the count would continue. “Now that we are considering the electoral act amendment and when we get to the floor, perhaps in the ‘committee of the whole’, I would appeal to my members so that we suspend relevant rules and we have a clause in the electoral act where it permits families that do have up to 30 kids come to have an electoral polling unit in that family.” When Femi Gbajabiamila, speaker of the house, inquired if he was working on a voting unit in his home, Ado-Doguwa replied: “At least between now and 2023 before the elections come, if you allow that, then I would have a polling unit within my home.” In 2020, the lawmaker representing Doguwa/Tudun Wada federal constituency in Kano, had said he has 27 children and hopes to have more. At the time, the legislator also said he has four wives.
