Recently, a Facebook page — Biafra Today News — posted a picture showing Micheal Collins Ajereh, Nigerian music producer better known as Don Jazzy, in a Biafra-themed outfit. The Facebook page, which has over 14,000 followers, shared the picture of Don Jazzy with a caption suggesting that the music producer is showing support for the actualisation of Biafra. “We winning. Biafra is nonnegotiable full stop,” the caption reads. The background of the picture also has the photograph of Nnamdi Kanu, leader of the proscribed Indigenous People of Biafra (IPOB). The post, which was published on January 11, has garnered over 2,000 comments and 819 shares. <img class="alignnone size-large wp-image-651756" src="https://f5p3e9e4.stackpathcdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/Fake-News_Don-Jazzy-photo-634x1024.jpg" alt="" width="600" height="1024" /> A glance through the comment section shows many Facebook users who commented on the post believed that Don Jazzy has publicly identified with the secessionist movement. “Nice one God bless Biafra,” Chijioke Onah, a Facebook user, commented on the post. “Looking so sweet oh, God bless Biafra,” Onyebuchi Nwachukwu, another user commented. “Am proud of you God will perfect what he has started Amen,” Iyke Calvin said. VERIFICATION TheCable fact-check desk subjected the image to error level analysis on fotoforensics, a platform that provides tools for digital photo forensics. The result shows incoherent colours at the shoulder and waist regions of the Biafra-themed outfit. The frame showing Kanu’s picture also exhibits traces of incoherent colours. The result of the analysis, which can be viewed here, shows that the picture had been digitally modified with the Biafra-themed outfit imposed on the original picture. Error level analysis of the photoshopped picture on fotoforensics A quick review of Don Jazzy’s verified social media accounts shows that the music producer posted the original picture on his Instagram page on January 4. In the original picture, the music producer wore an orange-coloured suit, not the Biafra-themed outfit.
