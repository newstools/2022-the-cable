Air Peace has announced the introduction of a priority boarding policy for Nigeria’s military personnel — both serving and retired. In a statement on Friday, Allen Onyema, the airline‘s chief executive officer, said the initiative was a way of honouring them for the huge sacrifices they make for the nation. Onyema said the airline holds the contributions of the military in securing Nigeria and defending its territory from external aggression in high esteem. He said the new policy of boarding military personnel first before other passengers had commenced on Wednesday, January 12, 2022. He said the policy has become a permanent practice in all Air Peace stations. “This priority boarding policy we are introducing is our own way of appreciating and recognising the noble and patriotic efforts of the officers and men of Nigeria’s Armed Forces, for the risks they take and all the sacrifices they make in defending the territorial integrity of this country,” Onyema said. “Our ground staff have also been enjoined to appreciate them.” The Air Peace CEO asked other passengers to show understanding and cooperate with the airline’s ground personnel to ensure a seamless implementation of the new boarding procedure. He encouraged other businesses to adopt a similar policy in honour of the Nigerian military. In September 2021, Air Peace the became the official airline sponsor of the Nigerian national teams. The sponsorship deal is worth N300 million and renewable at the expiration of one year.
