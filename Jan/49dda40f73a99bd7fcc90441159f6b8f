The Liverpool goal poacher told TheCable that there is pressure on the Egyptian team to win the tournament. The seven-time AFCON winners are gearing up to face the Nigerian side at Roumde Adjia Stadium in Garoua on Tuesday. When asked for his take on Ahmed Musa’s comment on Eagles having more dangerous players than him, Salah said: “I don’t think there is a need to reply to him because he is someone I respect so much. “Super Eagles have a good team but we would do our best to defeat them. “Both teams have good players, they have the chance to win. We will do our best to win tomorrow.” The former Chelsea, Fiorentina and Roma forward admitted that he is keen to win his first AFCON title. “There is pressure to win the AFCON tournament,” he added. “This is the title I am yet to win. I have always wanted to win something for Egypt. “The team always comes first and we can do something this time around. We have a good coach and good team. We will do our best to make our people proud.”
