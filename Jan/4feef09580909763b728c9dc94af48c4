The All Progressives Congress (APC) says the killings in Zamfara state will not go unpunished. Last week, gunmen reportedly killed over 60 people in a raid on communities located in Bukkuyum and Anka LGAs of the state. In a statement on Monday, John Akpanudoedehe, national secretary of the APC national caretaker committee, said the designation of these gunmen as terrorists will make security agencies deal with them. Akpanudoedehe said the terrorists are fleeing their enclaves because of operations undertaken by the security agencies. “Indeed, the recent designation of these satanic, evil and criminal elements as terrorist groups will further buoy our security services to deal with them as such and ultimately contain their nefarious activities in the country,” he said. “The APC Caretaker/Extraordinary Convention Planning Committee led by Governor Mai Mala Buni expresses heartfelt condolences to the families that lost loved ones and commiserates with the government and people of Zamfara state. “The killings in Zamfara state and elsewhere will not go unpunished. “We commend and urge support for the military and other security services whose concerted onslaught on the camps of the criminals is ensuring the rescue of kidnapped citizens and neutralising the criminal elements. “Already, the terrorists (formerly bandits) are now fleeing as troops clearance operations has forced their dislodgement from their enclaves. We urge Nigerians to watch out and report any suspicious movement. “The President Muhammadu Buhari government has been steadfast in retooling the Armed Forces, recruitment of personnel and intensified training to enhance their operational capacity in safeguarding public safety and the territorial integrity of the country.”
