We will respect our opponents. We will have the same enthusiasm. It is not expected that the game will be smooth for 90 minutes. Our major concern is conversion. We have worked on that and we hope to see improvements. Some countries tend to raise their game when they face Nigeria. We will be ready.” Those were the words of Austin Eguavon, Super Eagles interim coach, when he spoke about his team’s preparation for their third game at the 2022 Africa Cup of Nations (AFCON). The Super Eagles, sharp and in-form in recent games, are looking to maintain their unblemished record at this year’s tournament when they take on Guinea-Bissau on Wednesday night. Nigeria have already qualified for the round of 16, while Guinea-Bissau seek to join the Super Eagles in the knockout stages. The Super Eagles made it two wins from as many games following a 3-1 victory over Sudan on Saturday. Goals from Samuel Chukwueze, Taiwo Awoniyi and Moses Simon helped the three-time African champions defeat the North African side. Wednesday’s game offers an opportunity to keep the juggernaut rolling against an opposing side who were unlucky in their last game. Having picked up just one point in the group stage and with nothing to lose, Guinea-Bissau will approach the match fired up with the zeal to achieve the seemingly unlikely feat of recording a win. Off the back of an opening-day draw against Sudan, Guinea-Bissau were beaten 1-0 by Egypt in their second group fixture on Saturday. The game was decided in the second half courtesy of a Mo Salah goal which condemned Baciro Cande’s men to a defeat. It was the first defeat in four outings for the Djurtus since suffering a 3-0 loss to Morocco in the World Cup qualifiers. Currently sitting third in Group D, the Djurtus head into the final matchday with their destiny still in their hands as they look to progress into the next phase of the tournament. Guinea-Bissau’s possible starting lineup: Jonas Mendes, Bura, Fali Candé, Opa Sangante, Moreto Cassamá, Sori Mane, Panutche Camará, Piqueti, Mama Baldé, Steve Ambri, Jefferson Encada. Nigeria’s possible starting lineup: Francis Uzoho, Tyrone Ebuehi, Zaidu Sanusi, Semi Ajayi, William Troost-Ekong, Kelechi Nwakali, Wilfred Ndidi, Chidera Ejuke, Peter Olayinka, Kelechi Iheanacho, Moses Simon.
