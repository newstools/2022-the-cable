Saliu Adetunji, the Olubadan of Ibadan, has died at the age of 93. The monarch was the 41st king of the ancient city, and he succeeded Oba Samuel Odulana who died in 2016. The Olubadan died at the University College Hospital, Ibadan in the early hours of Sunday. His death came 22 days after the demise of another Oyo king, Jimoh Oladunni Oyewumi, Ajagungbade III, the Soun of Ogbomoso. Although Adeola Oloko, director of media and publicity to the monarch, did not respond to calls when contacted, a palace source said the king has joined his ancestors. “It is what you have heard. Olubadan Adetunji has gone to join his ancestors,” he said. Adetunji’s succession to the throne was intriguing as two candidates to the throne before him died before they reached the height of the royal ascendancy system in 2016. Adetunji was born on August 26, 1928 to the family of Raji Olayiwola and Suwebat Amope Adetunji in Alusekere compound, Popoyemoja, Ibadan. He was the eldest of his father’s 17 children. His mother was from the Balogun family of Apomu and as of the time he ascended the throne in 2016, the departed monarch and his brother, Ambali were the only surviving children of the mother’s four children.
