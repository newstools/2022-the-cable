Abubakar Abdulsalam, father of Hanifa Abubakar, a five-year-old pupil who was allegedly killed by her teacher in Kano, says he’ll never forget the incident till he dies. The pupil was kidnapped in December and her abductors had demanded N6 million ransom. On Thursday, the police in Kano arrested Abdulmalik Tanko, Abubakar’s teacher who allegedly abducted and killed her. The police had said Tanko confessed that he kidnapped the victim and took her to his house where he contacted her relatives and demanded the ransom. “On the 18/12/2021, having realised that the victim recognised him, he claimed to have poisoned her to death, conspired with one Hashim Isyaku, ‘m’, took and buried her in a shallow grave located at the private school premises located at Kwanar ‘Yan Gana, Tudun Murtala Quarters, Nassarawa LGA, Kano State,” the police said in a statement. The body was exhumed and taken to Mohammed Abdullahi Wase Specialist Hospital Kano where she was confirmed dead. Speaking with journalists on Friday, the mourning father expressed sadness over the incident. “I’m really in sorrow for what happened. I can only thank God. This can happen to anyone and it is said that everyone who lives will die someday. So I leave everything to God. But till I die, I will never forget this. Those who did this to me have not been fair to me neither have they been fair to the world. God will fight for me,” he said in a video posted by Daily Trust. “I am also thanking the Nigerian security forces, especially those whose efforts found my murdered daughter. May God fight for our rights. I am sincerely grateful to you. I can’t thank you enough, only God can reward you.” Meanwhile, the Kano state government has ordered the immediate closure of Noble Kids Academy, the private school where the body of the five-year-old was buried. The police had said the suspects will be charged to court upon completion of the investigation.
