The Governor’s Advisory Council (GAC), the highest decision-making body of the All Progressives Congress (APC) in Lagos, says it has not picked a candidate to replace Babajide Sanwo-Olu, governor of the state, for the 2023 governorship election. In a statement issued over the weekend, Mutiu Are, GAC secretary, asked the public to disregard speculations that the party leaders and stakeholders have settled for a replacement for Sanwo-Olu. GAC also urged the governor not to be distracted from delivering good governance to the people of Lagos. “The GAC has not settled for any person to replace Mr. Babajide Sanwo-Olu as governor. Therefore, it is absolutely false and preposterous for anyone to suggest so,” the statement reads. “The process of picking a Governor is clearly stated in the constitution. And contrary to the false impression the merchant of hate, confusion, discord and disharmony wanted to create with the post, there is no discussion of second term ticket by the GAC. “It should also be pointed out that it is not within the realm of GAC to engage in picking replacements for a governor. “Importantly, the Independent National Electoral Commission has not signaled the commencement of the process for governorship election in Lagos State. “Governor Sanwo-Olu was elected for a four-year tenure which is still ongoing. The matter of replacement of the governor does not arise and is patently sub-judice. “Governor Sanwo-Olu is doing a wonderful job delivering infrastructure projects for Lagos and working daily on making the state better for all its residents.”
