Moses Simon, Super Eagles winger, has attributed his improved performance at the Africa Cup of Nations (AFCON) to the “freedom” bestowed upon him by Austin Eguavoen. Simon was the most outstanding performer for the Eagles in their 1-0 victory over Egypt on Tuesday. He was a willing outlet on the team’s left-wing throughout his entire stay on the pitch, contributing to the lone goal that secured the match for Nigeria. Simon was a menace to the Pharaohs’ defence, with persistent take-ons that the defenders failed to curtail. His performance earned him a high score in TheCable’s rating of the Eagles. Speaking to reporters in Garoua on Friday, Simon said he has been given the “freedom to produce” as he does at his club. Simon said under Gernot Rohr, the former coach, he had to play to instructions. “Of course, It was my best performance in the last two years. You know we changed the coach and, of course, the tactics. So every coach has his own mentality and how he impacts players,” he said. “With the previous coach, I played on his instructions, but the current coach gives the freedom and allows us to bring our style of play at our clubs.” Super Eagles lead the pack in Group D with three points and will be hoping for another win to book a place in the second round when they face Sudan on Saturday at 5pm.
