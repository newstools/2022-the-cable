President Muhammadu Buhari says his administration will “smoke out” the bandits who killed over 200 residents of Zamfara communities. TheCable had reported how bandits invaded about five communities located in Bukkuyum and Anka LGAs of the state between Wednesday night and Thursday morning. Survivors of the attack said the bandits killed over 200 villagers and set many houses ablaze. Ibrahim Dosara, Zamfara commissioner for information, reportedly blamed informants for the attacks. Speaking on the incident, Buhari, in a statement on Saturday, described the incident as an “act of desperation by mass murderers” who are “under relentless pressure” from the military. The president assured Zamfara residents that the army and the airforce are working together to track and eliminate the perpetrators. “The latest attacks on innocent people by the bandits is an act of desperation by mass murderers, now under relentless pressure from our military forces who are well equipped to effectively confront these enemies of humanity,” Buhari said. “In keeping with my commitment to tackle the monster of terrorism head on, let me reassure these besieged communities and other Nigerians that this government will not abandon them to their fate because we are more than ever determined to get rid of these outlaws. “These criminals will be history because we are not going to relent in our current military operations to get rid of these thugs who have been terrorising innocent people. “We are fiercely determined to smoke out and destroy these outlaws who have no regard for the sanctity of life. “The army and the airforce are working together to get rid of these callous criminals as they acquire more equipment to track down and eliminate criminal gangs that are subjecting innocent people to the reign of terror, including illegal imposition of taxes on the communities under siege.”
