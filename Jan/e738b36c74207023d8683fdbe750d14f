Olasupo Shasore, a former attorney-general and commissioner for justice in Lagos, is being questioned by the Economic and Financial Crimes Commission (EFCC) over his involvement in the Process and Industrial Developments (P&ID) case. A source disclosed the development to TheCable on Tuesday. The former Lagos commissioner, who had represented Nigeria at the beginning of the P&ID case, is said to have arrived the EFCC headquarters in Abuja on Tuesday afternoon. The P&ID had won a $9.6 billion judgement against Nigeria in a British court. The company claimed it entered a contract to build a gas processing plant in Calabar, Cross River state and that the deal collapsed because the Nigerian government did not fulfil its end of the bargain. TheCable had reported in July 2020 that the federal government had told a UK court that Shasore colluded with P&ID to avert justice in the controversial gas supply purchasing agreement (GSPA) contract. But P&ID had denied the allegation, stating that had the argument on the GSPA being void and the question on the jurisdiction of the tribunal been successful at the time, Shasore’s position “would have knocked out P&ID’s entire claim”. The former Lagos commissioner has also maintained that he defended Nigeria to the best of his ability on the matter. Meanwhile, Shasore’s interrogation by the EFCC comes months before a dispute between Nigeria and P&ID is scheduled for trial in the United Kingdom.
