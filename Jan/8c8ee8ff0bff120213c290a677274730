Troops of the Nigerian Air Force have reportedly killed some gunmen identified as leaders of a group of bandits in Zamfara. The gunmen were said to have been killed during an operation by the air force component of operation Hadarin Daji in communities across Zamfara. Some other bandits were also said to have been killed during the operation, which took place in the early hours of Saturday. When contacted, Edward Gabkwet, air force spokesperson, confirmed the raid to TheCable. He, however, said the identities of those killed have not yet been confirmed. Gabkwet also said the number of casualties has not been confirmed. “I can only confirm that yes indeed, very early today on 1 January, 2022, we undertook some strikes in Zamfara based on credible intel,” he said. “I can’t, however, confirm who was killed.”
