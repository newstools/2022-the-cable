Former President Olusegun Obasanjo has informed Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) chieftains that nothing will make him return to politics. Obasanjo made his position known while addressing Iyorchia Ayu, PDP national chairman, and other leaders of the party on Saturday. TheCable had reported that PDP chieftains, including former governors, visited the former president at his Abeokuta residence. Obasanjo was elected president twice on the platform of the PDP but in 2015, the former president distanced himself from party politics. Speaking with the PDP leaders, the former president said the party would continue to be part of his history, insisting that since he tore his membership card in 2015, he severed ties with active politics. Obasanjo said he will continue to play the role of a statesman, adding that he will offer advice to anyone who wants it in the best interest of the nation. “I’m no longer in partisan politics and there is nothing that can bring back. Anybody who wants my advice, I will always be there in the best interest of Nigeria,” he said. “Whatever I do in my own life…because I became president on the platform of PDP, PDP will continue to be part of my life. “Since the day I tore my PDP card, that was the day I ceased to be a member of PDP. That day I vowed not to be a member of any political party. “I will remain a statesman in Nigeria, West Africa, Africa and indeed in the world at large. “Though I have retired from partisan politics, but I cannot retire from the welfare and wellbeing of the people, whether in my own community, in my own state, in my own country, anywhere in Africa or indeed anywhere in the world.” On his part, Ayu told the former president that the “blood of PDP” will never leave him, even though he has left the party. The PDP national chairman said the party would always require his fatherly advice for good governance.
