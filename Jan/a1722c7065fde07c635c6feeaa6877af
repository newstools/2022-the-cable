Mai Mala Buni, chairman of the national caretaker committee of the All Progressives Congress (APC), is expected to meet with Danjuma Goje, senator representing Gombe central, and Inuwa Yahaya, Gombe governor, over the reorganisation of the party in the state. The politicians have been at loggerheads in recent months over the control of the APC in the state. The imminent restructuring is coming after a reported reconciliation of both men by Buni last week. A source privy to the talks said the governor and the senator were asked to allow peace to reign in the party in Gombe. “The party leaders appealed to both Governor Yahaya and senator Goje to allow peace to reign in line with Islamic teachings,” the source said. “The governor and the senator agreed to this. This was the second phase of the outcome of the peace meeting.” Babagana Zulum, governor of Borno, was said to have been involved in the talks. “It is expected that the reorganisation of the party structure in Gombe would be done during the meeting at Goje’s residence in Abuja,” another source said. In November 2021, Goje was attacked while en route to the state capital but the governor accused him of “unleashing mayhem” in the state.
