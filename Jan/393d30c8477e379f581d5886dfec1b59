A fire outbreak, on Wednesday, destroyed hundreds of shanties, shops and makeshift buildings at a sawmill in the Oko-Oba area of Lagos state. About 40 sawmilling machines were also destroyed in the inferno, NAN reports. The fire was said to have spread through the shanties due to the dryness of the combustible substances involved. Ibrahim Farinloye, zonal coordinator of the National Emergency Management Agency (NEMA), south-west, confirmed the incident. Farinloye said the fire began at 11:40am and was put out by the combined efforts of the Federal Fire Service, Lagos, and the Lagos State Emergency Management Agency (LASEMA). Margaret Adeseye, director of Lagos State Fire and Rescue Service, said no life was lost in the incident. On January 1, a three-storey building on Onadeko street, Lawanson, Surulere area of the state was gutted by fire. The fire was reportedly caused by faulty electrical appliances that exploded after power was restored to the building.
