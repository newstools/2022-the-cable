Sunday Dare, minister of sports, says the Super Eagles will bounce back from their disappointing round of 16 defeat to Tunisia at the ongoing Africa Cup of Nations (AFCON) in Cameroon. Nigeria’s impressive run at the tournament came to an abrupt end on Sunday after losing 1-0 to the Carthage Eagles. The team has been at the receiving end of intense criticisms, with Nigerians expressing their anger over the defeat. In a statement on Tuesday, Dare said although the loss was disappointing, the Eagles should pick up vital lessons that would make them better in the future. The sports minister also said despite not reaching its goal at the tournament, the team gave a good account of themselves. He said there is enough reason to be proud and optimistic, adding that with commitment, the team would be a force to reckon with in any competition in the future. “We had hoped with their prior superlative performances they would advance and come home with a historic victory in our hands,” he said. “We did not reach our goal as a nation but we have reason to be proud and optimistic about the future of our team. The players gave a good account of themselves and have put Africa and the rest of the world on notice. This team will improve and become a solid and fierce contender in any future competition. “Our football, once again, was fluid, purposeful and beautiful to watch as the Eagles distinguished themselves with brilliant displays leading to CAF’ technical men voting Austin Eguavoen as the best coach of the group phase. “As long as we remain committed to teamwork and a common goal, the Eagles will become more and more formidable.” Dare also appreciated President Muhammadu Buhari over his support for the team and assured Nigerians that the Super Eagles will strive to qualify for the 2022 World Cup and next year’s AFCON in Cote d’Ivoire.
