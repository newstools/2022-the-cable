The association of commercial tricycle operators in Kano state has suspended its strike. Abba Hikima, the association’s lawyer, announced the suspension of the strike on Wednesday while addressing journalists after a meeting between officials of the association and the state government. The meeting was led by the Aminu Gadanya, chairman of the state’s Nigerian Bar Association (NBA). Baffa Dan’agundi, managing director of the Kano road traffic agency (KAROTA), represented the state government while Hikima represented the association of the tricycle operators. The tricycle operators, on Monday, began a seven-day strike to protest a levy of N8,000 imposed by KAROTA for renewal of registration. The strike left commuters stranded, with many resorting to private cars, buses, taxis, motorcycles, and trucks. Hikima said, during the meeting, it was resolved that members of the association would resume work from Thursday and that the association would write to the state government to request for a reduction of the registration fee from N8,000. He also said members of the association would, however, have to pay for the registration until the reduction of the fee which would be announced at a meeting to be convened on January 18. Members of the association are also to continue paying the daily levy of N100.
