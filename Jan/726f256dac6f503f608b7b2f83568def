President Muhammadu Buhari has arrived in Abeokuta, Ogun state capital, for the inauguration of some projects executed by Dapo Abiodun, the governor. The president was received by Abiodun and other top government officials of the state around 10:40am at Mojoda area in Ijebu-Ode, where he cut the tape for the inauguration of the 14 kilometre Ijebu-Ode-Mojoda-Epe expressway. Buhari is also expected to inaugurate other projects including the Gateway City Gate Monument Park and Sagamu Interchange. Other projects to be inaugurated are two housing estates — 527-unit low-and-medium housing scheme at Kobape in Obafemi-Owode LGA and the 83-unit duplexes at Kings Court Estate, Oke-Mosan in Abeokuta. Buhari is also scheduled to hold a stakeholders’ meeting at the presidential lodge in Abeokuta to end the visit. According to NAN, Abeokuta, the state capital, is wearing a new look as major highways, bridges and other major public institutions are decorated. The Federal Road Safety Corps (FRSC) and the state traffic monitoring and control agency had closed some major roads to traffic. Alternative routes were, however, created and opened for motorists in the state while the visit lasts.
