Chelsea and Liverpool settled for a 2-2 draw in an entertaining English Premier League (EPL) fixture at Stamford Bridge on Sunday evening. Sadio Mane and Mohamed Salah were on the scoresheet as Liverpool took a commanding lead before Chelsea salvaged a point through Matteo Kovacic and Christian Pulisic strikes. While Thomas Tuchel, Chelsea coach, omitted Romelu Lukaku from the squad following the striker’s recent feisty interview, Jurgen Klopp was not in the dugout due to suspected COVID-19. Mane rounded the goalkeeper following a defensive mistake to score an early opener on nine minutes before Salah’s well-placed strike beat Edouard Mendy at his near post for his 150th EPL goal. Liverpool’s comfortable lead was, however, obliterated in four minutes with two goals coming for the Blues late in the half. Kovacic volleyed into the top corner on 42 minutes before N’Golo Kante found Pulisic behind the Anfield side’s defence to restore parity going into the break. Both sides huffed and puffed in the second half with their respective goalkeepers standing resolute when called into action as the two title hopefuls settled for a draw. Chelsea sit second on 43 points, cutting Manchester City’s lead to 10 points, while Liverpool remain third but have played a games less than the top two clubs. RESULTS
