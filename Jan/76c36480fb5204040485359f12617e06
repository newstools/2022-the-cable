The police command in Ogun says it has arrested Timothy Oluwatimilehin, the pastor-in-charge of Spirit Filled International Christian Church, Abeokuta, for “luring church members to his house for sex”. According to the police, the pastor allegedly lured the victims — a mother and her two daughters — to his house. Abimbola Oyeyemi, Ogun police spokesperson, in a statement on Thursday, said the pastor was arrested following a complaint by the husband of the church member. Oyeyemi said the pastor confessed that he took advantage of the “little misunderstanding” between the woman and her husband to commit the crime. “A pastor-in-charge of Spirit Filled International Christian Church, Olumore Abeokuta, Pastor Timothy Oluwatimilehin, has been arrested by men of Ogun State Police command for luring a housewife and her two daughters away from her husband’s house, kept them in his own house and having carnal knowledge of them all,” the statement reads. “The pastor was arrested following a complaint lodged at Adatan police station by the husband of the victim, who was accompanied by an official of the ministry of women affairs, and reported that his wife and two daughters were lured by the pastor of their church who took them into his custody and has since been having sex with both the mother and her two daughters. “On interrogation, the pastor confessed to the commission of the crime but pleaded for forgiveness. “In his confession, he explained that he took advantage of the little misunderstanding between the woman and he husband to carry out the devilish act.” Oyeyemi added that Lanre Bankole, Ogun commissioner of police, “has directed the anti human trafficking and child labour unit of the state criminal investigation and intelligence department to take over the case”. He also said the suspect will be charged to court as soon as investigation is completed.
