Seyi Makinde, governor of Oyo, says only candidates who have the “energy” to rule Nigeria should be elected come 2023. Speaking on Tuesday at the retirement thanksgiving service held in honour of Samson Ayokunle, president of the Christian Association of Nigeria (CAN), Makinde said governance is not an easy task. He advised presidential aspirants in their 70s to think twice about their decision. He urged the people of Oyo and Nigerians in general to elect only those “who have the energy to truly serve the country”. “We have seen a lot of elder statesmen who want to run this country at age 75 or 78. I want them to think twice and I am saying to the people of Oyo state and Nigeria that this world is not easy,” Makinde said. “It is possible for you to delegate, ask people to go all over the place but when they are reporting to you, if something has not been added, a few things may have been removed. “We are in election season basically and what I will say to us as a people is that we need to choose wisely and elect the people who have the energy to truly serve the country.” Bola Tinubu, a leader of the All Progressives Congress (APC), aged 69, is one of the people who has indicated his interest to contest the 2023 presidential election. Makinde had told Tinubu when the latter visited Oyo state on January 15 that Nigeria needs “only the best at this time” to govern it.
