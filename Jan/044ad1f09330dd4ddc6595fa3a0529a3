The Arewa Consultative Forum (ACF) has warned its members against endorsing aspirants interested in contesting the presidency in the next election. Audu Ogbeh, chairman of the forum and former minister of agriculture, said this on Wednesday in his opening remarks at the national executive council (NEC) meeting of the forum in Kaduna. He said the ACF is not a political party and, as such, cannot endorse any presidential aspirant. He also said the ACF plans to meet with groups in the south-east, south-west and south-south as part of efforts to promote peaceful coexistence among Nigerians ahead of the general election. “Our plans to have meetings with Afenifere, Ohanaeze, south-south people congress is still on course because there is a need to put a stop to abusive words against one region or the other,” he said. “We should desist from endorsing any candidate for the 2023 presidency. If anybody asks you about endorsement, tell such person that we are not a political party. “Even for 2023, we do not know yet who the candidate is. We are not a political party. We do not participate in political activities except where it becomes necessary. “May God help us with good candidates. It is only the almighty God that can solve our problem. “We need to make peace. Abusive words on social media will not help us. We don’t want chaos in this country. If we turn refugees, where do we go? We will abandon all our property because we cannot carry anything along with us other than Ghana-must-go bags.” The ACF chairman also expressed concern over reports of cult activities in schools and called on governments at all levels to ensure the safety of schoolchildren. “Government must try very hard to bring sanity to our school system, otherwise we are going nowhere, because there are crimes like cultism, sodomy and others in most of our schools today,” he said.
