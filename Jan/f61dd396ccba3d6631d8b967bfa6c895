Amina Mohammed says she will ensure no one is left behind as she resumes duty as the United Nations (UN) deputy secretary-general for a second term. Mohammed said this on Tuesday after her re-appointment was officially announced in a press statement by the UN on Monday. In June 2021, TheCable had reported Antonio Guterres, UN secretary-general, as saying he had extended an offer to Mohammed to continue in office after he was re-appointed as secretary-general. Responding through her social media account, Mohammed said she is “humbled” to resume the role as a “proud Nigerian woman” with renewed hope in achieving the sustainable development goals (SDGs). “I am deeply humbled to serve a second term as UN deputy secretary-general alongside Antonio Guterres,” she said. “I begin this new term as a proud Nigerian woman with renewed hope in human solidarity and determination to keep the promise of the #SDGs. We will leave no one behind.” The UN appreciated Mohammed for her show of leadership in advancing the sustainable development goals of the organisation. “The Secretary-General expressed his appreciation for the Deputy Secretary-General’s leadership of the United Nations Sustainable Development Group and her determination to reinforce collective results and maximize the impact of the United Nations development’s system on the ground,” it said.
