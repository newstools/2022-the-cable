The Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) says the allowances of 630 ad hoc staff will be withheld over failure to return materials and devices used during the Anambra governorship election. The election took place on November 6, 2021, and Chukwuma Soludo, a former governor of the Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN), was declared winner of the election. Speaking on Tuesday at a media briefing, Nkwachukwu Orji, the Anambra resident electoral commissioner (REC), said some of the materials included Bimodal Voter Accreditation System (BVAS) machines, battery chargers, and cables. “The commission has taken the unfortunate decision to withhold the allowances of staff involved in the act, pending the return of the materials to the commission,” NAN quoted him as saying. The REC added that though some of the ad hoc staff had started returning the items, the commission resolved to suspend payment of their allowances until all the materials are returned. Speaking on the continuous voter registration (CVR) in the state, Orji said the commission has lifted the suspension, adding that the exercise will take place in the commission’s headquarters in Awka and the 21 LGAs of the state. Orji urged those eligible to register to get their permanent voter cards (PVCs). He also said those who registered before September 15, 2021, could come for their PVCs at the INEC office.
