I will turn Nigeria to Dubai.– Tinubu Me: no be only Dubai na Dusell — Just Society (@JustSociety4all) January 11, 2022  I will turn Nigeria to Dubai.– Tinubu Una no fit finish rail line in 12years for Lagos. Nonsense and ingredient.. — Raymond (@IamTheIroko) January 12, 2022  I will turn Nigeria to Dubai.– TinubuMe: this is someone who could not turn Lagos to Johannesburg — Karo Gizmo Jighere (@Gizmojigs) January 11, 2022  VERIFICATION Several checks on previous statements made by Tinubu showed the former Lagos governor did not make such statement. A keyword internet search by TheCable gave no result on where or when the APC chieftain made the statement and none of the users who posted the statement indicated their source(s). In an interview with TheCable, Tunde Rahman, Tinubu’s spokesperson, said he is not aware of his principal making such a statement after declaring his intentions to the president. “I am not aware. What I know is that two days ago, he told the state correspondents that he has consulted the president and he has informed him of his ambition and he’s also going to go ahead and tell other stakeholders and very soon, when he decides fully, he would address the press conference and unfolds his agenda,” Rahman told TheCable. VERDICT There is no evidence that Tinubu made the statement about turning Nigeria to Dubai if elected president.
