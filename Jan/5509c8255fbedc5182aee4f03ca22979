The Gombe government has called for calm in the state following the shooting of a truck driver by a police inspector, identified as Urbanus Ishaku. Truck drivers in the state had, on Monday, blocked the Gombe-Dukku-Darazo road to protest the shooting of their colleague, identified as Abdullahi Bello. The protest grounded vehicular movement in the area, with many commuters left stranded. Speaking on the incident at a media briefing, Julius Ishaya, the Gombe commissioner for information, said the victim was taken to a health facility in the state where he is currently receiving treatment. Ishaya described the incident as a “misunderstanding between the policeman and the tanker driver”. The commissioner also disclosed that the officer has been arrested, adding that investigation has commenced to unravel the cause of the “misunderstanding”. “At this point, we want to appeal to the public to maintain calm as the government had taken steps by engaging all parties involved,” NAN quoted him as saying. Confirming the incident, Ishola Babaita, the Gombe commissioner of police, said the truck driver was shot during a stop-and-search operation. “Today, January 17, 2022, at about 06:30am at Gombe-Abba police nipping-point on Dukku-Darazo road, while conducting stop-and-search, inspector Urbanus Ishaku shot a trailer driver, one Abdullahi Bello ‘m’ of Bauchi state,” Babaita said. “As a result, he sustained injury on his buttocks. The victim was rushed to Federal Teaching Hospital, Gombe, where he is currently receiving treatment and he is in stable condition. “Any reckless policeman that goes outside the norms will be dealt with in accordance with the law and I assure the good people of the state that he (the policeman) will not go scot-free.”
