Senegal and Morocco were winners on the second day of the 2022 African Cup of Nations (AFCON) following narrow victories in their group C matches. Guinea and Gabon also emerged winners on a day all teams won by a lone goal Senegal waited till the dying seconds to overcome a stubborn Zimbabwe, thanks to Sadio Mane’s penalty. The Terranga Lions were missing key players including Kalidou Koulibaly and Edouard Mendy due to COVID-19 but managed to see off their opponents in a game that was low on chances. The 2019 AFCON finalists twice failed to find the net from point-blank range before the spot-kick was awarded when a defender’s outstretched hand blocked a shot. Mane, denied earlier in the game by the goalkeeper, blasted the penalty beyond the goalkeeper seven minutes into stoppage time to secure the win. Morocco also won the battle of potential contenders, overcoming Ghana by a lone goal. Sofiane Boufal was the hero of the encounter as he gathered a loose ball before finding the corner of the net for a 1-0 win. In other matches, Guinea also sneaked a 1-0 victory over Malawi, thanks to a string of excellent saves from Aly Keita, their goalkeeper. Issiaga Sylla, the marauding left-back, slotted in the winning goal during one of his over-lapping runs into the attack. Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang’s enforced absence for Gabon did not deter the West Africans from collecting maximum points, as Aaron Boupendza’s thunderous shot on 16 minutes proved the match-winner for Les Brésiliens against Comoros, AFCON debutants.
