The wife of Silas Vem, deputy chief of staff to Sonny Tyoden, deputy governor of Plateau state, has been reportedly abducted by gunmen. She was reportedly kidnapped on Sunday near her residence in Jos, the state capital. Ubah Ogaba, police public relations officer in the state, confirmed the development to TheCable on Tuesday and said efforts are underway to rescue the victim unharmed. “Yes, she was abducted two days ago,” the police spokesperson said. “We are on it, trying to make sure we arrest the perpetrators and also to rescue the victim.” In a related development, one Samuel Audu, a director at the ministry of health in Plateau, is also said to have been abducted. Audu was reportedly kidnapped on Monday on his way home from work in Barkin Ladi LGA of the state. The police spokesperson said the command has not confirmed Audu’s kidnapping, but promised to provide an update on the case. In recent months, gunmen have been targeting towns, killing locals, and kidnapping several people in the north-central state.
