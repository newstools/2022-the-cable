Garuda Indonesia Flight 200 emergency landing. This can only be God.” The video garnered 337 views and 25 shares. DID AN INDONESIAN PLANE CRASH LAND? An online check by TheCable showed the misleading video was shared online in 2021 and has been been fact-checked by AFP. The platform found out that the video was actually created by a YouTube user with computer-generated imagery, while it added that it is not a real incident. TheCable also noted that the two videos were merged using editing tools. The second part of the video was a Caspian Airlines flight which veered off the runway in Iran’s Isfahan during landing after one of the aircraft’s gears collapsed on touchdown. The incident was said to have happened on January 6. According to Avherald, a website that publishes aviation incidents, 5 of the 110 passengers were slightly injured when they were forced to evacuate with emergency slides. A Caspian Airlines plane made an emergency landing on a highway between Isfahan and Tehran on Wednesday while on its way to the Iranian capital from Iraq’s Najaf city. #Iraq #Iran #airlines pic.twitter.com/QISyofFT7r — Sinan S.
