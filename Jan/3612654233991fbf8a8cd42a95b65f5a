Antonio Guterres, UN secretary-general, says the goal to achieve 1.5 degrees celsius is not improving but rather retrogressing. Guterres said this through his social media handle on Friday. TheCable had reported how at COP26, countries agreed to phase out coal, only to discover at the last minute that there had been a compromise on the language of coal from “phase out” to “phase down” because of India and China. The UN chief who had always advocated for countries to end the use of coal by 2030 said coalitions need to be set up in order to “phase out” coal — which is the dirtiest and most polluting fossil fuel. “The 1.5°C global heating goal is receding, not getting closer,” he said. “We must accelerate the energy transition in emerging economies—particularly those dependent on coal. “That’s why I’m calling for targeted coal phase-out coalitions & a just transition from fossil fuels.”
