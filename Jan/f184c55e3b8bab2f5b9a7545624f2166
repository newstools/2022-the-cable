The Borno government says it will set up a committee of enquiry to investigate the attack on Jubril Sadi Mato, a JSS1 student of El-Kanemi College of Islamic Theology in Maiduguri. TheCable had reported that Ahmed Umar Goni, an SS2 student of the school, allegedly used a razor blade to slit the neck of Jubril over the latter’s refusal to run errands. The incident left the victim unconscious and he was rushed to the intensive care unit (ICU) of the University of Maiduguri Teaching Hospital (UMTH). TheCable understands that the senior student has been arrested and handed over to the police. A family member, who spoke on the condition of anonymity to TheCable, alleged that the school management tried to cover up the incident by saying Jubril got injured after a fall. Speaking on Friday, Lawan Abba Wakilbe, Borno commissioner of education, described the incident as “unfortunate”, while confirming that Goni is currently in police custody. “The news of this unfortunate incident reached me while we were in southern Borno trying to conduct a competency test for all LEA teachers in the southern Borno senatorial district,” the commissioner said. “With the full compliments of the ministry of education and SUBEB. I have dispatched my ministerial secretary to go back urgently and a committee of enquiry will be formed right away and we shall brief the press accordingly. “But one thing I will tell you is that the culprit is in police custody and his identity is known, and further details will be given to you people as soon as the committee of enquiry finishes its investigation.”
