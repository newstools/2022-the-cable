Austin Akobundu, former national secretary of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP), says dialogue will ease tension in the south-eastern part of the country. In a statement issued on Monday, Akobundu said people of the region are not violent but peace-loving. The agitation by the Indigenous People of Biafra (IPOB) to secede has resulted in violence and killings in the south-east — although the separatist group has continued to deny its involvement. The PDP chieftain said all the leaders in the region should put aside their differences and unite to seek lasting solutions to the problems of the south-east. “I earnestly call on the federal government to immediately ease the tension in the Southeast by heeding to demands for political solution and dialogue to address the issues agitating the people,” he said. “South-easterners are not violent but peace-loving and very hardworking people who are mostly misunderstood. “Moreover, the time has come for leaders of the south-east to put aside all personal interests and come together once more to find lasting solutions to the economic, political and social challenges facing our region. “The south-east is blessed with abundant natural, and most importantly, a highly ingenious, inventive, hardworking and resilient human capital resources that when fully developed and harnessed, will guarantee the desired economic revolution in the region.”
