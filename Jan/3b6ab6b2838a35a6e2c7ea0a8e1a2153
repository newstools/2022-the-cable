Ahmed Musa, controller of the Nigerian Correctional Service (NCoS), FCT command, has teamed up with heads of the Nigeria Security and Civil Defence Corps (NSCDC) and the Nigerian Immigration Service (NIS), to beef up security around custodial centres in the federal capital territory (FCT). Chukwuedo Humphrey, spokesman of the correctional service, FCT command, said this in a statement on Thursday. According to the statement, the agreement to collaborate was done at a meeting of heads of security agencies convened by Musa at his FCT command headquarters office in Gwagwalada, Abuja on Tuesday. The statement said this follows the directive given by Rauf Aregbesola, minister of interior, for the use of maximum force in the protection of the custodial centre. “The FCT Command correctional Service boss pointed out that while attacks on any government infrastructure is an abberation, it will be a great misnomer if the attacks get close to the custodial centres in the FCT, hence the need for the improvement of the joint security team guarding the custodial centres in Abuja,” the statement reads. “The heads of the security agencies all unanimously agreed to pool their best team of personnel to the different custodial centres to ensure that the security of the centres are not jeopardised. “They jointly called on the residents of FCT to go about their lawful businesses without fear and to report anyone found perpetuating any acts that could be inimical to the peace of the community to the nearest security agency.” There has been a series of jailbreaks at different custodial centres across the country in recent months, which has led to the loss of lives and the escape of thousands of inmates. The most recent attack occurred in November when gunmen invaded the Jos correctional centre. In December, the correctional service had said it plans to set up a special security team to strengthen the security around custodial centres across the country.
