Nnamdi Kanu, leader of the Indigenous People of Biafra (IPOB), has engaged the services of Mike Ozekhome, a senior advocate of Nigeria (SAN). Ozekhome arrived at the federal high court on Tuesday in company of Ifeanyi Ejiofor who was previously leading the team of lawyers for Kanu. Ejiofor confirmed this to journalists at the court premises on Tuesday. Ozekhome who also confirmed this said: “Yes, I’m now in the legal team and that’s why you’re seeing me in court.” Security at the court and its surroundings has been beefed up. Roads leading to the court have been blocked by operatives of the Department of the State Services (DSS) to ward off possible threats to life and businesses by hoodlums. Kanu, who is standing trial on charges bordering on treasonable felony, has arrived at the court to continue his trial. On Monday, the federal government filed eight fresh charges bordering on terrorism against the IPOB leader. Kanu, who was re-arraigned in October 2021 on a seven-count charge, will now take his plea in response to a charge on 15 counts, including on terrorism. As of the time of this report, Kanu has entered the courtroom and is exchanging pleasantries with his lawyers and family. The judge is yet to enter the courtroom.
