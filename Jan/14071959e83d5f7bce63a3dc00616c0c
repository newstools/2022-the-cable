Victor Osimhen has slammed a critic who accused him of “deliberately colluding with Napoli” to miss the ongoing AFCON in Cameroon. Osimhen, who was the Super Eagles’ highest goal scorer during the qualification campaign, pulled out of the competition after initially declaring himself fit to represent Nigeria at the continental tourney. The 22-year-old was included in the initial 28-man squad released by Austin Eguavoen. Osimhen, however, tested positive for COVID-19 a few days to AFCON before he eventually demanded to be excused from the team so he “could fully recover from the injury” he picked up while playing Napoli last year. Since he will be absent to help the team as they prepare to take on Egypt in their group opener on Tuesday, the striker took to his Twitter page to wish the Eagles good luck ahead of the game. “Good luck to the Super Eagles as they begin their AFCON campaign tomorrow against Egypt. Team Nigeria, let’s go!!! Super Eagles,” he wrote. A Twitter user had, however, jumped on the comment section of the tweet to call the footballer out while accusing him of deliberately missing AFCON to satisfy his club. “B**tard. Come to AFCON you and Napoli run us street abii…No yawa,” the Twitter user wrote with doses of pidgin English. Osimhen fired back with a sarcastic response that directed the derogatory term to the user’s father. “Make I just pretend say na your papa you call b**tard so,” the 22-year-old wrote. Super Eagles will be playing Egypt at the Roumdé Adjia stadium in Garoua at 5 pm on Tuesday. The winner of the clash has been predicted to finish top of Group D which also has Guinea Bissau and Sudan.
