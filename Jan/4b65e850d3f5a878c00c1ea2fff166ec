A high court in Umuahia, Abia state, has ordered the federal government to pay N1 billion to Nnamdi Kanu, leader of the Indigenous People of Biafra (IPOB), for violating his rights. Kanu, who is in DSS custody, filed the suit through his counsel, Aloy Ejimakor against Abubakar Malami, attorney-general of the federation (AGF), and the Department of State Services (DSS) for allegedly violating his fundamental human rights. Aside from the AGF and the DSS director-general, other respondents include the federal government of Nigeria (first), chief of army staff (third), inspector-general of police (fifth), and three others. Amongst other reliefs sought in the suit marked HIH/FR14/2021, Kanu asked the court to compel the respondents to pay him N5 billion in damages as monetary compensation for the “physical, mental, emotional, psychological and other damages” suffered as a result of the alleged infringement on his fundamental rights. He also sought damages for the invasion of his father’s house on September 10, 2017, by the military. Delivering judgment on Wednesday, Benson Anya, the judge, described the invasion of Kanu’s Afaraukwu residence as notorious and brazen. The judge also ordered the federal government to issue a public apology to Kanu in three national dailies. He also advised the federal government to adopt a political resolution in dealing with issues involving Kanu. However, the judge struck out other reliefs sought by Kanu’s legal team, including an order against his continued detention by the DSS.
