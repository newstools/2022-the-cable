Dapo Abiodun, governor of Ogun, says President Muhammadu Buhari will “guide” the All Progressives Congress (APC) on zoning its tickets and national offices. Though the ruling party has fixed February 26 for its elective convention, it is yet to zone its national offices to any region or geo-political zone. Speaking with journalists on Friday after a meeting with Buhari and party leaders from Ogun, Abiodun said the APC is currently working on a “zoning formula”, which would be approved by the national executive committee (NEC). “I will be hesitant to delve into the details of this question because, one, I’m not in any position or capacity to advise the party,” the governor said after he was asked if he had offered counsel to the APC on zoning. “I am a governor. I am a member of the party and I will continue to be guided by the party leadership and in line with party discipline. “We have a president in place. We are the party that is in government. Our president is the leader of the party. The president will continue to offer us the guidance that is required and [we] will do what we need to do under his leadership. “I am not sure that I am capable, or have the capacity, to begin to advise the party when I am just a member of the party and a governor, and the party has a leader who is the president. “We are aware that the party is working on zoning and when that is formalised and ratified by NEC, then it will be made public so we’ll know where the chairman of the party will come from. We’ll know where the president will come from and things will evolve in their own time.” Abiodun added that he led the delegation to Buhari to thank him for his recent visit to Ogun, where he inaugurated some projects.
