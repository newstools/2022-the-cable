Sunday Dare, minister of sports, has commended the Nigerian high commission in Cameroon over its support for the Super Eagles at the ongoing Africa Cup of Nations (AFCON). TheCable understands that Gabriel Abayomi Olonisakin, Nigerian ambassador to Cameroon, and other officials of the high commission in the country, held a warm reception for the Super Eagles when the team arrived Garoua for the tournament. The commission has also continued to mobilise the Nigerian community to attend the matches in support of the Super Eagles. In a statement on Monday, Dare lauded the Nigerian envoy and his officials for giving the Eagles the right atmosphere to thrive in the competition. “The federal ministry of youth and sports development, the Nigeria Football Federation and even the Super Eagles are really appreciative of what the Nigerian high commission is doing. Garoua has become home away from home for us all,” he said. “Driving through Garoua, you will get the feeling that you are in a Nigerian town. One of every three persons on the street is putting on a Nigerian jersey and the Nigerian flag is everywhere. This is really heartwarming and inspiring.” The Eagles will play their final Group D game on Wednesday against Guinea Bissau in Garoua, after securing victories over Egypt and Sudan to qualify for the knockout stages.
