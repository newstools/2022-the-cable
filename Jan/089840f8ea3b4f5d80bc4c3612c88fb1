The Parliamentary Staff Association of Nigeria (PASAN) has asked its members to commence strike on Monday. According to a communique issued on Thursday and signed by Sunday Sabiyi, chairman of PASAN at the national assembly, and M.A. Liman, vice-chairman of the national assembly service commission (NASC), the directive was issued after a joint congress in Abuja. The association accused the management of the national assembly of a “breach of the Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) entered with PASAN on April 13, 2021 on the full implementation of the new national minimum wage Act 2019 and the revised condition of service”. “In view of the resolutions, congress resolves to embark on industrial action, commencing with mass picketing from Monday, January 10, 2022 in protest of the breach of the MoU,” the communique reads. “In view of the contraventions above, the NASC/NASS joint emergency congress resolves as follows: That management should pay with immediate effect five months outstanding balance of minimum wage, year 2021 rent subsidy, 15 months arrears of Conpeculiar allowances, six months arrears of hazard allowance to National Assembly staff. “In addition to the MoU, congress also demands the implementation of 50 percent balance of Conless, immediate release of the year 2022 training template for staff and evidence of provision of gratuity for retiring staff. “Whereas management had earlier identified the supplementary budget 2021 as one amongst various sources of funding the MoU, congress is amazed that suddenly, the supplementary budget and virement of the 2021 fiscal appropriation have become the source of funding items not captured in the MoU including end of year bonus and promotion  arrears.”
