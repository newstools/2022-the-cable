The Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) says it received over five million applications on the online portal for the continuous voter registration (CVR) exercise. In June, the commission launched a portal where Nigerians can register or request to update their voter information before they complete the process physically at designated centres. According to data released by the commission on Monday, the number of new registrants has risen to 5,027,204. The data shows that Delta state is in the lead with 372,597 registrations, followed by Bayelsa with 309,385 and Edo with 244,027 registrations. The electoral body gave the number of those who had completed their online and physical registration as 2,563,068. It said out of this number, 1,292,823 are male, while 1,270,245 are female. INEC said youths — between 18 and 35 — constitute the highest number of completed registrations with a number of 1,783,313. INEC had said both the online pre-registration and physical registration will subsist simultaneously until the CVR exercise is suspended on June 30, 2022. The voter registration exercise has, however, been suspended in the federal capital territory (FCT), in view of the area council election coming up on February 12.
