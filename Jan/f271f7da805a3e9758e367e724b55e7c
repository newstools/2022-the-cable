Cameroon, hosts of the ongoing African Cup of Nations (AFCON), defeated ten-man Comoros 2-1 in their round of 16 encounter at the Olembe stadium on Monday night. Cameroon scored once in each half — through Karl Toko Ekambi and Vincent Aboubakar — to overcome a stubborn Comoros side that had to field a player as its goalkeeper following a COVID-19 crisis in the team. The Islanders played over 80 minutes of the match with a man down and came close to forcing an extra time with an 81st-minute free kick through Youssouf M’changama. Nadjim Abdou, Comoros captain, was sent off barely six minutes into the game. Ekambi, the Villarreal striker, scored the opening goal on 29 minutes after being set up by Aboubakar as Cameroon struggled to dominate the game. Aboubaker then doubled the Indomitable Lions’ advantage with an easy tap-in at the near post following a through pass. Comoros were relentless as they reduced the deficit from a long range free kick. Stand-in keeper Chaker Alhadhur also made a number of saves during the thrilling encounter. The Les Coelecantes however could not repeat the trick and crashed out of their maiden AFCON appearance. Cameroon will face Gambia, the giant killers who eliminated Guinea 1-0 earlier in the day, in the quarter-finals on Saturday.
