Iyorchia Ayu, national chairman of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP), has tackled President Muhammadu Buhari over his comment on state police. While speaking in an interview on Channels Television aired on Wednesday, Buhari said state police is not a better option in tackling insecurity in the country. “State police is not an option. Find out the relationship between local governments and the governors. Are the third tier of government getting what they are supposed to get constitutionally,” Buhari had said. But reacting in a statement, Ayu said Buhari’s rejection of state police shows the “continued killings” in the country does not bother him. “Watching President Muhammadu Buhari this evening on Channels TV during an interview session was a gratuitous waste of time because there was nothing new coming from the President,” Ayu said. “As has been said by many before now, to expect anything new from our President would be a misplaced and unfortunate expectation. From the economy to insecurity, killing of innocent farmers by terrorists (which some erroneously term farmer/herder clashes) and other sundry issues, President Buhari honoured his calling as a President who has nothing new to offer. “In President Buhari’s view, State Police is not an option. Yet, it appears the continued killings in some localities of Nigeria, particularly in the North, and more specifically in his home state of Katsina, may not matter, hence, the need to have a security system that feeds on local intelligence and nuances, which the federal police cannot adequately provide, is not an option to our President. “To him, it appears that continuing the same process while expecting a different output and outcome is the best way to go. We ask, is he comfortable with the killings in the land while the status quo persists? Ayu said Buhari should be reminded that societies evolve and Nigerians will not accept his rejection of state police.
