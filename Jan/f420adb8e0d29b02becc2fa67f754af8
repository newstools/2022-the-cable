Speaking with TheCable at the Africa Cup of Nations (AFCON) in Cameroon, Awoniyi explained why he decided to join Union Berlin, the German Bundesliga side. Liverpool sold Awoniyi to Union Berlin last summer in a £6.5 million deal — and the 24-year-old has netted nine goals for the club so far. Speaking of his decision to pitch his tent with Union Berlin, he said: “For me, it was a time where I needed a permanent stay rather than loan. “In life, people will always talk but football is more than what the viewer watches, but Liverpool know their reason. I just know I was not interested in loan anymore at that time.” Awoniyi said contrary to public opinion that loan spells hurt his international career, they actually helped him become a better player. He said: “I will always say it’s football and it’s beyond just talking and viewing. Those loans they are condemning made me who I am today. So, you see, it is already two sides to the story, what they see and what I know.” The 2013 U-17 FIFA World Cup winner said it was an honour to have played against Mohamed Salah when Nigeria faced Egypt at the AFCON Group D opener. Commenting on his supplication-like goal celebration, Awoniyi described it as “a way of showing how grateful I am to God”.
