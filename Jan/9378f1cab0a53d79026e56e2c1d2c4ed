Otokito Federal Oparmiola, the Bayelsa state commissioner of trade and commerce, has been abducted by gunmen. The commissioner was reportedly kidnapped on Thursday night at his residence in Otuokpoti, Ogbia LGA of the state. The armed gunmen were said to have invaded the neighbourhood, shooting randomly into the air to frighten the locals before whisking the commissioner away. Asinim Butswat, police public relations officer in Bayelsa, confirmed the development to TheCable on Friday. The police spokesperson said efforts are underway to rescue the victim. “Investigation is ongoing,” he said. “We have launched a manhunt for his rescue and arrest of the perpetrators.” Otokito is the second commissioner to be abducted in the last six months. Sani Idris, the Niger commissioner of information, was abducted by bandits in August 2021. He regained his freedom and reunited with his family a few days after the incident.
