Pope Francis has condemned violence against women, describing it as an “insult to God”. He said this on Saturday in his first series of tweets for the new year. He spoke on the unique qualities of women, and prayed that the new year will be a year of growth, rebirth and transformation. “The New Year begins under the sign of the mother. A mother’s gaze is the path to rebirth and growth,” he wrote. “Mothers know how to overcome obstacles and conflicts. They know how to instill peace. Thus they succeed in transforming problems into opportunities for rebirth and growth. “Let us all make greater efforts to promote mothers and to protect women. How much violence is directed against women!  Enough!  To hurt a woman is to insult God, who took on our humanity. “As we begin the New Year, we place ourselves under the protection of the #MotherOfGod, who is also our mother. May she help us to keep and ponder all things, unafraid of trials, in the joyful certainty that the Lord is faithful and knows how to change crosses into resurrections.”
