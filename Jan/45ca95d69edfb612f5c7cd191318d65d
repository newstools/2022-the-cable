The Lagos government says the consistent decrease in COVID-19 cases indicates the end of the pandemic’s fourth wave in the state. In December, Babajide Sanwo-Olu, the governor, announced that the state was experiencing a fourth wave of the COVID pandemic. Sanwo-Olu had blamed the fourth wave on the refusal of residents to adhere to the safety protocol. Giving a situation update via Twitter on Saturday, Akin Abayomi, the state commissioner for health, said there is a reduction in positivity rates — from 29.3 percent recorded on December 21, 2021, to 1.9 percent as of January 20, 2022. He said bed capacity utilisation now stands at two percent, and the fatality rate stands at 0.71 percent. The commissioner said 46 new infections were recently confirmed, increasing the number of COVID-19 infections in the state to 98,284. He added that 1,023, 203 sample tests had been conducted since the inception of the pandemic in the state. Abayomi advised residents to get vaccinated and continue to adhere to non-pharmaceutical interventions to further reduce the spread of the virus.
