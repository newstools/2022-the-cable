Goods worth millions of naira have been destroyed in an inferno that razed shops at the new Lafia Motor Park in Nasarawa state. According to NAN, the fire started on Friday night and lasted till the early hours of Saturday. Speaking on the incident, Hanatu George, coordinator of the state fire service, said firefighters responded to a distress call that came in on Friday night. George said the fire had been put out and that no life was lost. She said an investigation had begun to ascertain the cause of the fire. Ejike Igwe, a spare parts seller, said his entire shop was razed by the inferno. Igwe, who said he could not quantify the number of goods he lost to the fire, appealed for assistance from Nigerians. Earlier in the month, hundreds of shanties, shops and makeshift buildings at a sawmill in the Oko-Oba area of Lagos state were destroyed in an inferno. Three days later, 300 shops were destroyed in another fire outbreak at Nguru market in Yobe state. The fire, which started in the morning, was reportedly triggered by high electric voltage.
