Anas Anka, managing director of Thunder Blowers Media, an online media platform in Gusau, Zamfara state, says his outfit was attacked by political thugs. The attack is said to have occurred on Monday night. Speaking at a media briefing in Gusau, Anka alleged that the attack on the property was led by one Zairu Abdullahi. The managing director said computers and cameras were smashed in the process, adding that Abdullahi was the one who allegedly led a recent attack on the Nigeria Union of Journalists (NUJ) centre in the state. “We called for this important press conference to brief you on the circumstance of the attack on our head office in Gusau, Zamfara state, by some suspected political thugs and its resultant effects,” he said. “One Zairu Abdullahi led a team of nine other thugs to attack our newsroom and abduct one of our editors, Mansur Rabiu, as a result of the attack. They crashed all our eight desktop computers, cameras and our server decoders. “The suspect is the one that led the burning of the NUJ centre. We are calling on the international community to this sad development.. “We have forwarded our petition to the state commissioner and the state director of SSS. We believe they are going to take appropriate actions.”
