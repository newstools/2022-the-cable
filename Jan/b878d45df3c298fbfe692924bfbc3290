A federal high court in Abuja has adjourned the case of Nnamdi Kanu, leader of the Indigenous People of Biafra (IPOB), till Wednesday. The court had on November 2, fixed January 18 to take Kanu’s applications challenging the competence of the charge and jurisdiction of the court. However, the federal government on Monday filed a fresh charge bordering on terrorism against Kanu. The IPOB leader, who was rearraigned in October 2021 on a seven-count charge, will now take his plea in response to a charge on 15 counts bordering on terrorism. At the commencement of the court session on Tuesday, Mike Ozekhome, who has just taken over as Kanu’s lead counsel, objected to his client taking a plea on the amended charge. The senior advocate of Nigeria (SAN) said the charges were filed late and that he has not had the time to converse with his client. He, therefore, asked the court for an adjournment to enable him to meet and strategise with Kanu. “My lord, the business of today has to do with three subsisting applications; one, application for transfer, two, a motion for bail of the defendant, and three; a preliminary objection raised to the earlier charge,” he said. “Now, this amended charge was served on me yesterday, the client was here since 7 am. “With all respect, that is not justice; that is ambushing. “This is the sixth amendment they are doing, and each time, they serve us the day before the hearing so as to frustrate the proceedings. “The defendant is being told to plead to a charge he has not seen. “It is not possible for the defendant to take the plea. “They are the accusers and then they are amending a day before the trial. “My lord, can we come back tomorrow so we can speak with him about the charge.” Shuaibu Labaran, counsel to the federal government, did not object to the application for an adjournment. Binta Nyako, the judge, adjourned till Wednesday for the defendant to take his plea.
