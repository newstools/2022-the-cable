Several residents on Sunday took to the streets of Dong village in Jos North LGA of Plateau state to protest the killing of four mine workers by suspected gunmen. According to PUNCH, the agitated crowd, brandishing tree branches, blocked off the road while demanding justice for those killed. John Emmanuel, a resident of the community, was quoted as saying the youths banded together to demand justice over the “incessant killings in their community”. “Yesterday, some gunmen suspected to be herdsmen stormed Dong community in Jos South LGA. They went to a mining site where some people were working in the community and attacked them, killing four persons and injuring two others,” he said. “So, this morning, the residents, mainly the Youths in the community, came out to protest against the incessant killings in their community and demanded justice because there had been a series of such attacks and killings in the community in the past with nothing done to stop further incidents.” On his part, Gabriel Ubah, spokesman of Plateau police command, said the command was aware of the killings.
