Rochas Okorocha, senator representing Imo west, has declared his intention to run for president in the 2023 general election. Okorocha’s intention was stated in a letter read by Senate President Ahmad Lawan on the floor of the upper legislative chamber on Wednesday. The former governor of Imo state said he would formally declare his intention at a world press conference in Abuja on January 31. Okorocha first made an attempt at the presidency about 20 years ago on the platform of the now defunct All Nigerians Peoples Party (ANPP). In 2007, he aspired to clinch the ticket of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) but lost to the late former President Umaru Yar’Adua Okorocha has joined the growing list of presidential aspirants in the All Progressives Congress (APC). Bola Tinubu, former governor of Lagos, and David Umahi, Ebonyi governor, have declared their intention to run for the highest office in the land. Orji Uzor Kalu, senate whip, said he would run if the APC zoned the ticket to the south-east.
