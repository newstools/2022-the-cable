The National Working Committee (NWC) of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) has nominated Udom Emmanuel, governor of Akwa Ibom, as chairman of the Ekiti state primary election committee. In a statement on Tuesday, Umar Bature, the national organising secretary of the party, said the committee is to “conduct a special congress” for the governorship election in Ekiti. Bature said the committee “is mandated” to elect a governorship candidate for the upcoming election. He said the PDP is well prepared for the governorship election. According to Bature, the NWC also approved the nomination of Toby Okechukwu as secretary and Olusola Obada, Michael Mku and Ibrahim Khalid as members. He added that the congress is scheduled for January 26 in Ado Ekiti, the state capital. The development comes weeks after the PDP named Emmanuel as chairman of the party’s five-member electoral committee to conduct its ward congresses in Ekiti. The Ekiti governorship election is scheduled for June 18. At the last count, 17 contenders have expressed interest in being the PDP’s candidate in the election.
