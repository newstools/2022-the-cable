Femi Gbajabiamila, speaker of the house of representatives, says the country has a “poor” education system. Gbajabiamila spoke on Monday while inaugurating some projects at Igbobi College, Yaba, Lagos state. The speaker said the country’s educational system is nothing much to speak about, adding that all hands must be on deck to remedy the situation. “The education system is poor in Nigeria. It is something I talk about anywhere I get the opportunity,” he said. “Just some weeks ago, I gave a convocation lecture at the University of Lagos, and I addressed this issue. For some of us who are in the position to change things, we are working hard, working very hard to change the system. “But we need everyone, all stakeholders, to change things. Also, teachers and students need to change their attitude to education to have a better sector.” The speaker, who is a graduate of Igbobi College, also spoke on the importance of education in achieving success in life. “Education is the foundation of everything you do in life. If you are a footballer or a singer or any other person with a special talent, you still need an education,” he said. “The fact is that those things you get, like money and fame, as a special talent are ephemeral. For example, by 30 or 40, you are no more very active as a footballer, so you have to fall back on what you have in your brain, which is education, to move on in life. Education is not just rewarding but very rewarding.”
