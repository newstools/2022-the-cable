Shina Peller, a member of the house of representatives, says election rigging will be impossible in Nigeria if technology is used in the right way. Speaking on Friday at an event to mark the second anniversary of Lead Generation Initiative (LGI), Peller said technology and increased youth participation in the electoral process would make a great impact on the 2023 polls. The lawmaker said the youths must be able to identify who they want as leaders. “If we use our technology right, nobody will be able to rig elections,” said Peller who is the founder of LGI. “We are talking about youth and technology and that is what we need in 2023. The young people must be able to identify who they want as leaders. “The youth must take responsibility to build the kind of leaders they want — they have all it takes to make a change in 2023. Having your PVCs is not enough, you must participate. “Some say APC is bad, PDP is bad, but there is no time for a new party. Our long term plan is to make an impact on the 2023 [elections] and we need unity.” On her part, Ibijoke Faborode, chairperson of ElectHER, said the #EndSARS movement mobilisation should be replicated during the 2023 polls. “We organised, we mobilised, most of the funds that came in were from the diaspora,” Faborode said. “That is something we need to take into 2023. We should use technology to make the election credible.” Also speaking, Ayobola Peller, LGI executive director, said with the 2023 general election in view, the conversation about Nigeria’s future is important. “That is why we have invited notable speakers here who are experts on the theme and who we know will contribute richly to the conversation here today,” she said.
