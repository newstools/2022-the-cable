Vice-President Yemi Osinbajo has spoken of the generosity of the late Adebayo Alao-Akala, former governor of Oyo state. Osinbajo said Alao-Akala always gave him pocket money when he was in need of financial assistance, long before he became a professor. He spoke on Sunday during a condolence visit to the family of Alao-Akala who died on January 12, 2022, in Ogbomoso. Osinbajo said: “Long before I became a professor of law, I have known our dear uncle Adebayo Alao-Akala, anytime I think about him I smile because he was a very special being. “Professor Oyelowo Oyewo was my link to him, everybody knew he was his nephew. So, then, if we needed a little pocket money, we find a way of getting to our dear uncle Alao-Akala even long before he became governor of Oyo state. “He was among the top few people I first contacted when I was nominated as the vice-presidential candidate of the All Progressives Congress (APC) in 2015 and he offered his advice. “Alao-Akala was exceedingly generous. His death was touching. I pray for you the children, wives and close relatives. You will be greater than he was, and all his aspirations for you will be fulfilled.” The vice-president described Alao-Akala as a man who lived an exemplary life and that he will be remembered for the role he played in the lives of many people in Oyo state.
