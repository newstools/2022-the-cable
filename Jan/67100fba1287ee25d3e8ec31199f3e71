Akinwumi Ambode, former governor of Lagos, joined other prominent persons on Sunday for the commissioning of the turf wicket of the Tafawa Balewa Square (TBS) Cricket Oval in the state. The development comes about 18 months after the facility was shut to facilitate its upgrade from concrete bowling strips to grass. Speaking at the event, Ambode said cricket is crucial to the socio-economic development of nations if its potentials are properly harnessed. He added that the upgrade of the facility would further boost efforts to develop cricket in Nigeria. “I think critical to success in any endeavor in life are the soft skills that cricket teaches and we are very happy at the recent uptick in cricket development in Nigeria,” he said. “This turf wicket compliments all the efforts of the administration in growing the sport and I believe we would in no time feel its impact.” On his part, Osato Giwa-Osagie challenged cricketers and stakeholders to pull resources together to promote the growth of the sport. “This ground holds a lot of memories and mean much to the history of Nigeria and cricket and I am glad at the development it has undergone,” he said. Also speaking, Uyi Akpata, president of Nigeria Cricket Federation (NCF), said the revamped facility would increase the number of top flight cricket grounds in the country to seven in just one year. “Facility upgrade scores very high on our agenda and the TBS oval is very critical in that sphere as it is Nigeria’s frontline facility,” he said. Highlights of the event include two commemorative games played to mark the occasion. The first game was between selected present and past national team players and the elite cricketers in the country. The second game involved cricket veterans over the age of 50 and it featured several invited cricket stakeholders and ex-internationals across Nigeria.
