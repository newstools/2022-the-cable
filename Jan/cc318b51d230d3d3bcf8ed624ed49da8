Many shops were razed in a fire outbreak at Ogbe-Ijoh main market in Warri south LGA of Delta state on Sunday. Property and goods worth millions of naira were said to have been destroyed in the inferno which started at about 2pm. “I don’t know the cause of the fire. I was selling my tomatoes here when I saw flame coming out from inside the market and people started rushing to the scene,” a witness told NAN. One of the victims said she lost goods worth over N5 million in the fire. The victim, who spoke on the condition of anonymity, said she recently borrowed a huge amount of money from a microfinance bank to buy goods. “Where will I start from? How will I repay my debt? Government, please help me, I am dying,” she said. According to NAN, sympathisers and some of the traders in the market attempted to put out the fire and salvage some goods. Cyril Kokarhaye, secretary of Warri-south LGA Red Cross division, said: “We are yet to record any casualty and cannot ascertain the extent of the damage. “Our water truck has gone back again to refill.”
