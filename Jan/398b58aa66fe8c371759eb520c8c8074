The Lagos chapter of the National Association of Nigeria Nurses and Midwives (NANNM) says it will commence a three-day warning strike from January 10. According  to a statement issued on Friday by Oloruntoba Odumosu, the state secretary of the union, the strike exempts nurses working in federal health institutions in the state. Odumosu said the strike was necessary to compel the Lagos government to act promptly on its demands on improving working conditions. “The State Executive Council of the association at its meeting on December 29, 2021, resolved that the Council should embark on a three-day warning strike starting 08:00 am on Monday 10th January 2022 to 08:00 pm on Wednesday 12th January 2022,” the statement reads “This warning strike is to compel the Lagos State Government to act promptly on the following issues; acute shortage of nurses and midwives in health facilities; payment of retention allowance; proper consolidation of the CONHESS salary structure; regularisation of graduate nurses and stagnated nurses; improved welfare and working condition of nurses; improved hazard allowance; nurses representation in relevant boards and policymaking and life insurance scheme for nurses and other health workers.”
