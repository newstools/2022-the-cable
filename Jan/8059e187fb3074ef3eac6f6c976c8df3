Watford, English Premier League (EPL) club, have sacked Claudio Ranieri as its manager. The relegation-threatened EPL side announced the sack of the Italian coach in a statement on Monday — after a recent 3-0 loss at home to Norwich. “Watford Football Club confirms the departure of Head Coach Claudio Ranieri,” the statement read. “The Hornets’ Board recognises Claudio as a man of great integrity and honour, who will always be respected here at Vicarage Road for his efforts in leading the team with dignity. “However the Board feels that, with nearly half of the Premier League campaign remaining, a change in the Head Coach position now will give a new appointment sufficient time to work with a talented squad to achieve the immediate goal of retaining Premier League status.” The sacking leaves Emmanuel Dennis and William Troost-Ekong, Super Eagles of Nigeria players, without a manager as the Hornets continue to fight for survival. The Italian coach lasted only three months at Watford. He is also the eighth EPL manager to be sacked this season. Ranieri, an EPL title winner with Leicester City, claimed only seven points in his 14 matches with Watford, including a 4-1 victory over Manchester United. His side did not manage a clean sheet and conceded 34 goals. Watford are currently 19th on the EPL table with 14 points from 20 matches
