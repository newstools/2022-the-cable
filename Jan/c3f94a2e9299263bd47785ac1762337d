Idowu Iluyomade, senior pastor, City of David Parish, Redeemed Christian Church of God (RCCG), has explained why a dating site was set up for Christian singles. The church had in December 2021 launched Redeemers Connect (changed to ConnectNow), an online dating platform. In a statement, Iluyomade said the site is focused on “helping single Christians find life partners”. He said while the church has a structure for pre-marriage counselling, it is lacking when it comes to providing faith-based guidance and support in the course of finding the right person for marriage. “There is a need to support them and prepare them to take this important step in their lives,” he said. Iluyomade said if singles know what to look out for in prospective spouses, the probability of success in marital life will be enhanced, adding this is the gap that ConnectNow will fill. He said the site is a “Christian relationship and interactive platform for mature adults who are ready and hoping to get married”. “It is not a dating site as the world knows it, but a faith-driven interactive community of mature believers, who are connecting with one another with a view to building enduring and fruitful Christian relationships,” he added. “This is a pre-finding marriage counselling session to prepare mature adults, who are ready for marriage for that journey of a lifetime. With the view that they make their choices in line with the fear of God and along with the dictates of our faith.” He said the platform is for mature adults, widows and widowers who are looking forward to getting married.
