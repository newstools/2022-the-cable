The shocking exit of the Super Eagles from the 2021 Africa Cup of Nations (AFCON) has dominated discourse among Nigerians on Twitter. Following the defeat to Tunisia, Nigerians on Twitter have pinned the blame on various persons, chief of which is President Muhammadu Buhari due to his pre-game call to the team. Below are some reactions from Twitter. This guy knew that speaking with Buhari meant they were going to lose  #Nigeriavstunisia pic.twitter.com/ryrfrH5i6p — DR.PENKING™ #EndPaternityFraudinNigeria (@drpenking) January 23, 2022  Thank you Umar Sadiq. You were the only spark we had today.#TeamNigeria pic.twitter.com/QyL80D4imB — Zander kesh (@ZaidyanO) January 23, 2022  Who gave Buhari the team phone Number??? #Badomen #AFCON2021 — Adetutu Balogun, MBA (@Tutsy22) January 23, 2022  Hello Buhari, with all due respect sir, we didn’t send you to call super eagles oo. — Alhaji Beardless Smallie (@SMiTHiE___) January 23, 2022  #Buhari: Musa saw it coming. I blame Desmond Elliot for all this. pic.twitter.com/8fud2GGZuO — Ayemojubar.js (@ayemojubar) January 23, 2022  Buhari Is The Reason Tunisia Defeated Nigeria So Disastrously pic.twitter.com/Wu5H8zwM9Q — Reno Omokri (@renoomokri) January 23, 2022  Iwobi red card, Iheanacho yellow card. All the time they have been playing this never happened. Why is it that it is the day they spoke to Buhari that these series of unwelcome events rained on us! Energies are very contagious. Avoid negative people! #AFCON2021 #TableShaker — Reno Omokri (@renoomokri) January 23, 2022  I can’t really connect it but I know Buhari is responsible for this loss — Imoh (@ImohUmoren) January 23, 2022  Anthony Joshua was minding his business. Eguavoen & the Super Eagles were doing a good job. Until Buhari decided to show his face. Everything Buhari touches….. — NEFERTITI (@firstladyship) January 23, 2022  Funny enough, Umar Sadiq actually had a decent game than most players who played 90 minutes. — Man City Principal   (@BarcaPrincipal) January 23, 2022  As for the red card, No body should blame iwobi for it! It's a game. I would rather blame coach for not putting umar sadiq on time Loose or gain nah Ghana go still suffer am#iwobi super eagles of Nigeria Red card Ghanaians #madukaokoye #AFCON pic.twitter.com/VUHXYdvrLv — Dr. therapist  (@EjezieThankgod) January 23, 2022  Buhari you just use f, f spoil our game. Buhari to super eagles: go and make us froud Now we don pail #Nigeriavstunisia — Dj Switch (@dj_switchaholic) January 23, 2022  This guy knew that speaking with Buhari meant they were going to lose  #Nigeriavstunisia pic.twitter.com/ryrfrH5i6p — DR.PENKING™ #EndPaternityFraudinNigeria (@drpenking) January 23, 2022  Years ago, there was a story that when people picked up some calls, they started vomiting blood, and they died.Many of us did not believe it.Today, the Super Eagles of Nigeria were expected to win until they picked that call, then they lost!#Nigeriavstunisia #AFCON — Stephen (@RealSaintSteven) January 23, 2022  The Super Eagles of Nigeria couldn't have won the #AFCON2021. We don't win the Afcon that Cameroon is involved. Check history. I told some people but they said it's superstition. Football is a spirit. Iwobi Musa Buhari Olayinka Okoye Sadiq Aina Red Card #TeamNigeria Aribo Uzoho — Church man, Florence's son (@olusolaakinwale) January 23, 2022  The motivation for a big brand such as the Super Eagles of Nigeria should never be money again. Everyone wants to call and promise ₦1m or $1m if they lift trophy. Others want to gift land in Maitama, Banana island per tackle/goal. A reflection of gross Incompetence and chaos. — Lummy Dee (@Dave_Lummy5) January 23, 2022  With all that has happened already , tomorrow is still Monday too I'm not mentally ready.
