Ahmed Musa, Super Eagles captain, has lost a loved one — barely a few days to the opening game of the 2022 African Cup of Nations (AFCON) in Cameroon. Musa was in camp with the other members of the 28-man Super Eagles squad selected by Austin Eguavoen, the team’s interim head coach, when he got the news of the demise of the father of Jamila, his first wife, in Kano state. According to sources at the camp, the 29-year-old was permitted to leave the team’s base to be with his family members following the incident. He left the camp alongside Salisu Yusuf, Eagles’ assistant coach, on Wednesday. The duo, however, returned to the team’s Abuja camp in the evening ahead of the contingents’ departure for Garoua in Cameroon later on Wednesday. Musa has been talking tough concerning the Eagles’ group opener against Egypt on January 11. He had also claimed that Nigeria has players who are “more dangerous” than Mohammed Salah, Egypt’s forwarder. The three-time African giants are billed to play Sudan and Guinea Bissau, the two other opponents in group D on January 15 and 19, respectively. Nigeria will be hoping to add another continental trophy to their cabinet and build on the triumphs of 1980, 1994 and 2013.
