The Lagos government, on Wednesday, held a meeting with stakeholders and reached a settlement plan for Shangisha landlords, the judgement creditors who have laid claim to the land where the Magodo estate phase two is located. The land has been the subject of a tussle which reportedly dates back to the 1980s, leading to a supreme court verdict ordering Lagos to give the landlords 549 plots of land as a “matter of first priority” after their properties were demolished at Shangisha. On December 21, a team of officers escorted bulldozers to the estate but residents of the area protested the move, and the police withdrew from the estate after the state intervened. On Tuesday, there was another protest at the estate following a renewed threat of demolition and police invasion. Thereafter, Babajide Sanwo-Olu, Lagos governor, visited the area and promised an “amicable resolution” to the dispute. Following the meeting involving the governor and representatives of the police, Magodo Residents Association (MRA) and the Shangisha landlords at the government house on Wednesday, an agreement was reached for the state to allocate lands to the judgment creditors.
