Ayuba Wabba, president of the Nigeria Labour Congress (NLC), says the organisation will “mobilise its 12 million members” to embark on a protest if the electoral bill is not approved. President Muhammadu Buhari had, in December 2021, withheld assent to the bill, stating that the clause recommending direct primary for political parties “violates the spirit of democracy”. Speaking on Sunday at a town hall meeting organised by Yiaga Africa, a civil society organisation, Wabba said the lawmakers should be proactive in ensuring the approval of the bill before the 2023 elections. He said the NLC expects the needful to be done before the end of January. “Time is of the essence. We ought not to be where we are on the issue of this very important bill,” he said. “I expect now that going forward, there must be a timeline. Now, there is uncertainty because the law is not in place. “We know as a matter of fact that before this January ends, we expect that the needful should be done. I want to assure you that the Nigerian workers are ready. “We are a membership-based organisation; 12 million are registered with us and they can actually push a process. “I want to assure you that between now and the 7th, we should be able to get something ready. “We care so much about this issue and know that Nigerians are very passionate about having certainty about elections. Government is government for the people by the people, so allow the people to realise what they need to do to have credible leaders in place. This is what we expect.”
