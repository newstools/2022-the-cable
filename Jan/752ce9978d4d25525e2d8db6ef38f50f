Adetoun Adediran, the first female deputy speaker of the Lagos state house of assembly, is dead. Adediran was said to have died in the early hours of Wednesday after a brief illness. She served as the first elected female deputy speaker of Lagos state house of assembly between 1999 and 2003. She was also a former women leader of the All Progressives Congress (APC), Lagos state chapter. There was a twist in the report of her death on Wednesday afternoon when social media platforms were flooded with posts indicating that she “sneezed” while being bathed in preparation for the burial. A video wherein people were seen jubilating that Adediran was alive after she was reported dead also appeared on the social media. But she was later confirmed dead by a doctor. Reacting to her demise, Femi Gbajabiamila, speaker of the house of representatives, in a statement, described as a “committed party woman”. “The speaker of the house of representatives, Rep. Femi Gbajabiamila, has expressed shock over the death of Hon. Adetoun Adediran,” the statement reads. “Gbajabiamila, on Wednesday, in a statement by his special adviser on media and publicity, Lanre Lasisi, said the death of Hon. Adetoun came as a shock because they were together a few days ago during the commissioning of projects in Surulere 1 federal constituency, where she gave a supporting hand during the ceremony. “Saying that the death of Adediran would create a void in the party as she was a very committed party woman, the Speaker noted that her wise counsel and active participation in party activities would be greatly missed. “Gbajabiamila prayed for the repose of the soul of the deceased while encouraging her family, associates, Surulere constituents, APC and Lagos state government to take solace in the knowledge that Adediran lived a fulfilled and impactful life before her demise.”
