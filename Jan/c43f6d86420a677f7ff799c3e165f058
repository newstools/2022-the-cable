The National Identity Management Commission (NIMC) has reactivated the national identity number (NIN) of Omoyele Sowore, an activist. Sowore had on January 12, raised concerns over the deactivation of his NIN, permanent voter card, passport and driver’s licence. Through his lawyer, Tope Temokun, the activist had threatened to sue NIMC and its director-general. “TAKE NOTICE that if after the expiration of SEVEN DAYS, inclusive of the date of service of this letter on you, our client’s National Identity Number (NIN) is not reactivated, we have the full instruction of our client to approach the appropriate court with jurisdiction to seek this redress and this shall be without further recourse to you,” the January 14, 2022 letter read in part. However, on Monday, Sowore in a tweet confirmed that his NIN has been reactivated by the commission. “Happy to report that after a 7-day ultimatum given to the lawless Muhammadu Buhari regime I’ve been informed that my national Identity cards have been reactivated! The struggle against tyranny continues!” he wrote.
