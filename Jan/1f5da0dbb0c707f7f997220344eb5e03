He added that the inmates were about to force their way out when security agents repelled them, killing four of them in the process. The officer added that other inmates who wanted to escape ran back to the centre. When contacted, Sola Adeotan, spokesperson of the Osun command of the correctional service, said there was no information on the incident.
