Aminu Masari, governor of Katsina, has ordered the reopening of cattle markets shut over insecurity in the state. Mustapha Inuwa, secretary to the Katsina state government, announced the decision in a statement issued on Saturday. The governor had, in an executive order signed on August 30, 2021, suspended the sale of all animals across markets in 15 LGAs and banned the movement of cattle trucks to other states in the country. The affected LGAs included Jibia, Batsari, Safana, Danmusa, Kankara, Malumfashi, Charanchi, Mai’adua, Kafur, Kafur, Faskari, Sabuwa, Baure, Dutsinma and Kaita. He also banned the sale of petrol in jerrycans to motorists at filling stations, while only two designated filling stations were allowed to “sell fuel of not more than N5,000 to motorists in Jibia Batsari, Safana, Danmusa, Kankar, Faskari, Sabuwa, Dandume, Musawa, Matazu, Dutsinma, Kurfi, Danja and Kanfur LGAs”. While announcing the reopening of the markets and the petrol stations, the governor urged the Katsina and Daura emirate councils and district heads to be cautious, adding that no act of conspiracy will be condoned. “The governor also warned that the government would not hesitate to impose the closure where a resurgence of any dubious activity is noticed,” the statement reads. “It may be recalled that the affected fuel stations and markets were closed down as part of the security challenges containment order issued by the government. “The security containment order was aimed at curtailing the supply of fuel to bandits and transactions on rustled animals in the state.”
