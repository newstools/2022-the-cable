The 22-year-old Villarreal winger described Osimhen as a “beast” and “fighter”. He said the Napoli striker will be missed when the Super Eagles kick off their Africa Cup of Nations (AFCON) campaign on Tuesday. Chukwueze, however, said the Eagles have other talented forwards that will live up to expectations. “I really miss Victor in this team. Everyone misses him. Osimhen is a fighter. He is a beast. I love playing with him and we have been playing together for so long,” Chukwueze told TheCable. “He is the only striker I know right now that can terrorise any defence in the world. He is the one I have full confidence in… that can do anything on the pitch. “But this is the situation we find ourselves now, we cannot change it. “We also have other strikers who are equally good that can get the job done too with us here.” Chukwueze said the viral video of his mother praying for him was never meant to go public, noting that it was a private moment. “It was not jazz or juju like what everyone said. It was just natural for a mother to pray for her children’s success all the time. That was what she was doing and nothing more. She’s a very good mother,” he said. “Actually, I wasn’t the one that posted the video of where my mom was praying for me. It was a friend of mine that recorded and posted on his social media handle. “I asked my friend to remove it from social media after I saw it. I was surprised. But it was already too late because some people already downloaded it and it was flying everywhere at the time. “It was a private thing. It should have remained so because I am a private person.” The 2015 FIFA U-15 bronze boot winner says he now knows how to handle a car — two years after disclosing to  TheCable that he could not drive. “Yes, I know how to drive now,” he said. Samuel Chukwueze was part of the Nigerian squad that won bronze at the 2019 AFCON in Egypt. He netted his first goal for the Eagles in a 2-1 win over South Africa in the quarter-final of the tournament.
