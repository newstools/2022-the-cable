The youth wing of the Ohanaeze Ndigbo, Igbo sociocultural association, has endorsed the 2023 presidential ambition of David Umahi, governor of Ebonyi state. Umahi on Tuesday informed President Muhammadu Buhari of his intention to join the presidential race. Damian Okafor, leader of the association, said the youths are happy with all Igbo sons and daughters that have declared their presidential ambition. Okafor spoke with journalists on Wednesday in Abakaliki, Ebonyi state capital. “We believe it is the turn of Ndigbo to take the shot at the position on equity, fairness and justice, we should encourage eminently qualified persons,” he said. “We encourage our Igbo sons and daughters across the party lines to make public their intentions for such position no matter their political party. “We are waiting for our people to come out for such a position. We celebrated senator Puis Anyim, former secretary to the government of the federation (SGF). “We celebrate governor David Umahi and senator Orji Uzor Kalu, who have also made their intentions known and we are happy on their moves. “We are happy and we encourage all of them, irrespective of the political parties because Ohaneze is apolitical.” Okafor called on other parts of the country to support the Igbo candidates for the 2023 presidential election. “Ohaneze does not belong to any political party, we stand for good governance in the efforts to move Nigeria forward,” he added.
