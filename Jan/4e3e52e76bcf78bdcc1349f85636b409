SASCARE Foundation, a not-for-profit organisation, on Saturday, hosted some women whose husbands died in active military service, to a lunch event. According to a statement by the foundation, the event, which held in Ekiti, was to commemorate the 2022 Armed Forces Remembrance Day. In attendance were “about 50 beneficiaries” who also received cash grants, commemorative plaques, and other gifts, “to help ameliorate the impact of the loss of their loved ones and breadwinners”. Mojisola Rotimi, the foundation’s executive director, said the organisation was established to sustain the legacy of Akintunde Rotimi, her late father, who was a “compassionate and dedicated humanitarian and public servant”. She said the initiative is an expression of one of the focus areas of the foundation, which is mental health and wellness for vulnerable persons, adding that “it is aimed at building a supportive community of army widows who can provide ongoing psycho-social support to one another”. On his part, Akin Rotimi, a public relations and international development professional, who is also the founder of SASCARE foundation, thanked supporters of the initiative for their generous donations. He also advocated for well-meaning individuals and civic organisations to do more to support government in efforts to improve the welfare of troops and families of fallen heroes. Speakers at the event included Olamitoyosi Omope, founder of Touching Lives Foundation, who was the guest speaker; Dauda Lawal, humanitarian and public relations expert; Rita Ilevbare, a lawyer; and Shirley Atane, also a lawyer. One of the beneficiaries, Omolola, talked about the trauma she has been going through due to the loss of Olawunmi Ojo, her husband — he was one of the seven officers who died in the Air Force Beechcraft crash on February 21, 2021. She thanked the organisation for reaching out to her and other army widows. Another beneficiary, Olubola Agboola, whose husband went missing in 2018 during an ambush by insurgents, thanked SASCARE Foundation for taking the initiative to connect her with other widows. She said she went through a very traumatic period of grieving, adding that if the community of army widows now being promoted by the foundation existed at the time, she would have been able to draw encouragement from others who had similar experiences.
