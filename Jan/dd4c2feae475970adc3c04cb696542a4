The management of Arik Air says it has increased frequencies on four of its northern routes to cope with customers’ demands. Adebanji Ola, public relations and communications manager, said this in a statement made available to TheCable on Monday. The statement said the affected routes, including Abuja-Sokoto, Abuja Kano, Abuja-Yola and Lagos-Jos, would now operate daily. It said the decision to add more frequencies to the scheduled flights on these routes was informed by the need to give customers more choices on these destinations. “Similarly, Arik Air is making its tickets more affordable by introducing N23,000 promotional fares across the network,” the statement reads. “The promotional fares which became effective on Monday, January 17, 2020, are available in all modes of sales particularly online at www.arikair.com and Arik Air’s airport/city ticketing offices.” Roy Ilegbodu, Arik Air’s chief executive officer, said the company increased frequencies on the Sokoto, Kano, Yola and Jos routes as a means of ensuring its customers’ comfort while travelling. “We want to give our customers on the Sokoto, Kano, Yola and Jos routes more choices of flights to ease their travels,” Ilegbodu said. “Also, we want to further stimulate air travel among Nigerians by introducing promotional fares.” In 2021, Arik Air reintroduced flights from Nnamdi Azikiwe Airport, Abuja to Maiduguri, Borno state and direct flights from Lagos to Kano.
