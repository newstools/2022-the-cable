The Nigeria Police Force (NPF) has countered the report by the Accident Investigation Bureau (AIB) on an accident involving a helicopter owned by the force. AIB, in a statement on Thursday, had said it was notified of the accident — which occurred on Wednesday — by the Nigerian Airspace Management Agency (NAMA). The agency said the police helicopter — Bell 429 — left Abuja on Wednesday by 4:54pm for Bauchi with six persons on board, adding that no death was recorded but there were injuries. “On 26th January, 2022, Accident Investigation Bureau, Nigeria, was notified by Nigerian Airspace Management Agency (NAMA) about an accident involving a Bell 429 helicopter with registration marks 5N-MDA owned and operated by Nigeria Police Force (NPF),” the statement issued by Tunji Oketunbi, AIB spokesperson, reads. Speaking on the incident in a statement, Frank Mba, the force spokesperson, said the incident was a “controlled safe landing”. Mba, however, said none of the six occupants sustained injuries. “The Nigeria Police Helicopter, Bell 429 5N-MDA, flying from Abuja to Bauchi on Tuesday, February 26, 2022, was involved in a controlled safe landing at the Sir Abubakar Tafawa Balewa International Airport, Bauchi,” the statement reads. “The aircraft did not crash as being reported in some sections of the media and none of the occupants sustained any injury whatsoever. All six (6) on board including the pilot and co-pilot are in good condition. “Similarly, the aircraft, which was flown by one of the best police pilots, was professionally safe-landed with minor damage on the rear rotor as a result of obstacle at the landing spot. The incident occurred around 7:30PM (local time).”
