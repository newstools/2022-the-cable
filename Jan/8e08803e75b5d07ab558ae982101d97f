Ghana Football Association (GFA) has dismissed Milovan Rajevac from his role as head coach of the Black Stars. The Serb was dismissed after an emergency meeting between the GFA and the country’s ministry of sports on Friday. At the meeting, both sides reviewed Black Stars’ performance at the ongoing Africa Cup of Nations (AFCON) in Cameroon and decided to terminate the gaffer’s contract. Ghana was eliminated from the group stage of the AFCON after they finished fourth in a group that had Morocco, Gabon and Comoros. The four-time AFCON champions picked only one point from all three games and lost 3-2 to debutants Comoros in their final group game to crash out in the preliminary stage of the continental tourney for the first time since 2006. Rajevac’s dismissal came a few hours before the Black Stars were drawn against Nigeria in the final round of the 2022 World Cup qualifiers. There are reports that an interim head coach will be named for the clash which is billed to hold between March 24 and 29, 2022. The winner of the fixture will earn one of five tickets to represent Africa at the World Cup later this year in Qatar.
