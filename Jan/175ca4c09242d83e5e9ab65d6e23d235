The Economic and Financial Crimes Commission (EFCC) says its operatives have arrested one Bolarinwa Oluwasegun for his alleged involvement in N270 million fraud. Oluwasegun was said to have presented himself as a a general in the Nigerian Army, and forged the signature of President Muhammadu Buhari in a letter he claimed was his proof of appointment. Wilson Uwujaren, EFCC’s spokesperson, in a statement on Thursday, said Oluwasegun made the false representation to defraud Kodef Clearing Resources under the pretext of securing a grant. “Operatives of the Lagos Zonal Command of the Economic and Financial Crimes Commission, EFCC, have arrested one Bolarinwa Oluwasegun, a fake Army General, for an alleged N270m fraud,” the statement reads. “The suspect, who posed as a General in the Nigerian Army, allegedly made false representations to the complainant, Kodef Clearing Resources, that the President, Muhammadu Buhari, had shortlisted him and one other to be appointed as the Chief of Army Staff, COAS, and that he needed a short grant ‘to press and process the appointment’. “He also allegedly forged a letter of appointment as COAS purportedly signed by the President and showed the same to the victim to further prove his claim. “In the said letter, he claimed that he needed to pay a certain amount of money into the coffers of the Federal Government of Nigeria, as part of the requirements for the appointment as COAS. “Oluwasegun, in his bid to defraud the victim, also allegedly forged several documents and the signature of the President.” Uwujaren said the suspect was arrested in his house in the Alagbado area of Lagos on Wednesday. Upon his arrest, six pump action guns, three cartridge bullets, a swagger stick and several forged documents were reportedly recovered from him. Uwujaren added that the suspect will be charged to court as soon as investigation is concluded.
